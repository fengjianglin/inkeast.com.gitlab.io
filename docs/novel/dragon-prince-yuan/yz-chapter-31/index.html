Streams of light seemed to flow on his skin as invisible undulations spread outwards, pushing back the surrounding lake waters such that they were unable to flow back in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the lake bank, everyone was wide-eyed and opened-mouth as they stared at him. This scene was very familiar to them. It was a scene that only appeared when one opened one’s meridian channel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Opened his third channel? How is that possible!” Green and white interlaced on Liu Xi’s attractive face as a burning sensation washed over it. She had previously mocked Zhou Yuan for overdoing it. Who could have anticipated that the latter would not only be uninjured, but even unblock his third meridian channel on the very spot!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The expression in Qi Yue’s eyes turned ominously stormy at this moment. His five fingers were tightly clenched as he stared at Zhou Yuan like a viper while rage boiled in his heart. He had similarly never imagined such an outcome.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, what he could not fathom was how Zhou Yuan’s mere two channel body could possible endure for an hour in the Jade Spirit Waterfall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How did he do it!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other B class members were speechless as they looked to each other, evidently both intimidated and in awe of this scene.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the lake, bright light flashed in Zhou Yuan’s tightly shut eyes as they slowly cracked open. He lowered his head, looking at the swirling Genesis Qi light surging around his body. Unrestrained joy bubbled in his heart as he felt the now completely unblocked third meridian channel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He too never expected that he would actually open his third meridian channel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">According to his original estimate, he would need at least several days of training. However, he seemed to have somewhat underestimated the quartz energy of the Jade Spirit Waterfall. The tremendous amount of quartz energy absorbed had allowed him to unblock his third meridian channel today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Unfortunately, the quartz energy was likely so effective because it was my first time absorbing it. Once my body becomes accustomed to it, there will no longer be such quick and visible results.” Zhou Yuan muttered to himself as joy was revealed in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even so, opening his third meridian channel made Zhou Yuan exceptionally happy. After all, it had only been a few days since he had unblocked his second channel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a soft inward chuckle, the tip of Zhou Yuan’s foot pushed as his body flew to the lake bank. When he raised his head, he found everyone staring at him in complete silence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Clap clap!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Applause suddenly rang out. Chu Tianyang’s usually unsmiling and serious face was currently decorated by a warm smile. His eyes filled with emotion as he stared at Zhou Yuan and clapped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Su Youwei, Yang Zai, Song Qiushui and the rest came back to their senses and immediately started clapping too as their faces flooded with excitement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They had just earlier been intimidated by Qi Yue, causing their morale to plummet. Who could have imagined that Qi Yue’s record would be broken by Zhou Yuan in the blink of an eye, even leaving the former far far behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a mere two channel body, he had persisted in the Jade Spirit Waterfall for an hour. This was something that had never happened before in the Great Zhou Institute.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The crowd’s clapping first stunned Zhou Yuan, but he soon broke out into a smile. Next, he lifted his head and his line of sight turned towards Qi Yue and the rest of the B class students.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon seeing Zhou Yuan look over, the B class members seemed to shrink back as their faces burned. After all, they had been mocking him just moments ago and before they could even blink, their mockery had now turned on them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Xi’s steely-green face had twisted in an extremely ugly manner, but she could not utter even a single word. All she could do was bite down forcefully on her teeth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the contrary, Qi Yue wore a dark expression as a sinister voice seeped out between the crevices of his teeth, “Good, excellent. Your highness really surpasses one’s expectations.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Yuan swept an indifferent glance at Qi Yue and replied with a faint smile, “Behave yourselves if you want to watch and stop trying to hold a drama here, we really don’t have time to entertain you guys.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The corners of Qi Yue’s eyes twitched, but he ultimately took in a deep breath, suppressing the rage in his heart. However, the eyes that looked towards Zhou Yuan had become increasingly menacing and cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Yuan no longer bothered with Qi Yue after seeing this. He turned his head and smiled towards Su Youwei, Yang Zai, Song Qiushui and the rest as he said, “Let’s continue. There’s not much time left.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of the 6 hours they had, almost half had passed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Responded all the A class students, their morale rapidly rising. The gazes that looked towards Zhou Yuan were much different than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before, there existed a tiny bit of the mentality of a senior student viewing a new student. However, not only had Zhou Yuan’s accomplishment intimidated Qi Yue and the rest of the B class, it had also made them, the A class students, feel more respect for the former.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By the side, Chu Tianyang secretly breathed a sigh of relief as he watched the A class students regain their morale. The gaze with which he looked towards Zhou Yuan had subconsciously become increasingly pleased.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Over the past year, Qi Yue was practically a boulder that weighed heavily in the hearts of all the A class students, making them feel as if they would never be able to prevail over him. But Zhou Yuan had let everyone know today that it was not impossible to beat Qi Yue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the saying went, there was always someone better. No one had been able to keep Qi Yue in check because that someone had yet to appear… but now…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That someone had perhaps finally appeared. Chu Tianyang secretly thought as he looked at Zhou Yuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under the Jade Spirit Waterfall, the now spirited A class students continued their training once again. While the thundering waterfall washed over them, the figures standing within seemed to have become much more powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the following period of time, Zhou Yuan maintained his 1 hour timing during each attempt, a fact that made everyone exclaim in admiration. No one could understand how he did it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most importantly, Zhou Yuan was still rather lively even after enduring for an hour, and few bruises could be seen on his body. This appearance made it seem as if the waterfall was unable to damage him at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hence, the gazes which looked towards Zhou Yuan grew increasingly respectful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The 6 hour training session soon came to an end. Subsequently, the spirited A class students walked past the B class students under Zhou Yuan’s lead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The B class students were silent as they watched them leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liu Xi hatefully gnashed her teeth and said, “Acting so pleased just because he was able to persist a short while longer! Does he really think that opening his third meridian channel will allow him to fly?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Qi Yue, you cannot allow him to keep doing as he pleases!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qi Yue was expressionless as he coldly said, “What’s the rush.”</span></p>
