 <p>Hey guys, I'm excited to let you know that <a href="https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/physicians-odyssey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Physician's Odyssey</a> is now out of sneak peek and available for everyone to read, with 60 chapters to start! &nbsp;This is a modern wuxia novel that is part of our big 2019 kickoff to more genres.&nbsp; Authored by Smoking Pipe Bro and translated by Wuxiaworld veteran Thyaeria (who is also working with us on The Great Ruler and Tales of Demons &amp; Gods), this Zongheng novel brings us the story of the brilliant physician Su Tao.&nbsp; Su Tao is a medical genius, but just wants to maintain...</p>

<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What do you mean?” Su Youwei was stunned by Zhou Yuan’s words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan’s eyes were a little cold as he looked towards Cao Ling and Fan Wei and said in a flat voice, “If my guess is correct, they have used the Blood Boiling Rune.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Blood Boiling Rune?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan slowly explained, “It is a grade 1 Genesis Rune which uses Genesis Beast essence blood as an anchor. When drawn on the body, it can burn the essence blood in the body, allowing one’s Genesis Qi to become berserk and violent. However, it is very harmful to the user and will cause a loss of essence blood. In serious cases, it may even damage one’s meridian channels, making it difficult to progress one’s cultivation in future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Blood Boiling Rune was somewhat similar to the Nine Beast Channel Opening Rune. However, the former was not as refined at the latter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The expression in Su Youwei’s pretty face changed slightly. “Such Genesis Runes are forbidden! They wouldn’t dare!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan’s eyes narrowed. “They’ve concealed it well, making it extremely difficult to discover. It is likely that no runes can be found on their bodies.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Can’t be found? Then how were they drawn?” Su Youwei was puzzled. She was clearly not as proficient in Genesis Runes as Zhou Yuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan slowly explained, “They probably had the Blood Boiling Rune inscribed on their bodies every day before the class ranking exam, allowing some of the rune’s power to remain in the body. Hence, the blood within their bodies will gradually start to boil as the battles intensifies. As such, no one will be able to find out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“However, this will cause even greater harm to the users body. I’m afraid that Cao Ling and Fan Wu will likely become cripples in the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Youwei could not help but clench her jaw. “How vicious.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Coldness flashed in Zhou Yuan’s eyes as he said, “Looks like Qi Manor is very prudent. To think that they would resort to such tactics to ensure that nothing unexpected would happen even with Qi Yue at the helm. It seems that they are very determined on obtaining the Great Zhou Institute.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They likely plan on using Fan Wu and Cao Ling to tire you.” Su Youwei’s eyes narrowed a little, a stern look emerging in them as her hand slowly closed into a fist. “But don’t worry, I will not let them succeed!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She could vaguely sense how important this class ranking exam was to Zhou Yuan and intended to do everything in her power to help him. For him, she would sweep away all of the stumbling blocks in his path. At the very least, she needed to ensure Zhou Yuan was at his peak condition when he faced Qi Yue and not allow anyone to tire him out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan had begun to think of a way to deal with the situation, but it was at this moment that a ball of paper was suddenly thrown over, landing at his side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan was taken aback. He picked up the ball of paper and slowly unfurled it, only to find three beautifully drawn words: Clear Heart Rune.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“These words… big sis Yaoyao?” Zhou Yuan was stunned. Subsequently, he raised his head and looked towards a distant platform where Yaoyao was holding Tuntun as she lazily observed the field. As if sensing his gaze, Yaoyao tilted her head and gave him a small smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was obvious that she had also discovered the problem. Her mastery of Genesis Runes was even greater than Zhou Yuan, hence she had very quickly worked out a solution.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So that’s how…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With this pointer from Yaoyao, Zhou Yuan immediately understood. He grinned as he turned to Su Youwei and said, “It is not impossible to deal with the Blood Boiling Rune. Give me your hand.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Youwei was a little confused but she still reached out a hand as instructed. He her hand was soft, supple, fair and slender, while her nails were akin to little shells, neat and cute.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without much thought, Zhou Yuan also reached out and grabbed Su Youwei’s small hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Upon seeing his actions, Su Youwei was a little alarmed as her face flushed red. However, before she could say anything, Zhou Yuan retrieved the Heavenly Yuan Brush from his waist and swiftly started to draw on her palm with a serious expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was soon done, and continued to hold Su Youwei’s hand as he said in a low voice, “This is the Clear Heart Rune. Although it is only an elementary level rune, it will be very useful in this situation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Clear Heart Rune?” Su Youwei was somewhat surprised. She naturally knew of this elementary rune but did not understand how it would be of use against the Blood Boiling Rune</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan smiled and said in a mysterious manner, “When they activate the Blood Boiling Rune later, use this hand to attack the top of their head.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although she was still somewhat puzzled, Su Youwei obediently nodded. Her clear-water-like eyes subsequently looked towards Zhou Yuan as she said with a red face, “Are still not going to let go?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only then did Zhou Yuan realise that he was still holding a small, soft hand and immediately released his grip. Soon after, he said without a change in expression, “I was talking about important matters and did not intend to take advantage.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Youwei softly snorted. “You’ve become accustomed to it anyways.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan felt somewhat embarrassed. Just as he was about to try and explain, he saw Yang Zai and Song Qiushui walk over with shame on their faces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sorry. We lost.” The two hung their heads in dejection. Zhou Yuan had won two hours of Jade Spirit Waterfall training time for them, but they had still lost in the class ranking exam, making them feel that they had let him down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan did not seem to mind as he smiled and said, “Don’t mind it, it was not your skills that were lacking but our opponents’ tactics that were far too devious.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He lifted his head and looked at the class leader platform, only to see Qi Yue look back with a superficial smile. From the curve of his lips, it was as if victory was already assured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Already so happy huh…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan withdrew his gaze as an icy smile emerged on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this current moment, countless gazes from the field were looking towards the A class. Evidently, the A class’ two consecutive losses had led many believe that they would once again be suppressed by the B class.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Several factions were also mumbling to themselves, “Looks like the Great Zhou Institute is really going to fall into Qi Manor’s hands.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Youwei stood up under the attention of these gazes. She was wearing black training attire today, consisting of a black shirt and black pants. The clothes outlined her slender figure and the rise and fall of her ample bosom, while the waistband around her waist further enunciated an unreasonable tiny waist. A ponytail hung over her back, emitting a youthful vibe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m going.” Su Youwei smiled at Zhou Yuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Go for it.” Zhou Yuan responded with a nod and smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Youwei looked at Zhou Yuan. As the rays of the sun shined down on her, it seemed as if she had the attention of the entire world. She gave him a slight smile that was both bright and enchanting and in a voice only the two of them could hear, she said, “Your highness, when you kicked open a set of doors for me back then, I told myself that I would do my best to become very strong. I will make sure that all hindrances will not be able to touch you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When her final word faded, the young girl had already agilely flew forth with a light push off the ground. She landed on the tall stage as a clear voice sounded, “A class’ Su Youwei challenges B class’ Cao Ling.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This clear and pleasant voice drew the attention of countless gazes. When they saw the valiant and elegant girl on the stage, they could not help inwardly cheer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The jealousy in Liu Xi’s eyes multiplied as she watched Su Youwei draw more and more attention. “Cao Ling, go teach her a lesson!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cao Ling soundlessly stood up and ascended the stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Begin!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the referee signalled the start of the match, the Genesis Qi around Cao Ling’s body immediately erupted. Six meridian channels were instantly opened as Genesis Qi surged into his limbs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His body shot forth like a panther as deadly fist-winds ripped through the air, turning into countless punches that seemed to envelope Su Youwei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In response to Cao Ling’s flurry of attacks, Su Youwei gracefully shifted like a wisp of smoke. Each time an attack was about to land, she would borrow the incoming force to cleverly avoid, causing Cao Ling’s attacks to be unable to connect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, Cao Ling frantically attacked on the stone stage while Su Youwei effortlessly dodged in a manner that was neither hurried nor slow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As time passed, red light surfaced in Cao Ling’s eyes once again, while the Genesis Qi in his body gradually turned violent as his blood boiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Get lost!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a stamp, Cao Ling’s figure bulleted forward, appearing in front of Su Youwei as a palm was swung horizontally in a ferocious and imposing manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, just as his palm-wind whizzed forth, Su Youwei style did a 180, now advancing instead of retreating. A fair hand gently landed on Cao Ling’s head as the Genesis Rune on her palm emitted a faint glow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A refreshing aura tunnelled into Cao Ling’s head, causing the boiling blood within his body to suddenly turn peaceful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This sudden change also made the berserking Genesis Qi fade and the contrast caused the Genesis Qi in Cao Ling’s body to fall into chaos.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swish!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Youwei decisively attacked. Two fingers suffused with jade light ripped through the air and swiftly hit Cao Ling’s chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Urgh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cao Ling’s figure jerked as a mouthful of fresh blood was vomited from his mouth before crashing to the ground on his back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">*Uproar*!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entire field erupted. No one had expected the previously unstoppable Cao Ling to be so easily defeated at Su Youwei’s hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under countless gazes of shock, Su Youwei’s pretty face remained as calm as water. She merely looked towards the class leader platform as a flat voice followed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Next.”</span></p>
