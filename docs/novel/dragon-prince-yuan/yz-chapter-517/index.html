 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Numerous Sword Cometh Peak disciples stood in the air some distance from the island where the Saint Genesis Peak disciples were stationed, watching the latter like tigers eyeing their prey.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A tall young man stood in front of them with his hands behind his back. He had a sharp gaze, while powerful Genesis Qi undulations pulsed from his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This person was called Zhong Yun, and was no ordinary disciple. He had been one of the strongest contenders for the previous chief disciple selection, but had ultimately lost to Baili Che, losing him the chance of becoming chief disciple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he lost to Baili Che, Zhong Yun was a proud individual that refused to accept the results. In addition, he had some conflicts with Baili Che, and had thus been sent here by the latter to be excluded from the main mission.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhong Yun gazed at the island from far away with a gloomy expression as he snorted and said, “Humph, sending me here for a mere Saint Genesis Peak. Baili Che is too much!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The surrounding disciples laughed awkwardly, not daring to openly agree. Zhong Yun may dare to curse Baili Che but the same could not be said for them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior brother Zhong Yun, we’ve already surrounded them for two days, but there seems to be no activity from Saint Genesis Peak…” A disciple hurriedly tried to change the topic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Disdain and mockery were revealed on Zhong Yun’s face as he said, “What can the few hundred of them do? Do they really believe they’ll be able to overturn the heavens because they have a chief disciple?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Zhou Yuan merely managed to beat Yuan Hong. If he was in our Sword Cometh Peak’s selection instead, he won’t even make it to the top five.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If not for Zhou Xiaoyao and that mysterious little creature, I would have charged in and eliminated all of them from the Genesis reservoir ceremony.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Like Baili Che, Zhong Yun clearly did not think much of the Saint Genesis Peak chief disciple, Zhou Yuan. Though they had both participated in their respective chief disciple selection, the difficulty of Saint Genesis Peak’s was clearly not on the same level as Sword Cometh Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The disciples around him voiced their agreement one after another. Soon after, someone remarked with some hesitation, “But regardless of how we toyed with the Saint Genesis Peak disciples over the past two days, Zhou Yuan and Zhou Xiaoyao still refused to show themselves. This is quite odd.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhong Yun’s eyes narrowed slightly. He had clearly also made the same observation. He peered at the depths of the island and muttered, “Zhou Yuan doesn’t have much ability, and is nothing to be feared, but Zhou Xiaoyao is someone that even our two Chosens do not dare to underestimate… holing themselves inside and refusing to leave… they’re likely up to something.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His eyes flickered brightly in thought. After a long time, he said in a low voice, “Wu Qingteng, you’ll lead eight hundred disciples and feign an attack from the right to draw the attention of the Saint Genesis Peak disciples and that mysterious little creature. I’ll use the diversion to lead two hundred elite disciples into the island to ascertain what Zhou Yuan and Zhou Xiaoyao are up to inside!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other Sword Cometh Peak disciples were clearly bored out of their minds from being stationed here long ago. They immediately jerked to attention upon hearing that Zhong Yun planned to attack the island, and acknowledged in unison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Understood!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sword Cometh Peak’s attack began after one incense stick of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The disturbance immediately caused a flurry of activity amongst the numerous Saint Genesis Peak disciples. In the end, Zhou Tai, Zhang Yan and Lu Yan led the disciples to meet the incoming attack, causing a chaotic battle to break out on the surface of the sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tuntun lazily joined the battlefield, but the Sword Cometh Peak disciples merely fled one after another wherever it passed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While the chaos ensued, the two hundred elite disciples led by Zhong Yun stealthily slipped into the island, and swiftly began their search.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They finished searching the entire island after a few dozen minutes. To Zhong Yun’s surprise, they had failed to find any traces of Zhou Yuan or Zhou Xiaoyao, neither were there any signs of the duo appearing in the battle outside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The two of them aren’t here!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhong Yun’s face was filled with astonishment, as a mocking smoke began to appear from the corners of his lips. “Could the two of them have left the Saint Genesis Peak disciples behind to hunt for Genesis essence on their own?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s pretty smart of them. Since they knew that the Saint Genesis Peak disciples are basically a lost hope, why not hunt for more Genesis essence by themselves.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swish! Swish!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhong Yun lifted his head and looked in a certain direction, where Zhou Tai, Zhang Yan and Lu Yan were hastily rushing back with a group of disciples, evidently realizing that the former had infiltrated the island.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An evil look flashed across Zhong Yun’s eyes when he saw this, before he loudly shouted, “Idiots from Saint Genesis Peak, Zhou Yuan and Zhou Xiaoyao have already abandoned you useless fools long ago. It’s laughable that all of you are still stupidly guarding this place!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Zhou Tai trio and the other disciples froze as they stared at the island in shock, clearly unaware that the island they had so painstakingly guarded had been empty all along.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other disciples looked at each other as defeated looks rose on their faces. The already low morale began to crumble at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan and Zhou Xiaoyao were their hopes for the Genesis reservoir ceremony. Not knowing where the two of them were now was clearly quite a huge blow to everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Zhou Tai trio fell silent as they gazed at the defeated Saint Genesis Peak disciples with complicated expressions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Upon seeing this, Zhong Yun could not help but laugh to himself in a pleased manner. “I advise you guys to voluntarily withdraw from the ceremony to prevent yourselves from being humiliated even further.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In addition, that chief disciple of yours seems to be really undependable.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhong Yun laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other Sword Cometh Peak disciples around him also began to laugh, their gazes filled with ridicule as they looked towards the Saint Genesis Peak crowd.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Saint Genesis Peak disciples were unable to speak as they numbly accepted the other party’s mocking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lu Yan’s pretty face turned ashen as she shouted, “Shut up!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhong Yun disdainfully said, “I’ll give all of you one day. If you don’t voluntarily withdraw from the ceremony, don’t blame us for not showing any courtesy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He beckoned with his hand, indicating for the Sword Cometh Peak disciples to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, just as he was about to turn around, a calm voice suddenly sounded in everyone’s ears, “Since you’re already here, where else do you plan on going?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhong Yun’s figure turned rigid as he jerked his head to the side, where a young figure had appeared at some unknown time atop a cliff and was staring at him with an expressionless face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Surprised noises erupted from Zhou Tai, Lu Yan and the other Saint Genesis Peak disciples. “Chief disciples!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The figure belonged to Zhou Yuan, who had been missing for the past few days!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhong Yun also stared at Zhou Yuan in confusion. “Where did you pop out from?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had clearly searched the entire island earlier, but had not discovered any signs of Zhou Yuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan did not reply, merely continuing to coldly stare at Zhong Yun. The former raised his foot, and his figure suddenly appeared in front of the latter like a phantom as a punch was thrown.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fool!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhong Yun’s expression immediately turned frosty upon seeing that Zhou Yuan actually dared to attack, as a sinister smile was revealed, “Do you really believe that the chief disciple of Saint Genesis Peak is worth anything in my eyes?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Since you want to be humiliated, allow me to show you the gap between your Saint Genesis Peak and my Sword Cometh Peak!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rumble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Alarmingly powerful Genesis Qi abruptly exploded from his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Though he said so, Zhong Yun did not show any mercy. His hands came together, before abruptly pulling away as a dark blue sword took shape between his palms, pulsing with an aura of endless sharpness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Blue Moon Shadow Sword!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a stern shout, the blue sword zipped forth, transforming into a blur of blue as it shot towards Zhou Yuan at a speed that was nearly impossible to detect with the naked eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As sword light flashed past, even space itself was split apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was essentially a killing move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Blue sword light rapidly expanded in Zhou Yuan’s pupils. However, he remained expressionless as jade light emerged from his skin, while silver light blossomed in his bones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Genesis Qi rushed through his meridian channels.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rumble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Five fingers tightly clenched into a fist as a punch was thrown.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Snow-white brush hairs flew out from his sleeves and wrapped around his fist like a gauntlet that was rapidly dyed black...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Genesis Breaker!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fist and sword light collided.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re courting death!” Zhong Yun’s sinister voice sounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Crack!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, his pupils abruptly shrank the moment the words left his mouth as horror rapidly flooded them. Because he had just seen his blue sword light being shattered by the punch!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How can this be?!” A terrified voice escaped from his mouth. He was unable to believe that his full power attack would be shattered by Zhou Yuan’s punch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The hairs on Zhong Yun’s body stood on ends as unease crept up within him. Zhou Yuan did not seem to be as weak as he had imagined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swish!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His figure rapidly darted backwards in an attempt to avoid the attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment his body moved, however, he saw a fist hurtling through the air, the five fingers opening to grab his throat like an eagle’s claw.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan slowly lifted his head, expressionless as he looked at the raised Zhong Yun and offhandedly said, “You don’t seem to be very strong, so why are you so boastful?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Saint Genesis Peak disciples burst into cheers upon seeing Zhou Yuan display his amazing abilities and capture Zhong Yun in a single move. They finally felt a little better after being depressed for so many days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ashen-faced Zhong Yun struggled as he sternly croaked, “Zhou Yuan, you’d better believe me when I saw Sword Cometh Peak will declare war on you guys if you touch me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sword Cometh Peak disciples behind him also yelled, “Release senior brother Zhong Yun or our Sword Cometh Peak will crush you guys!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The cheering from the Saint Genesis Peak disciples immediately stopped, evidently feeling the pressure from Sword Cometh Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ridicule flowed out in Zhong Yun’s eyes when he saw this. He viciously glared at Zhou Yuan and shouted, “Release me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With Sword Cometh Peak behind him, he absolutely did not believe that Zhou Yuan dared to try anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">*Slap*!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the words had barely left his mouth when a palm viciously swung towards him, and slapped him in the face, causing blood to drip from the corner of his mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan withdrew his hand, casually swinging it, as he frowned and said, “Don’t be so noisy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhong Yun was stunned. His face twisted a split second later as he looked towards Zhou Yuan and howled, “You dare to hit me?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thud!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reply he received was a punch that could split a mountain. A sonic boom was heard as a fist slammed into Zhong Yun’s chest and sent him flying. He smashed into several cliffs, before being buried by the falling boulders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entire island and the area around it was completely silent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone stared in disbelief at this scene, especially the Sword Cometh Peak disciples. Never in their wildest dreams would they have imagined that Zhou Yuan would be so bold as to pummel Zhong Yun without the slightest shred of hesitation...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Saint Genesis Peak disciples swallowed repeatedly, likewise awed by Zhou Yuan’s actions. While they were in awe, a boiling sensation began to flow inside of them. Zhou Yuan had already used his actions to show that he would not yield in the face of Sword Cometh Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan tilted his head slightly, looking towards Zhou Tai and the rest of the Saint Genesis Peak disciples as he said, “Are you guys afraid?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The numerous disciples looked at each other. In the end, someone gritted his teeth and said, “We’re not afraid of Sword Cometh Peak as long as we have you, chief disciple!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan softly chuckled, before pointing towards the remaining Sword Cometh Peak disciples. “In that case, make sure none of them leave this place.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“From now on…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Saint Genesis Peak shall declare war on Sword Cometh Peak.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Zhou Yuan’s final word faded, all of the Saint Genesis Peak disciples felt the blood in their bodies begin to boil.</span></p>
