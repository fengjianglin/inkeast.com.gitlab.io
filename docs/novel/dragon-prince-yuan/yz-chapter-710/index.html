 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The battle between Yaoyao and Wu Yao came to a stop due to the sneak attack the young man in black had launched on Zhou Yuan as Yaoyao’s eyes turned exceptionally icy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a look that had not appeared even in the fight against Wu Yao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Evidently, she had truly been angered at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yao naturally sensed the changes in Yaoyao’s expression. However, she was also unhappy about the young man in black’s actions deep inside. She was a strong-minded person by nature, and although she hell-bent on obtaining the sacred dragon qi in Zhou Yuan’s body, she did not wish to borrow help from another, but seeked to win it with her own abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Below, the young man in black that had been called Zhao Yunxiao by Wu Yao was naturally able to hear the anger in Wu Yao’s voice, causing him to smile in a somewhat helpless manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had originally not intended to take action. After all, he felt that the initial Divine Dwelling stage Zhou Yuan was naturally incapable of escaping from Wu Yao’s hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But who could have expected Yaoyao’s sudden appearance. Moreover, she was alarmingly powerful and not the least bit inferior to Wu Yao. As a result, he had planned to take action in secret; he would gravely injure Zhou Yuan and help Wu Yao obtain the sacred dragon qi to win her favor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Who could have expected Wu Yao to show no appreciation for his thoughtfulness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Yunxiao smiled at Wu Yao before he raised his hands in the air and said, “Aiyah aiyah, don’t be angry. Alright, I won’t interfere. I’ll leave this brat to you, that should be okay, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he was only looking towards Wu Yao in a seemingly apologetic manner. His gaze did not even glance at Zhou Yuan, who had nearly been killed by his palm strike earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pchla!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As his voice rang out, however, Yaoyao suddenly jerked her hand with an ice-cold face. She did not utter a single word as the long whip made from Spirit Flames tore through the air and mercilessly lashed at Zhao Yunxiao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhan Yunxiao’s pupils shrank at the sight of the rapidly approaching whip. Against her, he did not dare to be as negligent as he had been with Zhou Yuan. Her mighty Spirit power was definitely something he needed to be wary of.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, Zhao Yunxiao’s foot immediately stomped on the ground as surging Genesis Qi whizzed out of his body. Light gathered behind him, forming three Divine Dwelling halos.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The halos gave off an eight-color light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Yunxiao was likewise at the advanced Divine Dwelling Stage, and had established an eight heavens Divine Dwelling!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although it was somewhat inferior to Wu Yao’s, establishing an eight heavens Divine Dwelling was already the mark of a top-tier genius.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bzz!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Spirit Flame whip descended, ruthlessly whipping towards the revolving halos around Zhao Yunxiao. A sound akin to muffled thunder rang out as the Divine Dwelling halos violently shuddered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Spirit Flame whip attacks grew increasingly deadly, causing the halos to tremble as if on the verge of collapsing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Yunxiao’s expression changed slightly. He had not underestimated Yaoyao in the slightest, but never expected that he would still misjudge her Spirit mastery. Such capabilities would rank her amongst the top even in the Divine Dwelling stage of Hunyuan Heaven.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While confusion filled Zhao Yunxiao’s heart, the Divine Dwelling halos around him reached their limit and exploded with a loud boom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A lightning glow emerged on his body as he disappeared from the spot. He reappeared in the sky far away, a grave expression filling his handsome and fair face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It had only taken a brief contact for his protective halos to be breached. From this, one could see just how powerful Yaoyao’s attacks were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Miss, there is no need to be so overbearing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Amazement flashed in Zhao Yunxiao’s eyes as he looked towards Yaoyao. Wu Yao was considered the most outstanding amongst the many young ladies he had encountered before. Hence why she constantly occupied the mind of someone like himself who had exceedingly high standards, and he had even happily followed her to Cangxuan Heaven. He had originally believed that there was no girl in this world who could surpass Wu yao, but Yaoyao was clearly not the least bit inferior to Wu Yao in every aspect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Yunxiao cast a glance at Zhou Yuan below, as a sliver of envy rose from the depths of his heart. To think that this rat-like brat would have some relation with these two exceptional girls. He must have been some kind of saint in his previous life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan stood up and quickly scanned the somewhat shattered silver armor on his body as a chilling iciness flashed past in the depths of his eyes. If not for his vigilance, he would have likely been gravely injured or even killed earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yaoyao’s figure landed beside Zhou Yuan, her clear eyes staring at a certain spot as she said, “Careful, there’s still someone else here and he or she is very powerful!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan was immediately alarmed by these words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Yaoyao’s voice rang out, an elderly voice sounded from nowhere, “Hehe, what a sharp little girl.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan saw a black robed elder slowly emerge from nowhere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan’s entire body tensed up at the sight of the black robed elder as his expression turned graver. The aura from the black robed elder was not something the likes of them could contend against.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The black robed elder glanced at Zhou Yuan and waved his hands. “No need to be nervous little ones, this old man will not interfere.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He raised his head and stared at the sky as he smiled and continued, “Moreover, it will become rather messy if I do. Your Cangxuan Sect will likely not take this lying down.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had evidently sensed several extremely powerful existences watching this place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The black robed elder turned his head, casting his gaze towards Wu Yao as he said, “Little lass, I’m afraid that today’s matter can no longer continue. I hope that you will quit while you’re still ahead.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yao gave a faint nod as her body slowly descended.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her eyes first looked towards Yaoyao for a moment before turning towards Zhou Yuan. She stared at him for quite some time before her red lips opened slightly, “The struggle for the sacred dragon blessing will not end until it is made whole, even if it has to end in either of our deaths.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Zhou Yuan, it may perhaps be as the prophecy says. Between you and I, only the devourer will live.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I will not deny that the sacred dragon blessing originated from you. However, the path of cultivation is essentially akin to a war in which I will not show even the slightest shred of mercy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Although the sacred dragon blessing is my most hated thing, it has indeed benefitted me over the years. Hence, regardless of everything that has happened, I do owe you a debt.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She took in a deep breath before she continued, “If there is a chance in future, I will naturally pay back this debt if it does not infringe upon the fight for the sacred dragon blessing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan felt rather surprised inside as he gazed upon Wu Yao’s beautiful face. When he encountered Wu Huang and King Wu in the past, neither would acknowledge that the sacred dragon blessing originated from him. In fact, Wu Huang had repeatedly called him a false dragon that was merely a container.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only Wu Yao genuinely understood the truth and did not make up an excuse to hide it. Although she was a girl, she was far more open-minded than Wu Huang and King Wu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though he had such thoughts, Zhou Yuan was not going to back down. He knew that this girl was far from anything Wu Huang could ever amount to, and was a million times more dangerous than King Wu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I will eventually take back what belongs to me. These things are not yours.” Zhou Yuan remained firm, refusing to display even a hint of concession.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The black lightning around Wu Yao slowly withdrew as the sun shined on her fair face, making it glow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If there comes a day when you are truly able to take the sacred dragon blessing from me, it will naturally be proof of your ability. If that day does come, I will not utter a single word of unfairness even if it results in my death.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yao stared at Zhou Yuan as she continued, “Of course, I hope that you will be the one to personally take back the sacred dragon blessing and not borrow the hand of someone else.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this point, she cast a glance at Yaoyao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yaoyao indifferently said, “If you weren’t being protected by someone else, you would not have been able to leave today.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She shot a glance at the black robed elder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yao’s eyes narrowed slightly as if she were a phoenix whose dignity had been challenged. Her voice turned icier as she said, “Although your Spirit is strong, I do not fear you in a real fight.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The gazes of the two young ladies clashed, hostility bristling between them for a time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The black robed elder helplessly chuckled. Although Wu Yao was usually quite unyielding by nature, not just any ordinary person could provoke anger from her. However, Yaoyao was akin to a barrel of gunpowder for Wu Yao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two young ladies did not come to blows again in the end because they both knew that it would be pointless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan softly chuckled as he gazed at Wu Yao and said, “When Wu Huang’s name shocked the Cangmang Continent, I was not even able to cultivate. If I was unafraid back then, what do I have to fear since we’re both at the Divine Dwelling stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So you should be more careful instead. I’m afraid you won’t have the same advantage the next time we meet.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Arrogant rat.” Wu Yao did say anything, but Zhao Yunxiao smilingly said with disdain in his eyes, “Do you really believe that your pitiful accomplishments in Cangxuan Heaven gives you the right to brag?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You should know that Cangxuan Heaven is not even worth mentioning when compared to Hunyuan Heaven.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hence, you should clearly understand that there is a gap between the true geniuses of our two worlds...and you should never mix them up.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan looked towards Zhao Yunxiao as he calmly said, “If there is a chance in the future, I will return the strike you gave me earlier.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Yunxiao lightly clapped as he smilingly said, “I’ll be more than happy to accept it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, his expression clearly indicated that he merely treated Zhou Yuan’s words as a joke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yao looked deeply at Zhou Yuan. She was much better informed of what the latter had gone through and was honestly very amazed by how he had risen from what should have been the pits of despair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From a feeble young man who could not even unblock his eight meridian channels, he had killed Wu Huang and even destroyed the Great Wu Empire...the person who once bore the sacred dragon blessing was indeed no ordinary individual.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Wu Yao was likewise a proud person who did not believe she would lose to anyone, even the young man who was once the sacred dragon of the Zhou clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, she nodded to Zhou Yuan and said, “I’ll be waiting.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She withdrew her gaze and turned towards the lonely grave as she softly said, “Elder Yan, please allow me to pay my final respects to mother.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The black robed elder gave a faint nod.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yao slowly walked towards the gravestone. She stared at the words on the stone as if once again seeing the kind mother that had always protected her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She knelt before the grave and bowed deeply.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mother, the Great Wu Empire is gone. Everything that happened in the past has already been settled today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“From this point onwards, Yao’er will be all alone in this world and will no longer have anything that can tie her down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is goodbye. I hope that mother will take good care of yourself below.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yao kowtowed, closing her eyes as her long eyelashes trembled faintly. In the end, a crystal-clear teardrop rolled down her cheek and fell to the ground, shattering into a million pieces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She knew that she would likely never return.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her past had now dissipated like smoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yao’s remained in that position for a long time. In the end, she restrained the feelings in her heart and slowly rose to her feet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Wu Yao turned around again, Zhou Yuan could feel that she seemed to have become much calmer. Rather than calmness, it seemed more akin to some kind of cold indifference. It seemed that she was finally able to let things go with that final kowtow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The past had been sealed deep within her heart, fated to be frozen there forever.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Likewise, the once kind heart had slowly been covered by layer after layer of thick and solid ice with not even the tiniest of chinks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Let that once pure and kind little princess of the Great Zhou Empire die...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the future, there will only be the Wu Yao that seeks the path of the strongest.</span></p>
