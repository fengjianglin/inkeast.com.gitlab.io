 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the vast courtyard, two sets of people stood opposite each other. The atmosphere was tense and hostile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Muxin stood at the forefront of the crowd, her face icy cold, her eyes fixed on the opposite side. In front of the numerous disciples from the Sacred Palace, there were two figures standing with their hands clasped behind their backs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The one of the left was clothed in white. He had a long and slender body and radiated an aura of elegance. His lips were thin, and when he smiled, he exuded sharpness.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was the leader of the ten chief disciples from the Sacred Palace—the Heavenly Sacred Hall chief disciple Huo Tian. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And beside Huo Tian, there was a tall and burly man. He was clad in black and had a stern look on his face. His eyes flickered with a fierce glint, making him look like a terrifying ape.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was ranked second among the ten Sacred Palace chief disciples and was the chief disciple of the Underground Sacred Hall. His name was Zhao Jing. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was him who had torn off the arm of chief disciple Chen Ze of the Cangxuan Sect’s Hongya Peak. At this moment, there was still blood dripping down from his fingers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Tang Muxin, your Cangxuan Sect’s Zhou Yuan has killed two chief disciples from my Sacred Palace. If you don't hand him over today, my Sacred Palace will not leave it at that,” Huo Tian warned. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmph, I’m surprised you still have the face to say that. The fact that the chief disciples of your Sacred Palace were killed by Zhou Yuan means that they were not good enough.” Tang Muxin's beautiful eyes were biting cold with a hint of anger. “If you really want to fight, my Cangxuan Sect will accompany you. The Sacred Palace is considered to be a well-respected sect, yet you launched a sneak attack. It really is despicable.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It had still been peaceful when the two waves of people had met earlier, but Zhao Jing of the Sacred Palace had suddenly acted, and Chen Ze of the Hongya Peak had to defend in a hurry, causing his arm to be torn off.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jing grinned, revealing his white teeth. “It is said that the Hongya Peak focuses on physical training and that it is famous among the Cangxuan Heaven. However, after today I have realised that it is nothing special. Compared with our Sacred Palace, it is much inferior.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beside Tang Muxin, Hongy Peak chief disciple Chen Ze was deathly pale, and his right arm was in a twisted position. But when he heard Zhao Jing insult his Hongya Peak, his eyes suddenly turned red, and he snapped, “Do you dare to compete against me again?!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jing crossed his arms and shot him a sideways glance. “If you want to die, then I can certainly fulfill your request.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Ze was so infuriated that he tried to charge forward, but Tang Muxin stopped him. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t be impulsive,” Tang Muxin reminded. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Tian tucked one hand behind his back and said calmly, “If the two chief disciples from our Sacred Palace were really defeated in Zhou Yuan's hands, then we will naturally have nothing to say.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But according to the news we received, Zhou Yuan used a lot of despicable tricks and had secretly attacked by taking advantage of a temporary cooperation. Fan Yao was not on guard, so that boy’s sneak attack had succeeded.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Zhao Jing was only doing what that boy had done to us. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But, what makes you think that a new disciple who has just joined the Cangxuan Sect for less than two years is capable of defeating the third chief disciple of my Sacred Palace?!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were countless eyes watching, so when they heard Huo Tian, they were sure to begin whispering to one another. If Zhou Yuan had really launched a sneak attack during an alliance, then that was indeed despicable.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Muxin’s and Su Yao’s faces darkened. Huo Tian was really vicious to want to inscribe such an evil reputation onto Zhou Yuan. If this evil reputation was found to be true, then who would dare to cooperate with Zhou Yuan in the future?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Zhou Yuan is outstanding in my Cangxuan Sect. He does not need to use such methods to kill a chief disciple from your Sacred Palace.” Tang Muxin sneered.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Tian chuckled. “If so, then tell the boy to come out and show us in person.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Zhou Yuan hasn’t arrived yet. If you really want to see, you will have a chance in the future.” &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Tian shook his head, sighing, “It seems that this person not only uses unscrupulous tricks, but he is also a coward.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He turned to Chen Ze and said, “Chief disciple Chen Ze, I think you should direct the hatred for your broken arm on that Zhou Yuan instead.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Tian was intending to drive a wedge between them, but Chen Ze simply looked at Zhao Jing with an icy cold stare, ignoring his words. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It seems that you really don't want to hand over that boy.” Huo Tian sighed, but his eyes turned sinister. “Now that the matter has come to this point, someone has to give me an explanation for the death of two Sacred Palace chief disciples.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If you don't want to get other disciples involved, then both sides can send someone out to settle things here today.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huo Tian nodded at Zhao Jing, who slowly strode forward, grinning. “Which chief disciple of your Cangxuan Sect dares to come forward to try?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Muxin's pretty face turned cold, and she was about to step forward. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, chief disciple Tang Muxin, you and I are both chief disciples of our two sects. If you want to take action, then I have no choice but to accompany you. The only thing is that we have exchanged moves before, and you seem inferior.” Huo Tian grinned. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Among the five chief disciples of the Cangxuan Sect, Tang Muxin was the strongest. No one else was a match for Zhao Jing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, the Sacred Palace's purpose this time was to step on the Cangxuan Sect fiercely in front of the other forces; otherwise, there would be no way for them to explain themselves when the Chosen come.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Muxin's icy face grew colder and colder. She knew that Huo Tian had come prepared.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I'll do it.” The eyes of the Sword Cometh Peak’s chief disciple Baile Che were biting cold. The other party had already trampled on their door. If they did not fight back, the Cangxuan Sect would no doubt lose face. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although there were grudges between Baile Che and Zhou Yuan, they both represented the Cangxuan Sect and were thus bound together for good or ill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Any hatred and grudge could be dealt with later when they return to the sect. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chief disciple Xie Yan of the Thunder Prison Peak said suddenly, “That Zhao Jing is second only to Huo Tian among the ten chief disciples of the Sacred Palace. His strength mustn’t be underestimated. I have a slightly stronger source of Genesis Qi than you, second only to senior sister Tang Muxin. Let me deal with that Huo Tian.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you confident?” Snow Lotus Peak’s Su Yao asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xie Yan was silent for a moment before he answered, shaking his head, “That Zhao Jing is very dangerous. He is ranked second amongst the chief disciples of the Sacred Palace.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The others also knitted their brows in a frown. The situation at the moment was clearly that the Sacred Palace wanted to force the chief disciples to fight. Otherwise, they would directly go to war. At that time, the damage would definitely soar.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But the trouble now was that Zhao Jing was too tyrannical. Even Xie Yan didn't have much confidence in winning, and if Xie Yan were to lose the battle, it would be detrimental to the Cangxuan Sect's reputation. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was easy to deduce that in this duel, the opponents would attack without regard for the lives of others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It would be an extremely dangerous battle. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then let me try.” Xie Yan waved his hand, slowly stepping forward.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jing narrowed his eyes at Xie Yan.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhao Jing’s lips twisted in a ruthless smile as his fingers folded in a fist. A terrifying imposing manner emitted from his body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Between heaven and earth, countless gazes were cast onto this scene. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>

However, from the looks of it, chief disciple Xie Yan of the Cangxuan Sect seemed to be at a disadvantage.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under countless watchful gazes, Xie Yan stepped forward, Genesis Qi rumbling out. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, just as his Genesis Qi was about to explode, there was a sudden gust of wind howling in the sky. A beam of black light fell from the sky, landing heavily on the courtyard.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, countless exclamations of shock burst forth. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
