 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A wave of noise surged through the mountains, clearly demonstrating how shocked the many disciples were inside.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, it even spread to the highest peak.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Six powerful existences that were renowned across the entire Cangxuan Heaven, turned their attention towards the deepest part of the mountain range. They were naturally aware of the outcome of that fight. For a time, surprise flashed across the faces of sect master Qing Yang and the rest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, this is interesting.” Sect master Qing Yang chuckled, a look of appreciation in his eyes. As the sect master of the Cangxuan Sect, he was naturally felt pleased to have such an outstanding disciple in his sect.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Snow Lotus Peak master Liu Lianyi also looked in amazement at the figure in the depths of the mountain range. She soon turned to look at peak master Ling Jun and said with a skin deep smile, “Peak master Ling Jun, Sword Cometh Peak has been constantly snatching up all the most talented disciples over the years. But from what I can see, they don’t seem to amount to much? I can’t believe that the entire team was eliminated by a Saint Genesis Peak disciple.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She did not get along well with peak master Ling Jun, and was naturally not going to miss out on the chance to rub it on when Sword Cometh Peak had suffered such a huge loss.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Peak master Ling Jun nonchalantly smiled as he said, “That disciple named Zhou Yuan is truly a rarely found good seedling.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His gaze swept towards a certain direction, where the elders from Sword Cometh Peak were located. When these elders noticed his gaze, all of them lowered their heads in embarrassment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The eliminated disciples belonged to their factions after all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Peak master Ling Jun suddenly said, “It seems like my gold sash disciples lack training.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The group of elders heard his words felt their hearts shake when they heard his words. Even though they could not detect any hints of anger in peak master Ling Jun’s voice, his words were evidently voicing his displeasure.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Le Tian and gang’s performance had made peak master Ling Jun feel quite humiliated. After today’s debacle, punishment was unavoidable. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As elders of Sword Cometh Peak, they clearly understood peak master Ling Jun’s character. If Le Tian and his crew managed to finish off Zhou Yuan, even if others complained that they were ganging up on him, the peak master would ignore them. This was because he only cared about the results, and not the process.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Le Tian and his crew had lost, causing Sword Cometh Peak to lose face in the Cangxuan Sect. In peak master Ling Jun’s eyes, these disciples would undoubtedly be regarded as useless.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As they thought about the punishment that Le Tian and the rest would face, the elders could only sigh inside. Le Tian was actually an extremely talented disciple. Otherwise, there was no way he could become the number one gold sash disciple of Sword Cometh Peak. However, peak master’s opinion of him would drop drastically after today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While the entire place was in shock, Zhou Yuan gently massaged his throbbing head in the flattened valley, before he turned his indifferent gaze towards the pale Lu Xuanyin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was now the only remaining Sword Cometh Peak disciple.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she saw the indifference in Zhou Yuan’s eyes, her already pale face turned even paler. The result of the fight had hit her the hardest, leaving her in utter shock.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Never in her wildest dreams would she have imagined that all the Sword Cometh Peak disciples would be eliminated by Zhou Yuan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As she looked at the young man, who she knew in the outer mountains. The same young man who she had once never bothered to glance at. She could not believe that he had unknowingly become so powerful...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The young man from the outer mountains back then was now already beyond her reach!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You… what do you want?!” Lu Xuanyin’s voice trembled as she spoke. She was trying her best not to be intimidated by Zhou Yuan’s aura.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan made a grabbing motion with his hand, and the Heaven Yuan Brush began to grow. A sharp and icy expression suddenly filled his eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He shot forward, the sharp tip of his brush akin to a spear as it tore through the air. With unmatched ferocity, it thrust towards Lu Xuanyin’s head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A sonic boom sounded.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The snow-white brush tip rapidly enlarged in Lu Xuanyin’s eyes, causing her scalp to turn numb as she felt the murderous aura gushing towards her. She had a feeling that Zhou Yuan was truly planning on ending her life with this thrust.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Over the years, Zhou Yuan had fought tooth and claw to the top, and there was naturally a ruthless side to him. He had merely been choosing to hold it back when faced against his fellow disciple in the past. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he truly loathed Lu Xuanyin. If it wasn’t for this woman, he wouldn’t have to deal with so many problems. As such, he lost his cool, and allowed his vicious side to appear.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the face of his terrible aura, Lu Xuanyin rapidly staggered backwards in fear, seemingly forgetting to resist. It was only after the sharp force pounced towards her and left a small scar on her face, that she suddenly came to her senses and shrieked, “I admit defeat!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That snow-white brush tip containing deadly force stopped inches before her. The remnant force caused her hair to turn disheveled, making her cut an extremely sorry figure.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan calmly gripped the Heaven Yuan Brush, as he shot an icy look at Lu Xuanyin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A beam of Genesis Qi light descended from the sky, sweeping away the terrified girl.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan withdrew the brush and placed it standing beside him. There was obviously no way he would actually kill Lu Xuanyin in a place like this, as it would likely get him expelled. Thankfully, the battle today should have finally scared that woman away.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, Sword Cometh Peak had lost a great amount of face today, and would likely face some difficulties in the near future. Therefore, they would likely be unable to spare energy to cause trouble for him for the time being.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he lifted his hand, seal after seal began to fly over, landing on the back of his hand.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were a total of twenty six seals.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These were the seals donated to him by Le Tian and the other Sword Cometh Peak disciples.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With these seals, he could finally ascend one of the peaks. At the very least, he was definitely going to become a purple sash disciple.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After collecting the seals, Zhou Yuan lifted his head and looked at the other disciples around the edges of the valley. They had been observing the fight between him and Sword Cometh Peak previously.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the surrounding disciples saw Zhou Yuan’s look over, their eyes widened slightly as looks of caution and wariness appeared on their faces. They began to slowly back away, showing that they had no intention of fighting with Zhou Yuan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Evidently, seeing Zhou Yuan wipe out the entire Sword Cometh Peak team had left a deep impression in their hearts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only Su Wan from Cangxuan Peak moved forward, and landed at a spot near Zhou Yuan, and said, “I never expected you to be so capable. Can’t believe you actually managed to eliminate all the Sword Cometh Peak disciples.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan grinned at her. He had a good opinion of Su Wan. After all, he had seen earlier that she was the only one who had stepped forward to help him, although she was ultimately stopped by Wang Chen from Lightning Prision Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The ten peaks are not far from here. Want to head there together?” Asked Su Wan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan fell into thought for a moment, before he nodded with a smile. His Spirit was hurting badly. With Su Wan around, he could take this opportunity to recharge.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, the two of them decided to travel together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other disciples quickly gave way.

A giant mountain stood to their front, ten peaks rising from it like ten fingers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the bottom of each peak was a thick and heavy looking stone door.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was clear that one could ascend the peaks by passing through here. At the same time, one would finally learn what format the championship battle would take.&nbsp;</span></p>
