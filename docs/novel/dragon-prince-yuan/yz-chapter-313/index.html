 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a certain valley by the reservoir.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two beautiful figure stood facing each other, the auras surging out from their bodies clashing continuously. It felt as if thunder was rumbling in the background as giant waves rose from the reservoir, crashing into the walls of the surrounding mountains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yaoyao and Li Qingchan’s icy gazes clashed, Genesis Runes revolving around one of them, stirring the surrounding Genesis Qi, while Genesis Qi hovered above the other’s head like clouds, giving off a menacing aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan wore a bitter look on his face as he watched. It was clear that neither of the two girls was planning on letting this matter rest. Since that was the case, the only thing to do as to let them vent some of their anger first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It would probably be best for him to step in only after they had cooled down a little. Although he would likely be beaten up by the both of them, he was the one who started this after all, and hence should be the one to resolve it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan nervously watched the two girls as the atmosphere between them grew more and more intense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At a certain moment, both of their eyes narrowed slightly. An alarming wave of energy burst out from Genesis Qi and Genesis Runes a split second later, both individuals clearly about to go at it for real at any moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Stop!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right before they were about to attack, a shout sounded across the area like a clap of thunder. Next, Zhou Yuan felt a vast blanket of Genesis Qi descend from the sky, like a giant hand as it completely suppressed both Yaoyao and Li Qingchan’s Genesis Runes and Genesis Qi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan immediately lifted his head, only to see a Genesis Qi cloud descend from the sky. A beautiful woman stood atop it, lotus flower like runes flickering on edge of her long skirt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;A terrifying Genesis Qi pressure pulsed from her body, causing the reservoir waters to churn violently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan was slightly startled by the sight of this beautiful woman. From her Genesis Qi pressure, it was obvious that her identity was not simple at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Qingchan was also stunned by the sight of the beautiful woman and hastily said, “Elder Miao?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The woman was one of the elders of their Snow Lotus Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The woman called elder Miao shot a somewhat helpless glance at Li Qingchan, and began to reproach her, “I just so happen to be I’m on duty today at the Genesis reservoir, and was drawn over after feeling your killing intent earlier. What the heck is going on?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although there were quite a few scuffles between disciples in the Genesis reservoir, they were not allowed to invoke genuine killing intent. When Li Qingchan had lost her rationality due to anger earlier, the killing intent she gave off was definitely not fake, and had thus alarmed elder Miao as the on duty elder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Qingchan was the most outstanding disciples of this generation from their Snow Lotus Peak, and it would undoubtedly be a huge loss for them if she was punished due to any unfortunate incident here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As such, elder Miao immediately hurried over the moment she felt Li Qingchan’s killing intent to prevent her from making a mistake due to recklessness. Even if she was a Chosen, killing another disciple would definitely get her punished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Qingchan immediately froze up when she heard the question, gritting her teeth as she hatefully glared at Zhou Yuan. How could she possibly talk about it?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This, this guy…” She pointed at Zhou Yuan as she stammered for practically half a day, but was ultimately unable to say anything, only growing increasingly angry and embarrassed &nbsp;as she glared at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Miao suspiciously looked towards Zhou Yuan. What exactly had this kid done to anger the normally cold as an ice mountain like Li Qingchan?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under elder Miao’s gaze, an awkward look emerged on Zhou Yuan’s face as he stepped up and said, “I was indeed the one at fault, but I really did not do it on purpose. I can compensate!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Compensate?” Li Qingchan clenched her jaw even harder. How are you going to compensate? Are you going to let me see you in return?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan awkwardly scratched his head, before retrieving numerous bottles from his Universe bag that were filled with many Dragon Genesis Essence crystals. “Can I use these as compensation?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were the fruits of him and Tuntun’s labors from earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh?” Elder Miao could not help but be shocked by the sight of the Dragon Genesis Essence crystals in Zhou Yuan’s hands, because she could sense that some of them were clearly from eight hundred feet aquatic beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Zhou Yuan was merely at the second layer Alpha-Origin stage, how did he manage to hunt to many formidable aquatic beasts?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was not the only one. Even Li Qingchan was surprised for a moment, because she clearly understood how difficult it was to hunt aquatic beasts in the reservoir.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Zhou Yuan did have quite a substantial amount of Dragon Genesis Essence crystals, they were not worth much in Li Qingchan’s eyes. She owned a personal hunting ground in the reservoir, and could enter any time she wished. Ordinary Dragon Genesis Essence crystals held little allure to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, she merely swept a cold glance at Zhou Yuan. Just as she was about to speak, elder Miao suddenly arrived at her side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Miao advised in a low voice, “Qingchan, although I still do not know what has happened, you will only lose out even more of you insist on continuing.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This made Li Qingchan somewhat sullen. She was one of the ten great Chosens after all, but had ended up being completely seen by this bastard, how could she possibly swallow this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Miao said, “If I’m not wong, that girl should be Zhou Xiaoyao who recently joined the sect. Peak master white brow regards her very highly, and values her even more than Ye Ge. In fact, peaks master white brow has even promised to pass down the position of peak master to her if she comes to Spirit Rune Peak.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Qingchan looked at Yaoyao in amazement. So she was that Zhou Xiaoyao. Her mastery of Genesis Runes was indeed immeasurable. It was no wonder that peak master white brow held her in such high regard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“With her protecting Zhou Yuan, you won’t be able to achieve anything.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Qingchan gently bit into her red lips, somewhat unwilling to accept this. However, she had to admit that Zhou Xiaoyao was very strong, and would surely have a place amongst the ten great Chosens if she wanted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Miao chuckled softly and asked, “Wasn’t your initial plans obstructed by Kong Sheng and Ye Ge?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the mention of this topic, Li Qingchan felt even more sullen, feeling that everything was going wrong for her. The thousand feet aquatic beast she had her sights on was snatched away by Kong Sheng and Ye Ge, and she had even been interrupted by an intruding Zhou Yuan while she was soaking in her personal hot spring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If you can calm down, I will help you mediate.” Said elder Miao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Qingchan’s hands clenched slightly as her expression fluctuated indeterminately. In the end, she reluctantly nodded. She understood that there was no benefit for her to continue kicking up a fuss. After calming down, she knew that she could not possibly murder Zhou Yuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Miao breathed a sigh of relief. She was worried that Li Qingchan would chose to be unreasonable and make matters even worse, which would only be disadvantageous towards her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, she pulled Li Qingchan as they landed in the valley.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She looked towards Yaoyao with a smile and remarked, “No wonder peak master white brow has such a high opinion of you, you are indeed an outstanding talent.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yaoyao’s pretty face remained indifferent. She merely glanced behind elder Miao at Li Qingchan, not speaking at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan walked over at this moment and respectfully greeted elder Miao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Zhou Yuan, although I do not know why this happened, I believe that you’re not the one who has lost the most, right?” Elder Miao looked towards Zhou Yuan and smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan’s face was full of awkwardness and embarrassment. He looked towards Li Qingchan, only to see the latter biting into her lips, her bright eyes staring at him like a sword. Of course he wasn’t the one who had lost out the most...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He could only awkwardly nod his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then are you going to make up for it?” Asked elder Miao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“All I have are these Dragon Genesis Essence crystals, but they do no meet senior sister Li’s standards.” Zhou Yuan forced a smile. He too did not want to offend Li Qingchan, and it would naturally be best if they could amiably resolve this matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Miao waved her hand and said, “Never mind about the Dragon Genesis Essence crystals. I hope that you guys can help out Li Qingchan as compensation, then we can call this matter even, and no one shall ever bring it up again in the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Help?” Zhou Yuan was taken aback as he looked towards Yaoyao. A puzzled look also flitted across her clear eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Miao nodded and explained with a smile, “Qingchan’s goal is the thousand feet aquatic beast, so I hope to ask for your help.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although she was speaking to the two of them, her gaze ultimately paused on Yaoyao’s face, clearly aiming for the latter’s aid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yaoyao nonchalantly asked, “Is she unable to deal with a thousand feet aquatic beast?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Qingchan calmly explained, “I can naturally deal with a thousand feet aquatic beast, but am currently obstructed by Kong Shen and Ye Ge’s cooperation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Kong Sheng and Ye Ge?” Zhou Yuan secretly wet his lips. So the two of them were working together to exclude Li Qingchan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Miao smiled as she nodded. “That’s right. If Yaoyao can help Li Qingchan stop Ye Ge, she will have a chance to compete for the thousand feet aquatic beast.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">By this point, Yaoyao, Li Qingchan and Zhou Yuan were all aware of elder Miao’s intentions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So she planned on borrowing their power to contend against Kong Sheng and Ye Ge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yaoyao’s gaze seemed to sweep toward Li Qingchan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Qingchan was a little unable to shame with the humiliation any further, and somewhat stubborn said, “Elder Miao, I can deal with those two. Moreover, even if I lose this chance, there will still be other opportunities in the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was not willing to lower her head in front of Yaoyao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Both you and Kong Sheng and just that single step from the Divine Dwelling stage. If you yield this chance to Kong Sheng, he will be a step ahead…” Said elder Miao with a solemn expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So I hope that you will not be wilful.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Qingchan’s brows tightly knitted together. In the end, she could only grit her teeth and turn away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elder Miao turned towards Zhou Yuan and Yaoyao with a friendly expression and said, “I hope that the two of you can give me face and resolve the conflict you have with Qingchan, while taking this opportunity to turn an enemy into a friend…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan let out a bitter laugh. Elder Miao may appear kind and friendly, but she was obviously a formidable person. If they were to reject, based on elder Miao words, they would be disrespecting her as an elder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan looked towards Yaoyao and said, “I think you should be the one to decide.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How could he not know that elder Miao was only concerned about Yaoyao. As for himself, he was at best some kind of accompanying freebie. Thus, he still had to seek Yaoyao’s opinion. If she refused, Zhou Yuan would rather offend Li Qingchan than force Yaoyao to help.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, Li Qingchan’s importance was a far cry from Yaoyao’s in his eyes, and he would respect her wishes even if he ended up offending an elder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yaoyao fell silent for a brief moment, before gently tapping her jade Genesis Rune Brush on her palm. Her eyes seemed to swirl in thought as the corners of her mouth raised slightly. “We can help… but she has to ask herself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Qingchan’s eyes immediately widened, her full chest heaving slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan could not help but place his hand over his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Big sis, we’ve already reached this stage, can you not cause trouble now!</span></p>
