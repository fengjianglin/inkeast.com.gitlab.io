 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Great Zhou Empire, the great hall of the palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the great hall, Zhou Qing sat on the throne. Numerous strategic experts and powerful generals were below. At this moment, a tense atmosphere filled the entire hall.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The source of tension was due to a previous urgent report. According to the report of scouts, there had been great movements within the Great Wu Empire, and many troops from various regions had gathered around the Great Zhou’s border.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The army was exuding battle intent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In these two years, the Great Wu Empire had abandoned its previous expansion in other areas and were instead focusing on the Great Zhou’s border, creating constant conflicts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This made everyone aware that the Great Wu Empire intended to attack the Great Zhou Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And after two years of preparation, it seemed the Great Wu Empire was about to take action.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Inside the great hall, everybody, including Zhou Qing, wore solemn expressions on their faces. Although the Great Zhou’s strength had improved in recent years, compared to the Great Wu Empire, they were undoubtedly still at a disadvantage.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And most importantly, King Wu was an expert of the Divine Dwelling stage.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the battlefield, the effect that an expert of the Divine Dwelling stage could achieve was undoubtedly decisive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Qing’s strength had been restored, but he was still only at the eighth layer of the Alpha-Origin stage. Thus there was still a huge gap between him and King Wu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Qing’s heart was heavy, but he did not show it in the slightest. He peered down at the high-ranking military officers. Standing in front was Wei Canglan, whose strength had also risen to the seventh layer of the Alpha-Origin stage over the past two years.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“General, since the Great Wu intends to invade, our Great Zhou must defend,” Zhou Qing said in a low voice.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wei Canglan gave a cupped fist salute. There was a solemn expression on his face. “This subordinate will immediately rush to the border and is ready to fight at any time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was just that his eyes were flickering with worry. After all, the Great Wu was too strong. Even if the Great Zhou’s strength had increased dramatically over these years, they still might not be able to defeat them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He turned around and exchanged a glance with the slender and tall girl behind him. She was Wei Qingqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was also aware of the trace of worry in Wei Canglan’s eyes, but she could only sigh gently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your Majesty, the Great Wu is too powerful, we won’t have any advantage if we fight them head on,” a voice suddenly sounded. Wei Canglan turned around. The speaker was a black-robed man, the Black Venom King.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Black Venom King was also a little bitter. Zhou Yuan had captured him back then and had set him under his control with a spirit agreement. But in the past two years, the Black Venom King had been living comfortably in the Great Zhou. If the Great Wu intended to invade the Great Zhou, his enjoyable days could come to an end if a war were to break out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, the Black Venom King was also very clear about the power of the Great Wu. Just King Wu alone, an expert of the Divine Dwelling stage, was difficult to defeat and could easily influence the war situation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Qing indifferently darted a glance at him, saying, “Then, you mean you want my Great Zhou to surrender?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Black Venom King gave an embarrassed smile. How would he not know about the hatred between Zhou Qing and King Wu? He knew it was impossible for them to compromise, so he could only sigh bitterly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the Black Venom King did not utter a word again, his unconfident performance also affected many people, causing the great hall to become more depressed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Qing felt a sense of powerlessness rising in his heart when he saw this scene. He had tried to increase the strength of the Great Zhou as much as possible over the past years. Some puppets dug out from the Black Abyss had also become trump cards for the Great Zhou to fight against the Great Wu. But could these stop King Wu, who was at the Divine Dwelling stage?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Report!” &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In this depressing atmosphere, another urgent report came.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A soldier quickly darted into the great hall, knelt on one knee and reported, “Your Majesty, the Eagle pavilion received intelligence from the Shengzhou Continent.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Shengzhou Continent?” Zhou Qing was taken aback. He naturally knew about the Shengzhou Continent, which was entirely different from a remote place like the Cangmang Continent. It was also at the center of the Cangxuan Heaven.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the Shengzhou Continent and the Cangmang Continent were extremely far from each other. Zhou Qing did not pay attention to the happenings in the Shengzhou Continent until Zhou Yuan left the Great Zhou and joined the Cangxuan Sect. After that, he had spent considerable money on the intelligent department to collect information about the Shengzhou Continent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thinking of this, Zhou Qing’s heart suddenly beat faster. “Is there news about Yuan’er?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a sudden rush of excitement in his heart. It had been two years since Zhou Yuan had gone to the Cangxuan Sect, and during this period of time he hadn’t received any information about him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I wonder how my child is?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was said that the number of talents in the Cangxuan Sect was as many as the number of clouds. Is Yuan’er okay there?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Speak.” &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your Majesty, we have just received a message about His Highness!” the soldier quickly reported. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the people in the great hall were suddenly filled with surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wei Canglan and Wei Qingqing first looked at the soldier before exchanging a glance with each other. They both looked a little surprised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had heard that Zhou Yuan had gone to train in the Cangxuan Sect, but there had been little news about him in the past two years. They had not expected to finally hear back from him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wei Canglan thought,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His Highness Zhou Yuan is a talent, but the Cangxuan Sect is a major sect where numerous geniuses of various continents gather. I wonder how His Highness is doing? Is he still as remarkable as he was back in the Cangmang Continent?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But immediately after, he slightly shook his head. The Cangmang Continent was too small. Even if Zhou Yuan could stand out there, it did not represent that he could remain as outstanding in a major sect such as the Cangxuan Sect.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Black Venom King had a complicated look on his face when he heard the words ‘His Highness’. If it weren’t for Zhou Yuan, he most likely would still be living freely in the black abyss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There hasn’t been news about that guy for the last two years. He most likely can’t cope in the Cangxuan Sect, isn’t that right?” The Black Venom King still held a grudge against Zhou Yuan for controlling his spirit, but he rarely dared to show this to anyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The soldier spoke in a quick and excited voice, “Your Majesty, it is said there is a Mythic Utopia in the Shengzhou Continent, where numerous geniuses of the entire Cangmang Heaven, including the Cangxuan Sect, the Sacred Palace and the other major sects, would participate.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“At this Mythic Utopia, His Highness Zhou Yuan killed three Chosen of the Sacred Palace and shocked the entire Shengzhou Continent!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“After returning to the sect, His Highness was promoted and is now ranked second among the Chosen of the Cangxuan Sect!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entire hall fell quiet as these words rang out in the hall.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even Zhou Qing couldn’t remain calm, and his mouth gaped open. Although the Cangmang Continent was an extremely remote place, he also had heard that the most elite outstanding disciples in the powerful sects of the Shengzhou Continent were called Chosen.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The strength of each Chosen was at least the ninth layer of the Alpha-Origin stage!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And the Genesis Qi foundation of Chosen wasn’t something that people of the Alpha-Origin stage like them could understand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But it was reported that Zhou Yuan had killed three Chosen of the ninth layer of the Alpha-Origin Stage and that he was ranked second among the Cangxuan Sect Chosen?!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a look of astonishment, Wei Canglang looked at Wei Qingqing, whose beautiful eyes were wide with disbelief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His Highness had become a Chosen of the Cangxuan Sect? Does that mean his strength is now comparable to the ninth layer of the Alpha-Origin stage?!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wasn’t Zhou Yuan only at the Heaven Gate stage when he had left the Great Zhou Empire?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Black Venom King was also struck dumb. It was a moment later before he couldn’t help swallowing mouthfuls of saliva.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many courtiers inside the great hall were also dumbstruck for moments before they finally snapped out of the shock and came forward to offer their congratulations.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha!” Zhou Qing sprang up, bursting into laughter. Moments ago, he was dispirited because of the Great Wu, but now his face had lit up with joy. He exclaimed, “The Sacred Dragon of my Zhou family indeed isn’t inferior to any genius!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“General, go carry out the order. Even if my Great Zhou risks everything, we will fight the Great Wu till the end!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wei Canglan gave another cupped fist salute before he left with Wei Qingqing. But their steps had become much more steady, and evidently the morale had been greatly boosted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They all understood what Zhou Qing meant. They were to use the power of the Great Zhou to stall the Great Wu as long as possible.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because Zhou Yuan still needed time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan should be very close to conquering the Divine Dwelling stage. As long as they could buy some time for him, it would still be possible that the Great Zhou could defeat the Great Wu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Previously they couldn’t see the slightest hope, but the news of Zhou Yuan gave them a ray of light: they could defeat the Great Wu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking at Wei Canglan’s departing figure, Zhou Qing breathed a long sigh and then gazed into the distance with his hands clenched.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yuan’er, don’t worry, and continue to train at the Cangxuan Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Father will do everything I can to buy you more time!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Father will be waiting for you, waiting for the day you make a breakthrough in your cultivation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entire Great Zhou is waiting for that day!</span></p>
