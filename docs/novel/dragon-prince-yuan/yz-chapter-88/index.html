<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the bottom of the valley, Zhou Yuan’s eyes were filled with excitement as he stared at the gently swaying Fire Spirit Grain. Moments later, he pushed down the intense emotions in his heart and quickly walked forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He retrieved a man-sized jade pot from his Universe bag which had several Genesis Qi preservation runes inscribed upon it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Next, he retrieved a shovel and very carefully began to transfer the dirt around the Fire Spirit Grain into the jade pot. He did not dare to make any big motions, afraid that he might damage its roots.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under Zhou Yuan’s meticulous work, the soil around the Fire Spirit Grain was cleaned out. He then very carefully lifted the plant and placed it into the jade pot, before filling the rest of the pot with the dirt from before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan was already perspiring profusely by the time he was done. It felt even more exhausting than the intense battle against Qi Hao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan gazed at the Fire Spirit Grain in the pot, the plump Fire Spirit kernels on it glowing faintly. Although there was only one stalk, it could be replanted to obtain more seeds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it was said that a special method was required to grow new seeds for a Genesis Food of this rank which needed to be planted within a certain radius of the original Fire Spirit Grain. Any new seeds that left this radius would wither and die, making it unable to be harvested.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is this the Fire Spirit Grain?” Wei Qingqing and Su Youwei crowded over, their curious eyes locking onto the fiery-red plant swaying in the jade pot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan grinned and nodded. “The general’s faction has done a great service this time. When the Fire Spirit Grain matures in future, there will definitely be a share for you guys.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wei Qingqing smiled. “Then I shall give my thanks your highness first. I’ve actually never eaten a grade 4 Genesis Food before and I imagine that its effect will be rather special.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Zhou Yuan saw that Su Youwei was still fixed on the Fire Spirit Grain, he chuckled and said, “Don’t worry, you will also have a share.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Youwei blushed slightly and hastily tried to explain, “I, I was just wondering how it will taste, I don’t really need a share.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While they were conversing, the numerous factions outside the valley could not help but grow somewhat restless upon seeing Zhou Yuan collect the Fire Spirit Grain. After all, everyone knew its value. Even if not used by oneself, it could be sold for an unimaginable price. In fact, any faction that had ambition would be willing to sell off everything they had in order to purchase it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, some of the stronger practitioners began to stir as Genesis Qi rose around their bodies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the time when Zhou Yuan’s party was at its weakest. If one was able to enter, one would definitely be able to seize the treasure and run off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, while these thoughts churned in these individuals’ minds, Yaoyao’s indifferent gaze swept over from the top of the valley. With a grasp of her fair hand, a scroll appeared within it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The scroll slowly unfurled, revealing a complicated Genesis Rune. The surrounding Genesis Qi frantically began to gather towards the scroll as if drawn in by something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yaoyao’s fair hand trembled as the scroll was sent flying and a dazzling radiance soon exploded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rumble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Genesis Qi collected by the rune transformed into a black cloud. Lightning flashed within the billowing black cloud as a suffocating pressure spread.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Outside the valley, the expressions of the now restless experts immediately changed when they saw this as they cried out in horror, “Grade 4 Genesis Rune?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was definitely a grade 4 Genesis Rune or it would not give off such an alarming pressure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gaze after gaze was filled with terror as they turned towards the breathtakingly beautiful young girl in green atop the valley. No one would have ever imagined that the girl from which they could not feel even the slightest Genesis Qi undulations would have such terrifying mastery over Genesis Runes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The black cloud hung over the valley, thunder rumbling. It intimidated all of the experts from the various factions, causing them to not dare to try anything funny. They knew that the black cloud would blast them with lightning if they took even a single step forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the face of such attacks, even Heaven Gate experts would be easily struck down one by one regardless of how many were sent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the bottom of the valley, Zhou Yuan also detected the disturbance outside the valley and coldly snorted. He swiftly kept the jade pot in his Universe bag and said, “Let’s go have a look at the situation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His figure took the lead, dashing forward and eventually arriving at one side of the valley.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan’s gaze first turned towards Tuntun’s battlefield where the activity was the greatest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he was immediately startled by what he saw. Amongst the rubble, there was only ten feet left of the battle puppet python’s originally titanic body. A good half of its body had already been torn away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The only saving grace was that it was a battle puppet that was unable to feel any pain, or it would have long died to the pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, the current Tuntun resembled a cat toying with a mouse, slapping the giant battle python puppet around as if it was a ball. The battle puppet python was sent flying towards the sides of the valley time and time again, a sight that made one involuntarily shiver in fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Tuntun is really frightening!” Su Youwei could not help but utter when she was this scene. To think that the normally lazy and extremely adorable little creature would become so savage in its battle form.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The corners of Zhou Yuan’s mouth twitched. He was feeling a little insecure as he recalled the times when he had reduced the portions of Tuntun’s meals. Would he not be filled with grievance if by some chance the little beast was angered, grew big and swatted him to death with a single swipe?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Looks like I can’t cut its food portions in future.” Zhou Yuan sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">By this time, Tuntun seemed to have grown bored of playing. Black light swirled around its claws as it suddenly slashed downwards, tearing open the giant battle puppet python’s head with a piercing noise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The giant battle puppet python finally fell to the ground. Tuntun’s large claw pushed open its head, revealing a human head sized sparkling crystal. The silhouette of a giant python could be seen inside this crystal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was its beast spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tuntun stared at the beast spirit crystal, clearly desiring to devour it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Zhou Yuan saw this, he was immediately spooked out of his mind and loudly yelled, “May your mouth have mercy!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His figure quickly shot forward and landed at Tuntun’s side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tuntun jumped a little in fright and surprise due to Zhou Yuan’s sudden yell. The latter took the opportunity to swiftly dash to the beast spirit crystal and keep it into his Universe bag.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Obtaining the grade 4 python-type beast spirit had been one of his objectives for entering Blackwater. Now that it had been obtained after much difficulty, he would be truly dumbfounded if he were to allow Tuntun to swallow it. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just imagine how much time would be wasted if he had to find a second grade 4 python-type beast spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tuntun lowered its head and was immediately enraged when it saw that the beast spirit crystal had been taken by Zhou Yuan. It roared at Zhou Yuan. To think that this fellow dared to snatch away its food.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“One hundred plates of meat!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan immediately shouted In response to Tuntun’s angry roar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tuntun’s roaring stopped as its eyes seemed to flicker with thought. It began to calculate how much meat a hundred plates was worth and eventually nodded its head, indicating that it had agreed to this transaction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan breathed a sigh of relief and patted Tuntun’s paw in satisfaction. Now that the grade 4 python-type Genesis Beast spirit had been obtained, he could finally begin to cultivate the first level of the Ancestral Dragon Scripture, the Omni Python Qi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once he succeeded, his battle power would undoubtedly soar, making it difficult to find a worthy opponent amongst those of the Qi Nourishing stage.</span></p>
