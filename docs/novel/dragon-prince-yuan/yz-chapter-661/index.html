 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The competition for the other six jade discs continued for around half a day until it gradually came to an end under countless unwilling gazes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The second jade disc that was home to eight-color Divine Establishing Treasures had expectedly fallen into the hands of Sacred Palace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the Sacred Palace had previously competed with the Cangxuan Sect, which led to Zhan Taiqing being badly wounded and the death of Jin Chanzi, the Sacred Palace was still terrifying because of the existence of Jiang Taishen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He vented his rage and frustration. The ferocity of the first-ranked person on the Chosen List was displayed fully without restraint. Even if Zong Ming of the Sword Seeker Sect and Tang Xiao of the North Sea Dragon Subduing Hall joined forces to fight the Sacred Palace, they ultimately were still defeated in the hands of Jiang Taishen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And the defeated Sword Seeker Sect and North Sea Dragon Subduing Hall had no choice but to give up and turn their focus onto other jade discs. The forces that competed for the jade discs were all top sects and factions of Cangxuan Heaven, but in the face of two powerful people, they had to helplessly hand over the jade disc after a long and bitter battle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the other jade disc that held Divine Establishing Treasures, it fell into the hands of the Hundred Flowers Fairy Palace. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, this was because of the Cangxuan Sect’s contribution.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The strengths of the Hundred Flowers Fairy Palace and the Heavenly Ghost Sect were evenly matched. It was a bloody battle; many Chosen had fallen, and there were many tragically wounded on both sides. But when the Cangxuan Sect joined in, the balance between the two sides was suddenly broken.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heavenly Ghost Sect was utterly defeated in the face of the joint forces of the Cangxuan Sect and the Hundred Flowers Fairy Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The head of the Heavenly Ghost Sect Chosen was called Zhao You, and he was ranked sixth on the Chosen List of the Shengzhou Continent. He was enraged by the Cangxuan Sect’s interference, but at the same time he also understood why the Cangxuan Sect would join hands with the Hundred Flowers Fairy Palace. It was to retaliate against the Heavenly Ghost Sect for previously cooperating with the Sacred Palace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, Zhao You had no choice but to silently swallow the humiliation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But in his heart he was inevitably cursing the Sacred Palace and Jiang Taishen. The reason he chose to help Sacred Palace was because he felt the Sacred Palace was stronger and that he could borrow the power of the Sacred Palace to help him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But who would have thought that the Sacred Palace would lose to the Cangxuan Sect? The Sacred Palace couldn’t even protect themselves, so how could they support the Heavenly Ghost Sect?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the end Zhao You had no choice but to give up. The remaining Heavenly Ghost Sect Chosen also turned to compete for another jade disc.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the end, six of the seven jade discs had fallen into the hands of the six major sects. The remaining one was left to the other forces. The battle on that jade peak was a bloodbath. The Chosen of various sects fought with everything they had; in the end it was unknown just how many people had died on that peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But this was the cruelty of the Mythic Utopia. In order to compete for the great opportunity, lives were worthless, even those of Chosen.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Watching the battle on the peak of the mountain, the other six major sects, including the Cangxuan Sect, did not intervene because they knew that the other sects were in a killing frenzy. If they were to intervene, it would only lead to attacks from all sides. The gains did not make up for the losses. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finally the killings came to an end, and the result was revealed. The final winner that remained standing was a top sect called the Violet Sun Palace. Although their strength couldn’t be compared to the six major sects, it was still a well-known sect in Cangxuan Heaven.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the Violet Sun Palace became the final winner and obtained the last jade disc, it signified the battle in the Mythic Utopia had finally come to an end.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The stench of blood was permeating the air, and it had become a lot quieter than before. The various forces were like wolves after a vicious fight, filled with fatigue and crouched down licking their wounds.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Standing on the peak of the mountain, Zhou Yuan gazed at the broken mountains with an incredibly calm expression. The way of cultivation had always been riddled with innumerable battles, and one often hovered between life and death. All these years of cultivation had made his mind incredibly steady, and he wouldn’t waver so easily.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“When I return to the sect to refine and absorb the purest Genesis Qi contained in the Heavenly Punishment Saint Rune, I will be able to step into the ninth layer and reach the peak of the Alpha-Origin stage.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan exhaled a long breath. It had been nearly two years since he had come to the Cangxuan Sect. When he had first arrived, he had just stepped into the Alpha-Origin stage. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But now, he was about to reach the peak of the Alpha-Origin stage and would hopefully reach the Divine Dwelling stage very soon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he left the Cangmang Continent and came to the Shengzhou Continent, what he sought was to possess the power to counter King Wu as quickly as possible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">During this period, he did not know how many battles he had experienced, but he persisted no matter the difficulties he faced. Now, he wasn’t far from his goal. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he possessed the strength to fight King Wu, he would return to the Great Zhou and settle all grudges.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“King Wu. You broke my father’s arm, destroyed my mother’s life, occupied the territory of my Great Zhou, killed my people, and took my Sacred Dragon Destiny.” &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan gazed into the distance, scene after scene flashing through his mind. The root of all this was that King Wu had usurped the Great Zhou.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From his very first memories, the Great Zhou had always been under the oppression of the Great Wu. It lingered on with its last breath of life. His father, who once had great ambition, was suppressed by reality, and the brilliance in the eyes was gradually erased.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan knew that his father had lost the confidence to contend for supremacy with King Wu. Zhou Yuan also knew that his father must be extremely sad in the depths of his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the face of a powerful enemy he could only endure silently and put all his hope on his only son.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan’s eyelids slightly drooped, eyes flashing coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Father, don’t worry. The debt that you couldn’t collect, I will personally help you with it. I will collect everything without fail!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">King Wu, just you wait! &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This day won’t be too far away! &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Buzz! &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The air above the peak suddenly vibrated like waves. The area of disturbance widened, and even space was gradually distorted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We’ve contacted my peak master. She has located us and is currently tearing the space to form a passageway to bring us out.” Li Qingchan turned to the other disciples and said, “All disciples of the Cangxuan Sect, be ready to move!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes!” &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everybody responded in unison. Their eyes lit up with excitement. Their Cangxuan Sect had made a great harvest in their trip to the Mythic Utopia. More importantly, they had suppressed the Sacred Palace, which was simply exhilarating.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan looked around and saw that the other major sects were also communicating with the elders of their sect in the outside world. The space around them was similarly rippling. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The trip of Mythic Utopia had come to an end.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Buzz! &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The space’s rippling intensified until space suddenly tore apart, as if a fissure was forming. Majestic and boundless Genesis Qi was running through it, which stabilised the space and formed a passageway.&nbsp;</span></p>
