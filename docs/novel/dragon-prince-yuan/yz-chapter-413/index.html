 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A giant flag that towered over the red land. A pillar of light rose from the flag, radiating a halo of light that encompassed the surrounding hundred mile area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beside the flag, Zuoqiu Qingyu lazily stretched her back, displaying her enchanting curves, before listlessly looked around for the umpteenth time. Although the four overlord sects were currently fiercely competing for territory in the core region, she was not going to be a part of the struggle. She was after all still a new disciple, and solely here for experience unlike Zhou Yuan...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, the Hundred Flowers Fairy Palace elder had not dispatched her to compete in the core region, instead placing her in the outer region like Zhou Yuan. Zuoqiu Qingyu was not unhappy with this placement, because it was indeed true that she was still not strong enough to vie with the others in the core region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The area she had been tasked with was home to quite a high class vein, though it was still some ways from reaching Zhou Yuan’s. Although the vein elder Wu had sent Zhou Yuan after was substantially worse than the core region, it was definitely top tier in the outer region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As such, things were quite peaceful for Zuoqiu Qingyu, especially because she was also an enchanting little beauty from the Hundred Flowers Fairy Palace. Hence, the other factions did not approach to disturb her when they saw her stationed here alone. It was after all not worth it for them to offend an overlord sect like the Hundred Flowers Fairy Palace for a mere high class vein.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These various reasons led to the area around her being rather peaceful despite the battles that were happening all over. In fact, it was so peaceful that she was nearly about to fall asleep.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zuoqiu Qingyu when in the midst of yawning when her expression suddenly changed a little. Cupping her hands like binoculars over her eyes, she looked towards a certain spot in the distance where she had felt some faint activity.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zuoqiu Qingyu pondered for a brief moment, before her foot gently pushed off the ground, sending her body drifting forward like a phantom, as if she was walking on wind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a short few minutes, she had already appeared on one of the hills nearby. She looked towards her front, and found two figures there. However, what puzzled her was that these two individuals had no intentions of contesting for this territory with her. Instead, they were holding a bottle from which a strange fragrance wafted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rumble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Next, Zuoqiu Qingyu saw the ground begin to shake as red Heavenly Flame Lizard after lizard popped out. These lizards greedily stared at the bottles in the two individuals’ hands, and began chasing the duo in a crazed manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two individuals immediately turned and ran, a huge hoard of lizards now at their heels.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zuoqiu Qingyu was somewhat dazed as she watched. These people had come all the here not to challenge her, but to draw away the Heavenly Flame Lizards? Were they actually so kind?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So kind-hearted?” Mumbled Zuoqiu Qingyu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, she had a faint feeling that there was something amiss about this matter. After briefly contemplating about it, her figure dashed forth, quickly catching up to the two figures without them noticing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After tailing them for a while, she was finally able to piece together their motive from scraps of their conversation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She hid behind a boulder as she watched the horde of Heavenly Flame Lizards with a grave expression. These guys were planning on luring all of the lizards to Zhou Yuan’s location.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So it’s Su Duan who is behind this.” Zuoqiu Qingyu’s brows furrowed slightly. Soon after, she pushed off the ground and soared into the air top her Genesis Qi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I need to inform him as soon as possible.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From the exchange between the two, she had found out that there were others who were also luring Heavenly Flame Lizards. The scale of this operation was certainly not small, and Zhou Yuan would surely be in danger if he were to face this beast wave alone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the territory she was tasked to secure, she would just leave it here for the moment. It’s not like their Hundred Flowers Fairy Palace really cared about it anyways.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; ...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan immediately felt Zuoqiu Qingyu’s aura when she stepped into the range of his senses. He immediately stood up, confused as he watched the lovely figure dressed in green rapidly approaching from far away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan curiously asked, “Why have you come all the way here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zuoqiu Qingyu landed on the ground, her chest heaving slightly as she drew in two deep breaths, before anxiously saying, “Quick, you’ve got to leave. Su Duan is gathering Heavenly Flame Lizards from all over to create a wave of beast to send against you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan was stunned when he heard this. His frowned slightly as he recalled the individuals he had encountered earlier. He had already felt that there was something wrong with their gazes. It seems like they were scouts...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Herding Heavenly Flame Lizards? How are they doing it?” However, instead of panic, Zhou Yuan was more concerned about a certain part of her earlier words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They seemed to be holding something that was very desirable to the Heavenly Flame Lizards.” Upon seeing how relaxed Zhou Yuan was, Zuoqiu Qingyu anxiously said, “You idiot, what are you still standing around for, you’ve got to leave now!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From what she could see, Zhou Yuan was currently at the fourth layer Alpha-Origin stage, and was likely on this mission for experience like herself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Heavenly Flame Lizards were grade 4 Genesis Beasts which were no weaker than the Alpha-Origin stage. With the advantage of numbers, even a seventh layer Alpha-Origin would have no choice but to retreat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Zhou Yuan ended up trapped with nowhere to escape, things would definitely become extremely dangerous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan’s gaze flickered slightly in thought. Soon after, he began to rub his chin in an odd manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A wave of Heavenly Flame Lizards huh…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He lowered his head to look at the Heavenly Yuan Brush in his hand, to be more precise, the fifth ancient Genesis Rune that was rapidly blinking. Desire endlessly pulse from it, as if urging Zhou Yuan to hurry up and feed it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, all of the Heavenly Flame Lizards in the area had been wiped out by him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That’s why he had been troubling over how to feed this seemingly bottomless brush. If he gave up on this district to roam about and hunt, it would definitely become extremely troublesome for himself, and he may even end up clashing with the other factions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Who could have expected such a huge gift to fall from the sky just as he was beginning to mull over this problem.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although a wave of Heavenly Flame Lizards would indeed by quite an inconvenience, it was not impossible for him to deal with...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, this many lizards should be enough to satisfy the Heavenly Yuan Brush, right?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This Su Duan…” Zhou Yuan licked his lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eh?” Zuoqiu Qingyu’s bright eyes looked towards him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is truly a samaritan. I feel that he may even be my legendary fated benefactor.” Said Zhou Yuan as if deeply moved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he needed Yimu Qi, Su Duan gave him a thousand year ancient wood bracelet. When he now needed Beast Spirit Crystals for the Heavenly Yuan Brush to evolve, Su Duan had racked his brains to gather a wave of beasts for him...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With regards to someone who so whole-heated took care of his every concern, Zhou Yuan was honestly a little touched.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zuoqiu Qingyu: “......”</span></p>
