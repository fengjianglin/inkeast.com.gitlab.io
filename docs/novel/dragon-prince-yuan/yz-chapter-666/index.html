 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unlike Jiang Taishen and the disciples of the Sacred Palace who had to receive punishment, Zhou Yuan, Chu Qing and the others were greeted with a great cheerful, celebratory atmosphere when they returned to the Cangxuan Sect.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even sect master Qing Yang had brought several peak masters to greet the disciples returning from the battle. Although this fight was only amongst the young generations of the major sects and couldn’t really change anything, the Cangxuan Sect, which had been constantly suppressed by the Sacred Palace, very much needed a victory to improve morale.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Zhou Yuan and the other’s victory had undoubtedly set a goal and example. Even if the Sacred Palace was strong, they weren’t invincible. If less experienced disciples wanted to catch up to them, they naturally had to put in greater efforts and not slack off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Standing before the mountain gate, countless disciples were filled with respect as they watched the numerous people return.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In particular, when their eyes fell on Zhou Yuan, who was in front of the many disciples, the reverence in their eyes grew more intense. In the past, although Zhou Yuan’s performance in the sect was also astonishing, this happened within the sect. Moreover, compared with Chu Qing, Kong Sheng and the other Chosen, there were still some gaps between them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But nobody thought that he would progress so fast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the experience in the Mythic Utopia, Zhou Yuan would no doubt be ranked on the Chosen List, and his ranking would most likely be second only to Chu Qing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, even Kong Sheng and Li Qingchan were not confident that they could defeat Jin Chanzi. Not only had Zhou Yuan done so, he had also managed to kill him. His strength had already far exceeded that of ordinary Chosen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Zhou Yuan was said to have a very high reputation in the Saint Genesis Peak before entering the Mythic Utopia, then after this, Zhou Yuan could be said to be qualified as a leader of the Cangxuan Sect’s young generation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On a mountain peak, many disciples of the Saint Genesis Peak were gathered. They watched the many figures swoop down from the boat, and among those figures they could see Chu Qing and Zhou Yuan at the very front.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior brother Zhou Yuan has greatly increased the face of our Saint Genesis Peak.” The disciples of the Saint Genesis Peak were filled with joy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who would dare say that our Saint Genesis peak is useless after this?” a disciple said proudly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The disciples of other peaks were also present. If this was in the past, they would no doubt burst out laughing, but they did not utter a word at this moment, which was a sign of silent agreement.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Indeed, from now on the Saint Genesis Peak would not be the same as before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Standing in front of many Saint Genesis peak disciples was a beautiful young girl in green. Her hair was up in a ponytail, and she was gazing at Zhou Yuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Junior sister Mu, senior brother Zhou Yuan is getting more and more powerful. You said before that you would catch up to him. It seems that it won’t be that easy.” A disciple smiled at her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was laughter all around. It was clear that the young girl had some popularity within the Saint Genesis Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The girl was called Mu Xiaoman, a new female disciple who had joined Saint Genesis Peak right before Zhou Yuan had entered the Mythic Utopia. During these months, she had become the most famous person in the Saint Genesis peak apart from Zhou Yuan and Yaoyao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The young girl was beautiful and full of vitality. She wanted to be the best at everything but was always cheerful and bright. Therefore, in just a few months of time she had stood out as an outstanding talent, very much like Zhou Yuan back then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Listening to the crowd’s laughter, the girl tilted her head slightly and said in a serious voice, “It’s only with this goal in the Saint Genesis Peak that I have the motivation to do my best. Senior brother Zhou Yuan is so strong. It makes me feel that I made the right choice in joining the Saint Genesis Peak.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her clear eyes seemed to be always filled with battle intent, as if she was a little lion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shen Taiyuan stood with hands clasped behind his back in the front of many disciples. When he heard the voice behind him, a joyful smile spread across his wrinkled face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seemed the old ancestor had really blessed him. Their Saint Genesis Peak was originally deteriorating, but who would have thought that a glimmer of hope would appear?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Saint Genesis Peak of today was gradually beginning to rise after a number of elders had joined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, the Saint Genesis Peak had new talents including Zhou Yuan and Mu Xiaoman. It seemed that their Saint Genesis Peak wouldn’t fall behind in the future.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And all this started since Zhou Yuan had joined the Saint Genesis Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shen Taiyuan sighed, looking at Zhou Yuan’s figure in the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan had contributed greatly to the Saint Genesis Peak, whereas he was just basking in Zhou Yuan’s light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But Shen Taiyuan couldn’t help feeling a little smug; it was he who had pulled Zhou Yuan over to his side back then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How many elders were envious of him now?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">......</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the grand welcome ceremony, Zhou Yuan and the other returning disciples met with sect master Qing Yang and the other peak masters. After all these matters finished, the sun had already set.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan was exhausted when he walked out of the great hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had handed over all the Divine Establishing Treasures he had obtained from the jade disc. After all, the reason he could get the jade disc was because of the joint effort of all the Chosen. Therefore, he couldn’t keep all the treasure to himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Divine Establishing Treasures that he had handed over would be distributed by the sect master after he fully understood the situation. Therefore, Zhou Yuan wasn’t worried about not getting his share.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, he kept the Heavenly Punishment Saint Rune a secret. This matter was related to the Cangxuan Saint Stamp, and he couldn’t reveal anything.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Walking out the hall, he suddenly paused for a moment when he saw that on a cloud-covered cliff edge, Yaoyao was carrying Tuntun. As the sun descended below the horizon, a layer of rose-colored clouds shrouded her body, making her look like a fairy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Numerous male disciples also couldn’t help but cast furtive glances at her. However, Yaoyao had an equally well-known reputation as Zhou Yuan in the Cangxuan Sect, so no one dared to bother her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haven’t you gone back yet?” Zhou Yuan came forward and asked with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yaoyao had no interest in celebrations, so she had not participated in any part of the whole process. Zhou Yuan thought she had gone back to the cave dwelling alone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yaoyao noticed the exhaustion on Zhou Yuan’s face, and her eyes became a little softer. “I’m waiting for you so we can go there together.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan gazed at her flawless face. Her soft voice had seemed to have invoked an indescribable feeling in his heart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Okay, let’s go home together.” The fatigue on Zhou Yuan’s face dissipated instantly, and he revealed a bright smile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Go home...” Yaoyao was taken aback for a moment, but then her red lips curved in a shallow arc. Unknowingly, she also missed the little cave dwelling that she had lived in for two years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, she knew in her mind that the reason she missed the place wasn’t because of the cave dwelling, but because in that cave lived another person.&nbsp;</span></p>
