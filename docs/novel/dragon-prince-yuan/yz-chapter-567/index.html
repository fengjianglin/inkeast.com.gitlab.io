 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Mythic Genesis essence deposit in the mountain was fully depleted by Zhou Yuan and his team after two days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although many groups were still drawn over by the commotion over this period, no one attempted to challenge Zhou Yuan’s team like Lei Qinghai and gang had done previously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Evidently, news of the battle from two days ago had already spread, allowing all of the various factions in the area to understand that the seemingly weak chief disciple of Cangxuan Sect’s Saint Genesis Peak was in truth a ferocious individual that surpassed everyone’s imagination.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, after rationally weighing the situation, the various factions withdrew their greedy gazes, turning their sights towards other targets instead. As a result, the harvesting process went very smooth over these two days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the collection of Mythic Genesis essence was done, Zhou Yuan found himself with a surprising haul. The Mythic Genesis essence he had gathered had condensed into a Divine Establishing Treasure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eh, chief disciple Zhou Yuan has condensed a Divine Establishing Treasure?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the mountain top, the other disciples noisily swarmed over upon hearing the news, as they cast their curious gazes towards the figure at the very center.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan extended his hand at this moment. Light gathered on his palm, slowly coalescing into a round and smooth baby fist sized orb. Three different colored halos rotated above the orb, creating an exceptionally mystical sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is this a Divine Establishing Treasure?” The disciples stared at the glowing three-color orb in excitement. They could feel the Qi Dwelling in their bodies trembling with extreme desire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan chuckled in surprise as he stared at the orb in his hand. He had originally believed the Mythic Genesis essence here would not have been enough to support him till he managed to condense a Divine Establishing Treasure. Who could have expected that he would end up succeeding?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It must have been because he had grown more proficient in the latter stages, allowing him to increase his effectiveness in harvesting Mythic Genesis essence. Moreover, as someone whose Spirit was at the advanced Corporeal stage, he undoubtedly had an advantage over the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Zhou Yuan was only a little amazed by this result, and not overly happy. A three-color Divine Establishing Treasure was after all something he should be excited over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His goal was to reach a seven-color Divine Establishing Treasure after all!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even so, this was still better than nothing. What’s more, any other Divine Establishing Treasures he found could be fused with this one, creating an even higher level Divine Establishing Treasure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan grasped his hand, causing the three-color orb to disappear, and return to his Qi Dwelling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He rose to his feet and looked towards the other disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s go, the Mythic Genesis essence here has already been completely extracted. We’ll head to our next location.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Golden Genesis Qi had already begun rising from under his feet. After briefly confirming the location, he began flying towards another location on the map that should contain Mythic Genesis essence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since he now had a three-color Divine Establishing Treasure, he should be trying to raise it to the four-color level as soon as possible. According to the information from Lei Qinghai, one needed a four-color Divine Establishing Treasure in order to withstand the repulsive force in the deeper area of the six color treasure location. Without one, no one would be able to approach.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The numerous disciples excited followed, clearly already itching to condense their own Divine Establishing Treasures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Over the subsequent ten days, Zhou Yuan and his team searched four locations in succession. However, two of the locations were found to be duds, with no sign of any Mythic Genesis essence. As for the remaining two, one contained two-color Mythic Genesis essence, while the other contained three-color.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the amount of Mythic Genesis essence found was less compared to the first location. It appeared that Mythic Genesis essence was indeed quite rare in the Mythic Utopia.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, Zhou Yuan’s three-color Divine Establishing Treasure ultimately did not upgrade to the four-color level over this period… there was after all a big gap between three and four-color, a gap could not be filled even by the fusion of two three-color Divine Establishing Treasures.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Zhou Yuan was not worried. The Mythic Utopia was extremely vast, and the current district they were currently in was merely the tip of the iceberg. Even so, he was still far from fully exploring the entire area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was still much to explore in this district, and there would surely be some undiscovered places that contained Mythic Genesis essence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Over these ten days, Zhou Yuan and his group encountered several other teams that had ill intentions, making battles unavoidable. However, Zhou Yuan and his team were ultimately the ones to prevail.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since all the Chosens were currently heading to the deeper regions, there were not many individuals in the outer regions that Zhou Yuan would be wary of.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After several repeated victories, the team led by Zhou Yuan became the little overlord of this district that no one dared to challenge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, the main reason why they had so easily dominated the district was because none of the teams from the other five hegemon level sects had appeared here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The outer regions of the Mythic Utopia were far too vast, as such, the chief disciples of the various sects were likely scattered across several districts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, they would eventually meet as they pushed towards the inner regions. When that happened, numerous fights and battles were naturally unavoidable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; &nbsp; …</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A few dozen figures sent out blasts of Genesis Qi at a certain clif wall. The wall immediately exploded, causing boulders to tumble downwards. Light appeared from some of these boulders, and a figure soon dashed forward to shatter these glowing boulders, causing a fist sized rock to fly out from within.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The rock looked like a gem, and gave off a halo of light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The group collected all of these gems, before sending them to Zhou Yuan, who was vigilantly scanning the area for any signs of activity from a high point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Hongyi wiped her face and said, “This is the last batch.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were currently at the final target that had been marked out on their map. The three-color Mythic Genesis essence here had been found in the form of those gem like rocks from earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After three days of excavating, they had finally managed to completely clean out this location.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan nodded and said, “Go and distribute them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Hongyi gave a faint nod in response, and began instructing the others to distribute the gems to the disciples that had been hard at work for the past half a day. Of course, the biggest share was left for Zhou Yuan, because it was his right as the leader of their team.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan did not bother to be polite. Genesis Qi surged out from between his palms, and sucked up all the gemstones on the ground. The Genesis Qi crushed the gems, turning them to dust, as strands of three-color Qi rose from within, flowing into Zhou Yuan’s body through his palms and ultimately landing in his Qi Dwelling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The glowing three-color orb in his Qi Dwelling absorbed all of the three-color Qi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After absorbing one round of three-color Mythic Genesis essence, the colors of the Divine Establishing Treasure clearly grew even deeper. However, the fourth color Zhou Yuan was looking forward to still did not emerge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan opened his eyes and regretfully shook his head. From what he could tell, the current three-color Divine Establishing Treasure was a tiny bit away from advancing to the four-color level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it would come soon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But there was one problem. They had already searched all of the marked Mythic Genesis essence locations in this district, so if they wanted to continue, they would have to head to other districts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Swoosh!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Zhou Yuan was planning on instructing the team to prepare to set off again, the sound of rushing was suddenly heard, before he saw a figure rush over from far away and land in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was Lu Yan, who should have been standing guard in another location. However, her pretty face was currently filled with worry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What is it? Have another group of idiots come?” Zhou Yuan immediately asked upon seeing this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lu Yan hurriedly shook her head, and extended her hand, as a blood-red token rose into the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The chief disciple urgent assistance token?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The expression of the surrounding disciples changed at the sight of this blood-red token, and even Zhou Yuan’s pupils abruptly shrank as his expression turned grave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This token was the urgent assistance token of their Cangxuan Sect that only the chief disciples could use. When activated, it would immediately find the nearest Cangxuan Sect disciple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it was a very precious item that would not be used unless absolutely needed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan did not dare to tarry, he immediately grabbed the token and poured Genesis Qi into it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The token flickered, as an urgent voice sounded, “I’m the chief disciple of Spirit Rune Peak, Jin Zhang. My team was ambushed by disciples of the Sacred Palace, so we retreated and are using a Genesis Rune boundary to defend ourselves. The other side has two extremely powerful chief disciples!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thirty members of my team… have already been killed by them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The last few words were clearly filled with deep anger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">*Uproar*!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The eyes of Gu Hongyi, Zhou Tai, Lu Yan and the others instantly turned red when they heard this, while their faces turned green with rage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was their first time hearing about the deaths of their fellow disciples!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Whoever receives this distress call please assess your abilities first and act accordingly. If you guys are not strong enough, immediately find and join up with other teams. We can still hang on a little longer…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The last few words were much softer, as the light on the token slowly dimmed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan reached out and grabbed the token as he lifted his head, his expression unchanged as he looked towards the other disciples. All of them were clearly seething with rage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only now did they finally realize the cruelness inside the Mythic Utopia.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Zhou Yuan, what do we do?” Gu Hong’s bright eyes stared directly at Zhou Yuan. Although she was filled with anger, she still managed to retain some rationality. Jin Zhang had said in his message that the two chief disciples on the other side were extremely powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If they rashly went into this, they may end up making things worse instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The gazes of the other disciples also converged towards Zhou Yuan, especially the dozen or so disciples from Spirit Rune Peak. They knew that Zhou Yuan had the right to refuse this cry for help because he also needed to be responsible for the members here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The place was silent, and even the air seemed to solidify.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan looked at the token in his hand with a calm and expression as he mumbled, “The token came from the west…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a wave of his sleeve, Genesis Qi whizzed out and turned into a map. His gaze slowly moved, before coming to a stop as he pursed his lips. The token came from the same direction as the six color treasure location obtained from Lei Qinghai...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why does Sacred Palace have two chief disciples there… do they also know about the six color treasure location?” Zhou Yuan’s gaze flickered in thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He waved his hand, causing the Genesis Qi map to dissipate, before raising his head to look at the numerous disciples that were looking at him with anxious expressions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this current moment, even Gu Hongyi’s hands were tightly clenched as she stared at Zhou Yuan and waited for his decision. Although she would understand if Zhou Yuan chose not to go to their aid, it would still be quite hard to accept.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan glanced at them and chuckled. Genesis Qi rose from under his feet, and lifted him into the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What are you guys still standing around for…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s go, how can we not help our fellow disciples when they’re in trouble?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although there were often conflicts between the various peaks in the sect, once outside, all peaks ultimately belonged to the Cangxuan Sect. Zhou Yuan had a very favorable opinion of the sect, and it was a place where he had grown substantially. In his eyes, it had already become his second home after the Great Zhou Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of the Cangxuan Sect disciples that had entered the Mythic Utopia would share both glory and hardships. If Jin Zhang was allowed to be killed by Sacred Palace, it would also be a huge blow to the reputation of the Cangxuan Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sacred Palace chief disciples huh…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I do want to find out what’s so amazing about them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Yuan’s voice faintly echoed as he flew away on his Genesis Qi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The disciples on the mountain finally returned to their senses at this moment. None of them had expected Zhou Yuan to be so decisive. One must know that the Spirit Rune Peak had even set a Genesis Rune Boundary to try and stop Yaoyao last year.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Spirit Rune Peak disciples felt somewhat ashamed, but as they looked at Zhou Yuan’s back, respect unknowingly arose in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This fellow…” Gu Hongyi pursed her lips and smiled faintly, her eyes gleaming as she looked at Zhou Yuan’s back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He’s pretty handsome when he tries to act cool.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, worry soon emerged on her pretty face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These were chief disciples of the Sacred Palace after all...</span></p>
