She had abandoned her own race to follow him, but soon after he had disappeared and everyone had assumed he had died. Thus, Xiao Moxian and her unborn child had arrived at the wild universe without him. Facing the great wilderness and the covetous gaze of the saints, the burden she had to endure could be imagined.</span></p>

The Xiao Moxian of that time had been filled with happiness and perpetual joy.</span></p>

From a naïve young girl she had become an Empyrean of humanity who carried the lives of several dozen billion subjects on her shoulders, helping in propping up the fate of the human race. Such a gradual transformation left Lin Ming even more in love with her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming pulled Xiao Moxian’s hand and tightly held onto her. He gently kissed her forehead and then bent down to whisper in her ear, “With me here, everything will be fine again.”</span></p>

It was he who had faced all of this without turning back, who had faced all of this without hesitation. Leaving behind only the image of his back, he silently shouldered the responsibility, experiencing unimaginable difficulties and tribulations before finally creating a miracle and changing everything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Time and time again he had made the impossible possible, writing his own legend as he lived.</span></p>

Originally, these two women should have remained safely in the lower realms. Although they wouldn’t live overly grand lives, they would still live lives that all mortals would envy. However, they had been caught in the great stormy war between the saints and humanity and were forced to drift in desolate loneliness for thousands of years. Lin Ming felt that he had been unfair to the both of them. Secretly he firmed his resolve that these two women would never be harmed in any way again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And finally, Lin Xiaoge…</span></p>

His parents had already passed away. Although he had been at the side of his parents, protecting them until the end of their lives and finally seeing them leave with smiles on their face, Lin Xiaoge had actually never managed to see her parents one final time. This would inevitably be a regret deep in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Xiaoge, you’ve grown up…”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that time, Lin Xiaoge had been in her prime. She had a beautiful figure and the vitality of a youth. When Lin Ming had said she had grown up then, he had been referring to her physical maturity.</span></p>

Lin Xiaoge looked at Lin Ming and said, “Big Brother… do you know what happened to our parents? I have been in the wild universe all these years so I never had a chance to return to the Sky Spill Continent and see them…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming sighed.

She slowly nodded. In truth, when she asked this question she had already faintly guessed the answer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was impossible for her parents to live for such a long time…</span></p>

Even without Xiao Moxian explaining things to him he could still guess that this was his child.</span></p>

Then, he kneeled before Lin Ming and deeply bowed in obeisance.</span></p>

Then, he stretched out his hands to help Lin Huang up. With this touch, Lin Huang could feel just how strong his father was.</span></p>

It was like a hundred thousand foot tall mountain pushing down on his body.</span></p>

His forehead dripped with beads of sweat. Finally, he forcefully lifted Lin Ming’s hand and stood up.</span></p>

Lin Ming didn’t want them to suffer any tribulation or injury.</span></p>

He didn’t think that during the first time he met his father, the words his father would say to him were that he wanted to test his strength.</span></p>

Although Lin Huang was strong, up until now he had lacked fatherly love.</span></p>

Although he seemed strong on the outside, the truth was that his innermost feelings were quite fragile. Xiao Moxian hoped that after Lin Ming returned, he would take good care of Lin Huang and show him the love that he had missed.</span></p>

There was no meaning in continuing to hide who he was.</span></p>

And not just that, but in the process they also learned that Lin Ming, with his own strength, had destroyed two great saint legions. And before that he had even defeated the Legion of Famine! This left the disciples of Demon Fairy Palace roiling with jubilation!</span></p>

When Lin Ming opened up a path to the wild universe and saved humanity, he had only been at the Holy Lord realm. But now he could easily strike down Empyreans! If so, then he would surely be able to lead their Demon Fairy Palace to charge out of the Hidden Dragon Galaxy and rule the world once more!</span></p>
