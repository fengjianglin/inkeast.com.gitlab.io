 <p><span style>Chapter 1320 – The Final Pass</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>For Frost Dream to possess such talent was simply unbelievable. The hundreds of millions of people present had no idea how Frost Dream was so powerful. If a normal extreme genius was born in Divine Dream Heavenly Palace and was personally guided by Empyrean Divine Dream, they still wouldn’t be able to grow to such a degree.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Frost Dream was far too mysterious; no one knew just what secrets she was relying on to grow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Standing deep within the Immortal Melody Pure Lands, Frost Dream seemed as if she was in a completely different space and time. Even though she was standing there, it was like she was separated by the vast river of time, simply unable to be touched.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Hang Chi’s six phantoms broke into the Immortal Melody Pure Lands, water splashed into the skies. The phantoms from the three evil paths, the path of hell, the path of hungry ghosts, and the path of beasts, were all purified by these waters, their bodies instantly vanishing into nothing. As for the asura phantom that was neither good nor evil, it completely paused. Its once wild eyes lost all their light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The phantoms of the path of heaven and path of mortals still rushed towards Frost Dream. As for Frost Dream, she simply switched her tune and a completely different sound emerged, turning into a brutal Buddha-slaying song, filled with murderous intent that rushed forth, splitting apart the earth and heavens!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A terrifying killing intent filled this music, as wild and crazy as a rabid wolf!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though the spectating young elites were dozens of miles away, in the face of this murder-filled sound, all of them found it hard to withstand this pressure. It was like their bodies could collapse and their organs break apart at any moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the phantom from the path of mortals entered the Immortal Melody Pure Lands, it emitted a sound like shattering glass as it was forcefully shattered by that savage dirge!</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for the phantom from the path of heaven, it was clearly much stronger. It forcefully resisted that tremendous killing intent and shot towards Frost Dream!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Frost Dream’s expression was indifferent. As the phantom from the path of heaven rushed at Frost Dream, her hand swiped across the strings. Then, 18 strings shot out, and with a popping sound the phantom was pierced through 18 times! It emitted a painful growl before disintegrating with a loud explosion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Like this, the six phantoms were all killed off by Frost Dream!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The entire process appeared easy and simple, as if there hadn’t been any difficulties at all. Moreover, when this was accompanied by the beautiful picturesque scene of the Immortal Melody Pure Lands, it was like Frost Dream wasn’t killing these phantoms, but purifying evil.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As all of this was done, Frost Dream’s expression was calm. She still quietly played her zither as before. All of her energy was placed into playing her zither, as if nothing around her was able to influence her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had played two-thirds of the Dreamsoul Immortal Melody. After the final third, the song would be completed!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Frost Dream said that as long as the Dreamsoul Immortal Melody was completed, Hang Chi would absolutely be defeated. Many people in the audience wanted to know; just what would happen once the Dreamsoul Immortal Melody reached its end?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Does Hang Chi have some other method to stop the Dreamsoul Immortal Melody?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many people looked at Hang Chi, waiting to see if he had another final last resort.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He shouldn’t. During Hang Chi’s battle with Lin Ming, he also used the Lotus Heart Bodhi. At that time, he could be described as going all-out against Lin Ming. Now, he even used the Six Paths of Samsara, a technique that is unique to the Lotus Heart Bodhi. I fear that even if Hang Chi uses another move, he still won’t be Frost Dream’s match.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to know just what will happen when the Dreamsoul Immortal Melody is finished. Frost Dream said that once the Dreamsoul Immortal Melody was over, Hang Chi would definitely be defeated.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had to be said that when the Dreamsoul Immortal Melody wasn’t filled with a Buddha-slaying killing intent, it was extremely pleasant to listen to, just like blissful sounds from heaven. Moreover, the Immortal Melody Pure Lands that were created were as beautiful as a poem. Just looking at it was intoxicating to the senses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone wanted to experience the complete Immortal Melody Pure Lands. However, Hang Chi might not be able to persist until the Dreamsoul Immortal Melody ended.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A thousand feet away, Hang Chi’s complexion was pale. In a situation where he used the Lotus Heart Bodhi along with Downfall of the Six Paths, that created a tremendous pressure on him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After watching with his own eyes as Frost Dream’s Dreamsoul Immortal Melody began percolating with its final crescendo of killing intent, Hang Chi smiled, “I admit defeat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>These words were not loud, but they spread through the entire audience.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The audience, although they had long expected this result, were still somewhat disappointed as they listened to Hang Chi. To not be able to listen to the complete Dreamsoul Immortal Melody and see just what phenomenon would occur at the end was truly regrettable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Frost Dream is too terrifying. Hang Chi actually couldn’t persist until Frost Dream finished the Dreamsoul Immortal Melody.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Frost Dream’s strength has already far surpassed those of her generation by an unbelievable degree. I really have no idea how she managed to cultivate to this state. I hear she is only 35 years old.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>35 years. Compared to the hundred million years of life that an Empyrean lived, that was a timespan unworthy of mentioning. If it were converted to mortal terms, that wouldn’t even be a baby that was an hour old. Her future was limitless!</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the contestant area, Jun Bluemoon quietly looked at Frost Dream, deep in thought. When he and Frost Dream fought, he had also been defeated!</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time, an old voice sounded out in Jun Bluemoon’s mind. “Bluemoon, Frost Dream is no mortal. I fear that within the younger generation, there is no one that possesses the ability to defeat her. You do not need to think about it too much. Work hard and surpass Lin Ming and Hang Chi; that is the orthodox path. Those two are people you should still be able to overtake. As for Xiao Moxian, she will be extremely difficult to overcome. She is someone who is loved by destiny and her talent has also reached an incredibly high degree!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even that Dragon Fang isn’t someone you can underestimate. He may have lost to you this time, but that is because he has comprehended the Three Lives Pupils far too recently and is only able to open the state of All Existence to Void. Given enough time, even he may surpass you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This old man apparently understood a great deal about every situation. He even knew about the Three Lives Pupils.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I understand, Old Sword.” Jun Bluemoon nodded. For him to refer to someone as Old Sword, it was clearly the artifact spirit in his divine sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Like this, the Divine Realm First Martial Meeting had basically ended. There was only a single match left in the tournament – that was Frost Dream against Lin Ming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, most of the audience didn’t care for this match. After all, to them this was nothing more than a passing match for formality’s sake, not to mention that Lin Ming might not even wake up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, there were also many people hoping that this match could be fought for several moves. These people were Frost Dream’s diehard fans. They were willing to watch all of Frost Dream’s matches, even if it was a match against Lin Ming that held no suspense at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Frost Dream defeated Hang Chi, her fame had finally reached its peak!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her mysteriousness, her holiness, her beauty, as well as her formidable strength, all of that together caused the countless young elites to go berserk for her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, all of these young disciples, no matter what background they came from, could only secretly yearn for and admire Frost Dream from afar. No one was truly stupid enough to imagine they could one day obtain her favor. Frost Dream was an untouchable goddess in their hearts. They were all well aware that even if they were 10 times stronger or their background was 10 times deeper, it would still be impossible to match up to Frost Dream. The difference was simply too great.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Sister Frost Dream, have you seen? They’re going crazy outside!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the resting room of Vast Universe Empyrean Palace, Xiao Moxian spoke with exaggerated gestures. The First Martial Meeting finals had ended but people still hadn’t left Vast Universe World, in particular Frost Dream’s fanatical fans. They gathered around the resting area hoping to see her beauty once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Frost Dream only gently smiled. Towards all of these fans that were rabidly chasing after her, she had no feeling at all. She suddenly asked Xiao Moxian, “Little Sister, how is Lin Ming doing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lin Ming?” Xiao Moxian was startled. She had no idea why Frost Dream suddenly cared about Lin Ming so much. “I’m not too sure. He seems to be heavily wounded; he still hasn’t woken up in the time enchantment. Big Sister, how come you’re worried about him so much?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No reason.” Frost Dream lightly shook her head. The reason she asked about Lin Ming was only because her master Divine Dream had said to her that she must fight Lin Ming during this First Martial Meeting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And at this time, within the time enchantment, Lin Ming had already reached the final stage of his training. He had stayed here for 500 days, nearly a year and a half in total.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Lin Ming entered the time enchantment he was under 32 years of age. Now that a year and a half had passed, he was 33 years old.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whether it was an unintentional coincidence or the hand of fate at work, the age of 33 years just happened to match with the number of the 33 Layered Heavens.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One year for one Layered Heavens!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s begin…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming took a deep breath. He had now completed all of his preparations. The only step remaining was the final pass.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within his mind, he had already deduced the Divine Seal Art again and again. He was revolving all of his energy according to the Divine Seal Art. The sphere of energy within his body formed from his true essence and world power began to rapidly inflate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heretical God Tree!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hu - !</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The phantom of the Heretical God Tree appeared within Ming’s inner world. The power of thunder and fire flashed atop the crown of the tree!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thunder heavenly tribulation, fire heavenly tribulation!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming had used two types of heavenly tribulation at once, plunging them both into that sphere of energy!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The power of thunder and fire were the wildest two of the five elements. Moreover, this was thunder heavenly tribulation and fire heavenly tribulation!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sphere of energy was already extremely unstable. With the massive amount of energy contained within, if Lin Ming couldn’t control it, then his inner world would be instantly destroyed. At that time, his fate could be imagined!</span></p>
 <p><span style>But now, Lin Ming still wasn’t satisfied with the amount of energy before that explosion occurred. He even added thunder and fire heavenly tribulation to the mix!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Without a doubt, the explosion would be even fiercer. But, Lin Ming had seen the formation of a black hole, and he knew that the more energy and matter contained within that star before it erupted, the more violent the explosion would be, but at the same time, after that explosion, the gravitational suction force of the black hole that formed would be even more terrifying!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A black hole could swallow even a sun!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the power of thunder and fire was absorbed by that sphere of energy, it became increasingly unstable, as if it were about to go crazy and explode at any moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Still not enough!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming’s eyes sharpened. All of his muscles were pulled tight and great drops of sweat were running down his forehead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this stage, even the smallest error would bring him beyond redemption!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Divine Seal Art was a cultivation method created by Empyrean Divine Seal, so how could it be easy? If even someone with Lin Ming’s talent was having so much trouble, then anyone else that attempted this would simply be committing suicide.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The energy became increasingly brutal. The sphere of energy was about to lose control at any moment!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Three Essences as One!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In one breath, Lin Ming poured his astral essence and spirit essence into his inner world. Three energies gathered as one, barely neutralizing the rampant energy and forming a delicate balance. This was already the final stage and this balance would only persist for a few breaths of time. But to Lin Ming, this was more than enough.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He took a deep breath, his eyes shining like stars burning in the deep dark night. “Bloom in full, beautiful flower…”</span></p>
