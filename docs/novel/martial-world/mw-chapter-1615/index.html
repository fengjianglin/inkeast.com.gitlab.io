Luckily, she didn’t see Lin Ming these days otherwise she would have no idea how to face him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These matters also entered into Lin Ming’s ears, but he didn’t care about it at all. When he drew up the Nirvanic Tribulation Flame Symbols he hadn’t even left behind any specialized anti-forgery tiny runes. He guessed that these dark divine runic masters had the ability to crack the method by which he had drawn up the Nirvanic Tribulation Flame Symbol and they could even find top fire-attribute martial artists to simulate the effect of the heavenly tribulation flames and nirvanic flames.</span></p>

If he were to collect all of them, it was unknown just what effects there would be.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This also caused Lin Ming to increasingly anticipate the final smelting trial. He wondered; just what had the Asura Road Master left behind in the final trial?</span></p>

He instead devoted his full time and concentration to drawing up the Nirvanic Tribulation Flame Symbols.</span></p>

On the other hand, if he drew up too many things then it would instead become less valuable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Currently, Lin Ming was selling Nirvanic Tribulation Flame Symbols at a fixed price of 900,000 contribution points. And whenever he put one up for sale it would be nearly immediately grabbed up.</span></p>

By doing this, he could save a tremendous amount of time and use it to research how to transform a fifth grade divine runic symbol.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Time slowly passed. Without knowing it, three months flew by.</span></p>

But, in order to transform a fifth grade divine runic symbol he had to use up a massive amount of materials. Moreover, many of these materials were extremely precious and had to be purchased with points. On this alone, Lin Ming spent over 8 million contribution points.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From this day, there was still nine months until the treasure fair.</span></p>

With this tiny amount of wealth, wanting to win anything in grand auctions at this treasure fair would be a futile gesture.</span></p>

Otherwise if a rare material appeared that he needed but he couldn’t afford, he wouldn’t even have time for regret.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whether it was drawing up a divine runic symbol or researching how to transform a fifth grade divine runic symbol, he had to fuse the Asura Heavenly Dao Laws so it was impossible to carry on this process in a time enchantment, because time enchantments twisted the surrounding laws.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In other words, Lin Ming truly had nine months remaining.</span></p>

Otherwise, why do you think the Extreme Star Holy Lands would put forth such an astronomical reward to gather so many dark divine runic masters to crack open the Nirvanic Tribulation Flame Symbol? This is because they had been defeated in their first attempt and now with the divine runic room exploding once more, they failed again!”</span></p>

Overflow leads a team of dark divine runic masters and yet even he can’t succeed. It’s far too odd!”</span></p>

They thought that the achievements he worked so hard on would be stolen by others. But, they never imagined that such a powerful lineup of dark divine runic masters would not only fail to accomplish anything but instead blow up the entire divine runic room!</span></p>

Hehe! Don’t look down on Lin Ming just because he’s young. It’s like his inheritance comes from an entirely different branch of thought and his inheritances are different from ours. This Lin Ming has a master who has reached an incredible boundary. If his master were to ever come out then he would likely be the most revered divine runic grandmaster in the entire Asura Road. His status would be unshakable and not even an influence like the Extreme Star Holy Lands would dare to do anything to Lin Ming. I suspect that Lin Ming’s master is even fiercer than the Palace Master of Extreme Star Heavenly Palace!”</span></p>

This was because one had to have a master teaching them personally; there was no meaning in just perusing through jade slips.</span></p>

I just learnt that Lin Ming had obtained the qualifications to become a third grade divine runic master over 20 years ago, and at that time he was less than 60 years of age! Elder Xue and Elder Su had two young apprentices that participated in the same examination as Lin Ming, and the results were as different as the heavens and earth. During that examination, Lin Ming tested straight to a third grade divine runic master.”</span></p>

They wanted to crudely unravel the results of the research of others like deluded idiots and now they can’t even recoup their initial investment. These people spent a full three months preparing for this experiment and yet even though they bet everything on this attempt, the result was that it blew up in their faces!”</span></p>

Didn’t they carry on simulations before the test?” Some people asked, feeling this all too unbelievable. Overflow was not some common nobody.

But as they began the true experiment, there was a problem during the fusion of the Asura Heavenly Dao. They lost control of the process and a storm of the Asura Heavenly Dao Laws blew out, causing the divine runic symbol structure to collapse. Everything was uncontrollable after that. Not only did they lose seven or eight array formations but they even lost three to five array discs.”</span></p>

After all the costs were added together, including the array formations and array discs from the first failure, as well as all materials used during the last three months, this is the total cost! Of course, 800 million is only a number that my friend estimated, but it shouldn’t be too far off. And, these points weren’t just paid for by the Extreme Star Holy Lands. Overflow also put forth a considerable amount of materials and most of the shattered array discs were his.”</span></p>

The reason is that the inheritance of the creator is far too special… they simply cannot understand it…”</span></p>

Even so, she hadn’t heard any news. The reason for this was likely not because they were hiding anything from her but because the matter was far too large and involved the one in charge of leading this mission. All of this led to a chaotic situation within headquarters and now no one had time to bother with contacting her.</span></p>
