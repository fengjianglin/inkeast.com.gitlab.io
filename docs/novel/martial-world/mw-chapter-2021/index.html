He had suffered tremendous wounds from the energy fluctuations and numerous bones had been fractured through his body. His organs had been damaged in countless places and a bloody wound was exposed on his chest. That explosion had done astonishing damage to him.</span></p>

Luckily, her figure was small and petite and the area she needed to protect was much smaller than Highsun, thus her wounds were also slightly less. Her face was blushed with a strange red color; she had clearly needed to use the power of her blood vitality to resist that explosion just now and the consumption had been incredible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This… just what is this…”</span></p>

At this time, the Legion of Famine still stood in front of her!</span></p>

Since they were located in the center of the array formation it had been equal to standing in the eye of the storm, making it so that they didn’t suffer any impact of the attack at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was also reasonable.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“For this attack they actually underwent body metamorphosis…”</span></p>

Her original plan was to send out a probing strike to see what cards this opponent had in their hands before she considered having the Legion of Famine do so. But now, as Fairy Blue Lotus expected, this mysterious person truly did have a card in their hands, and this card caused all the courage she had to crack apart!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Take over control of the Legion of Famine? How was that even possible!? The Legion of Famine was a force that was under the direct control of the Good Fortune Saint Sovereign. Besides the Good Fortune Saint Sovereign there should be no one capable of erasing their will and directly commanding them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For instance, although Fairy Blue Lotus could order around the Legion of Famine, this was all because the Good Fortune Saint Sovereign had granted her certain military authorities. Fairy Blue Lotus commanding the Legion of Famine was no different from a mortal general commanding soldiers; each one would have their own thoughts in the battlefield and there might even be some soldiers that didn’t listen to orders in war and tried to escape or even betray their people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But now, the Legion of Famine that was controlled by this mysterious person was clearly not in such a situation.</span></p>

Each of these 60,000 martial artists had blood red eyes that were filled with killing intent; they had lost all brightness and clarity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without a doubt, the Legion of Famine had been thoroughly controlled by this person and had lost their will. They were now nothing but puppets. If this mysterious person wanted them all to commit suicide then they wouldn’t even blink in doing so!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To be able to control the Legion of Famine and also have incomparably formidable strength, just who could he be?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You… are you a man, or are you an abyssal?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fairy Blue Lotus coldly asked. Her question caused the hairs all over Highsun and Darkmoon to rise. They certainly knew about the existence of abyssals. But as for what the origins of the abyssals were or what their secrets were, they didn’t know. All they knew was that the abyssals were mind-bogglingly powerful life forms filled with mysteries. They were also the natural enemies of all intelligent life in the 33 Heavens. This knowledge left them shivering with fear.</span></p>

Moreover, just from looking at them it was impossible to find any flaws.</span></p>

Even within the densest fog, this woman was still capable of making the most reasonable judgment. This was the ability that a truly qualified commander should have. If she faced a normal opponent then she would have been able to easily accomplish her mission.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unfortunately, her match was Lin Ming. Everything that was reasonable speculations in her eye was in truth all wrong.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My spear and also the Black Dragon, it seems none of this arouses her suspicious. Looks like Soaring Feather God King believes that I have died…”</span></p>

He had used unimaginable tricks of the world of consciousness to accomplish this and fool Soaring Feather God King into thinking he had died.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was because the Soul Emperor also didn’t want him to be found by the Soaring Feather God King. If so, then Soaring Feather God King would see that his Eternal Soul had been seized and all his strength had been wasted away as a result. If this occurred, then that would arouse the suspicions of the Good Fortune Saint Sovereign.</span></p>

Not even Lin Ming could find any clues about it.</span></p>

With a slight movement his figure vanished!</span></p>

They rapidly drew backwards, their first thought being that Lin Ming was attacking them.</span></p>

His figure teleported 10,000 miles away. Within the deep starry skies, his fist came smashing out!</span></p>

His plan had been to make it appear that he had been turned into dust in that giant explosion and then escape through a space distortion. Such an amateur method was easily seen through by Lin Ming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, the moment after the large explosion occurred, Lin Ming had already spread out his divine sense and locked onto every survivor.</span></p>

Luckily for him, this move allowed him to escape this calamity.</span></p>

Otherwise it would be difficult to implement the plan he had come up with. At the very least, the Good Fortune Saint Son wouldn’t dare to bring the avatar of Famine to challenge him.</span></p>

Now, beneath Lin Ming’s hands, he was being played around with like putty, being pinched like dough.</span></p>
