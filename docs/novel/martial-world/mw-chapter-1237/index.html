 <p><span style>Chapter 1237 – The Battle Begins</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the first 21 steps of the Divine Seal Altar, one would fight simulation spirit bodies produced by array formations. Starting from the 22</span><span style>nd</span><span style> step and upwards, one would no longer fight simulation spirit bodies but would have to fight and defeat other participants on the same step!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This produced another problem. That was that the first group which was in the lead was stronger overall, thus the opponents they faced were also more powerful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, if they wished to maintain their status of being in the vanguard, they would have to pay a certain price.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If they were too weak they would be defeated and their ranking here would drop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A participant was only able to lose five times before they were eliminated; they naturally didn’t wish to waste these chances.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As some people realized this, they began to slow down their pace. If they instantly rushed to the 22</span><span style>nd</span><span style> step and had to directly face Nether Limitless, then that truly wouldn’t be fun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In fact, only a very small minority of people were able to climb up to the 22</span><span style>nd</span><span style> step.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After such a long time with people continually being eliminated, out of the original 300,000 participants, there was not even a hundred thousand left. But, out of these remaining participants, the overwhelming majority would find it impossible to reach the 22</span><span style>nd</span><span style> step; they would be eliminated before then.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no doubt that if one could not reach the 22</span><span style>nd</span><span style> step then they would not pass the semifinals.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sun fell down over the horizon and the curtain of night rose high up into the skies. The semifinals had now been going on for two days!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two days, 48 hours, this time period was an extremely great test on every participant’s mental state, physical strength, and endurance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A massive number of participants weren’t able to withstand the Empyrean pressure, or they weren’t able to defeat the spirit bodies, or they might have even exhausted themselves. But no matter what, if any of these happened, the participant was eliminated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The disparity grew despairingly large!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The hundred thousand plus participants were like ants crawling up a hill, sparsely distributed all over two sides of the Divine Seal Altar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As some people were still struggling to reach the 11</span><span style>th</span><span style> step, Nether Limitless had already defeated the spirit body of the 21</span><span style>st</span><span style> step and was beginning to climb to the 22</span><span style>nd</span><span style> level!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nether Limitless had defeated all spirit bodies of the first 21 steps with relative ease.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No one was surprised by these results. This entire way he had killed all the spirit bodies with unstoppable momentum.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The disciples of the Skydark Holy Lands became increasingly wild and crazy as they shouted out Nether Limitless’s name. The entire arena seemed to echo with the name of ‘Nether Limitless’.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And on the Ancient Phoenix Clan’s side, the disciples were relatively muted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Ancient Phoenix Clan wasn’t in too good of a situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Ancient Phoenix Clan, with Lin Ming included, had a total of four disciples entering the semifinals. The weakest of them had already been eliminated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Ping’s situation wasn’t looking too good.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whether he could reach the 22</span><span style>nd</span><span style> step was questionable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for those that would likely reach the 22</span><span style>nd</span><span style> step, they were Lin Ming and Yan Littlemoon. But, the truly brutal part of this competition would finally begin upon stepping onto the 22</span><span style>nd</span><span style> step, because at that time, they would have to duel and defeat other participants. That was the true test of strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the 21</span><span style>st</span><span style> step to the 22</span><span style>nd</span><span style> step, Nether Limitless’s climbing speed wasn’t slow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Without accident, he was the first one to reach the 22</span><span style>nd</span><span style> step!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After mounting the 22</span><span style>nd</span><span style> step, Nether Limitless stood proudly on the flat plains, waiting for other participants to reach him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He held his katana as he stood against the wind, the aura of a ruler wreathing him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In that moment, because of Nether Limitless’s existence, many of the other martial artists felt a great pressure on them. They faintly didn’t dare to climb up, because climbing up to the 22</span><span style>nd</span><span style> step was the same as facing Nether Limitless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nether Limitless has already stepped upon the 22</span><span style>nd</span><span style> step, he alone is deterring all other participants… oh! Someone else has climbed up! That is Bloodless Sword!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The twin hosts loudly shouted. Because the current position of the competition was too high up on the Divine Seal Altar, they had ridden a spirit boat up so that the entire audience could clearly see them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bloodless Sword was only a bit behind Nether Limitless. After Nether Limitless reached the 22</span><span style>nd</span><span style> step, Bloodless Sword was right behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two stood a thousand feet apart, in sharp contrast to each other, neither of them willing to give an inch!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The entire audience felt their breath catch in their throats!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Would it be a battle between kings at the very start! This was simply too amazing!</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, after some time passed, the two still didn’t fight. They simply stood there, waiting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems… they aren’t planning on fighting so early. The two of them aren’t idiots. Even if Nether Limitless can defeat Bloodless Sword, he will have to pay a great price to do so. It will affect how far he can go afterwards.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. The 22</span><span style>nd</span><span style> step should not be the stage of their battle.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was clear that Nether Limitless and Bloodless Sword took each other as strong rivals in these semifinals. If the two fought, it would have to be at the 30</span><span style>th</span><span style> step or above.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, a third person finally reached the 22</span><span style>nd</span><span style> step.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This person was a purple-clothed swordsman; his nickname was Purple Blade. He was ranked in the top 300 of the Divine Seal Decree and also first on his own great world!</span></p>
 <p><span style>To be able to be the third to climb to the Divine Seal Altar’s 22</span><span style>nd</span><span style> step, that was enough to prove his strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With Purple Blade’s arrival, Bloodless Sword and Nether Limitless still remained unmoving.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They continued to wait.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slowly, over time, the others gained courage and more and more people climbed up to the 22</span><span style>nd</span><span style> step.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, there was a 1000 foot null zone around Bloodless Sword and Nether Limitless that no one dared to stand in, lest they find themselves targeted as opponents.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In this way, six hours passed. Several thousand participants had already reached the 22</span><span style>nd</span><span style> level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, no one fought!</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the powerhouses stopped here, seeming to unanimously agree to restore their strength on the 22</span><span style>nd</span><span style> level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They waited for more people and weaker people to climb up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The 22</span><span style>nd</span><span style> level was where the strong would hunt the weak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And at this time, Lin Ming also climbed towards the 22nd step.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mixed within the martial artists here, no one would notice him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The truth was that starting from the tenth step, Lin Ming was able to confirm that someone was targeting him. However, this mysterious existence didn’t push things too far. These spirit bodies always excelled in some area and were able to create a bit of trouble for him. However, truly slaying these spirit bodies didn’t consume too much of Lin Ming’s strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Generally speaking, these weren’t deliberate obstacles but rather probing moves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To probe his bottom line. To probe his talent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This caused Lin Ming to be increasingly confused. Just what great expert would target him here?</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the start until now, his performance had been only satisfactory at best. Whoever this mysterious figure was, they should have been watching Nether Limitless instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming’s pace was steady, neither fast nor slow. He finally stepped onto the 22</span><span style>nd</span><span style> step with the third group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are quite a number of people here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Lin Ming climbed up to the 22</span><span style>nd</span><span style> step he hadn’t been able to see what was happening on the step itself. But now that he looked around, he saw around 4000-5000 people. Casually choosing any of them, one could see they were peak powerhouses. Many of them were near the same level as Wu Finalcloud.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were truly countless masters all around. Those that could climb up to the 22</span><span style>nd</span><span style> step were extreme elites that could close their eyes and become Holy Lord level characters in the future.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These people had carefully chosen where they would stand. Basically, nearly no one stood around those that felt strong in fear of bringing disaster upon themselves. As for those that felt weak, there were many people crowded near them. Everyone was thinking of pinching these weak persimmon-like people to pieces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Lin Ming stood on the 22</span><span style>nd</span><span style> step, three people calmly and quietly walked towards him, discreetly surrounding him. Among them, a tall martial artist shaped like a bamboo pole smiled at Lin Ming. However, his smile harbored ill intent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They judged whether or not someone was weak with two criteria. First was how they felt about this person, and second was how long it took them to climb up to the 22</span><span style>nd</span><span style> level. The later one climbed up, the weaker one was assumed to be.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although this type of judgment wasn’t necessarily accurate, it was still better than randomly guessing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After all, nearly all the martial artists present had extremely solid foundations and the Law fluctuations around them were vivid. Moreover, many of these people were hiding their aura so it was difficult for others to judge them based on that alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Long, Brother Fei, it's quite rare for a little early Divine Sea brat to appear here. How about you let me handle him?” The thin martial artist who was smiling at Lin Ming said to the other two people around him with a true essence sound transmission.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, even if he’s at the early Divine Sea, he might not be weak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I certainly understand this, but in equal conditions, wouldn’t it always be easier to deal with someone with a low cultivation than a higher cultivation? Brother Long, Brother Fei, you’re both so strong and this little brother here is so weak. Now that there is actually an opponent who showed up that climbed so slowly and also has a low cultivation, won’t you look after this little brother of yours?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In order for the thin martial artist to be the one to challenge Lin Ming, he flattered again and again. He simply didn’t know who Lin Ming was. Although the twin hosts had introduced Lin Ming, the participants had all been busy crawling up the Divine Seal Altar at the time. Although they heard of him, they didn’t have an image of him in mind. Even Nether Limitless and Bloodless Sword didn’t know who Lin Ming was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior-apprentice Brother Lin is being targeted.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Ancient Phoenix Clan’s disciples were all watching Lin Ming. Currently, Lin Ming was the only person of the Ancient Phoenix Clan who had reached the 22</span><span style>nd</span><span style> step.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for Yan Littlemoon and Xiao Ping, they were still hard at work climbing up the 20</span><span style>th</span><span style> step.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Humph, they actually think that our Senior-apprentice Brother Lin is easy to bully! I wonder just how strong he is…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of the participants that were able to reach the 22</span><span style>nd</span><span style> step, none of them could be underestimated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“These people think I’m some fat sheep or something.” Lin Ming faintly smiled. “My climbing is relatively slow and my cultivation is also at the early Divine Sea; it’s not strange that I’m being targeted. My cultivation is the lowest of the participants here. This is also good. I was worried that I would have to spend some time looking for an opponent, but now someone delivered themselves straight to me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming grinned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the thin martial artist saw Lin Ming’s happy expression, he frowned. Why was this boy smiling?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as he was thinking this, the sound of exploding energy erupted from the far off distance, following by a pitiful scream. Some people had already begun fighting!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first one to attack was Nether Limitless!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Using the Space Laws, Nether Limitless instantly crossed 100,000 feet, actually arriving right in front of the person furthest from him! With his personality, he instead decided to fight the one furthest from him!</span></p>
 <p><span style>That person was immediately frightened out of his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as that person was about to raise his weapon, Nether Limitless’s katana had already cut out, slashing through his protective true essence.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>That person’s protective true essence shattered and he was sent flying backwards, vomiting blood!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nether Limitless had kept his hand. This was the real world and those that died would not revive somewhere else. However, the rules of this grand competition forbid intentional murder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The martial artist who was struck backwards was wrapped up in a layer of purple energy before he even landed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This purple energy rapidly healed the martial artist’s wounds. At the same time, it also brought him hurtling downwards to the 21</span><span style>st</span><span style> level!</span></p>
 <p><span style>If one lost, they would have to fall down one step!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nether Limitless’s attack had become a signal. At this time, a massive number of participants struck out with their attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The battle had begun!</span></p>
