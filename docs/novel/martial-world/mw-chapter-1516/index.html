Taking advantage of his weakened state, Lin Ming stepped forwards, slashing out the Phoenix Blood Spear to take Naqi’s head!</span></p>

If the Imperial Prince died then it would be because of his protection being flawed. Once he returned to the saint race he would suffer extreme penalties.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You dare to injure the Imperial Prince of my people? I’ll take your life!” Manyu grabbed a saber and cut out at Lin Ming’s waist, wanting to use this attack to force him back.</span></p>

This stone gate was as stable and still as a mountain, completely blocking Manyu’s saber strike!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Kacha!</span></p>

The stone gate only trembled a little but not a single mark was left behind.</span></p>

The stone gate howled out, suppressing Manyu!</span></p>

Lin Ming’s strength had far exceeded his imagination! By himself, he actually faced all of them together and had taken the upper hand! Although it could be said that Lin Ming took advantage to sneak attack them the moment they were all focused on dealing with the 108 iron-armored spectral soldiers, for him to accomplish this was nearly unbelievable. After all, he only had an early Divine Lord cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Manyu didn’t have time to think about how Lin Ming broke into the Divine Lord realm in just a few years; he had to face off against this incomparably heavy Primordius Gate. This area was an absolute killing zone. Although Lin Ming was able to recklessly dash about, Manyu definitely didn’t have the courage to do so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He slashed out several hundred saber lights, all of the saber lights crashing onto the Primordius Gate and releasing a dazzling explosion. At the same time he roared out loud and used his fists to punch against the Primordius Gate. He wanted to use his powerful saint race body to forcefully resist the Primordius Gate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His entire body swelled with blood vitality, some of it even leaking out the corners of his mouth. He turned around and what he saw left his body icy cold. Lin Ming had already arrived in front of Naqi. Naqi’s face was pale. Right now, his life hung on the thinnest thread!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming’s attack was merciless. With a sharp thrust of his hand, the Phoenix Blood Spear whistled forth, howling towards Naqi like a raging red dragon!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As long as this spear struck, Naqi would die without a burial ground!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But as soon as the Phoenix Blood Spear was about to strike Naqi, a gray rope whipped outwards and wrapped around Naqi, immediately carrying him away!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span></p>

The space barrier trembled and divine light shot out, but the space barrier didn’t even have the tiniest crack. This was the space barrier that held Bai Qi’s grave; not even a Great World King was able to break through it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Just a little bit more!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming darkly sighed in regret. Just a little more and he would have killed Naqi!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he turned around, he saw Naqi wrapped in the gray rope and shooting towards a gray-robed man. Naqi entered his inner world, vanishing from sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This gray-robed man was that mysterious Mister Ash Murder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So you are Lin Ming! To think that you would ambush us here. You little beast, I will take your life!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ash Murder was so angry that his insides were gurgling within him, seething with rage! Lin Ming had chosen the time when his concentration was completely focused on other matters to sneak attack him. Before this, he didn’t even know that Lin Ming had been hiding here. Lin Ming’s sudden appearance had left Ash Murder startled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The battle array that Imperial Prince Naqi and the others formed had been shattered by Lin Ming, and the two puppets were also crushed apart by him. Not just that, but Lin Ming had made him lose his concentration in order to save Naqi. This caused the pressure of those 108 puppets to be even greater on him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This brat was already long waiting in ambush here. He was waiting for us to break out of the array formation before he sneak attacked us!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ash Murder wasn’t an idiot; he was able to immediately understand what was happening. A junior that was only several dozen years old was able to freely move within a danger zone of God Burying Ridge, a place where even World Kings could perish. Not just that, but he was able to keep guard in this ancient array formation and ambush a half-step Empyrean!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This boldness and these methods caused even Ash Murder to feel a cold chill run down his spine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming glanced at Ash Murder and simply didn’t bother him with. He turned around and immediately attacked Manyu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Ash Murder had invested all of his strength into sealing away the 108 iron-armored spectral soldiers and was unable to divert his attention, he still possessed a half-step Empyrean cultivation and likely had many terrifying abilities. Lin Ming found it hard to contend with an ordinary World King right now. If he approached Ash Murder, a simple strike would severely wound him or even kill him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The most intelligent plan would be to wait until Ash Murder was completely exhausted by the iron-armored spectral soldiers, and then Lin Ming could wait for a chance to deal with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brat, you really do not know the meaning of death or danger!” Manyu was already enraged by Lin Ming. He had been caught off guard by Lin Ming’s sneak attack and now that he saw Lin Ming continue to attack him, he roared out loud, grasped his saber and slashed out at Lin Ming!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of his strength was poured into this saber strike without any held back! He had already seen Lin Ming’s strength with his own eyes, but he didn’t believe that Lin Ming had the strength to kill a half-step World King in frontal combat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A saber cut out, the saber light piercing through the dark like a bolt of lightning. At this time, the Phoenix Blood Spear was still covered with the interwoven power of thunder and fire, but it was different from the previous red and purple spear light. This time, Lin Ming’s spear also contained a gray light, one that seemed to swallow all of existence!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This gray light was concealed in the spear light, seeming common and humble, something that no one would notice. After all, it wasn’t strange for a martial artist’s attack to cause an eruption of multi-colored lights. These lights were the colors of the various Laws.</span></p>

In that collision just now, Lin Ming had been forced back and Manyu had only shaken a bit. This allowed Ash Murder to let out a breath of relief. As long as Manyu could suppress Lin Ming, then all he had to do was seal away these iron-armored spectral soldiers. Once he did so, killing Lin Ming was only a matter of time.</span></p>

Most soul attacks used one’s own soul as the weapon, and if the attack failed, one would receive a backlash to the soul. But, Empyrean Divine Mist’s soul attacks could actually use energy to directly strike an opponent’s soul, without any need for using one’s own soul as the attack medium.</span></p>

His blue wolf wasn’t strong. Although the blue wolf was an ancient vicious beast, ancient vicious beasts normally grew at a slower pace than the mortal races. He had tamed the blue wolf far too early and although Ash Murder was at the half-step Empyrean realm, the blue wolf was only equal to a mid to late Saint Transformation realm martial artist. At this point, the blue wolf was no longer able to provide much help to Ash Murder, but Ash Murder had always felt an extremely deep sentimentality towards this contract beast that he had raised for hundreds of thousands of years. Now, this contract beast of his had been killed by Lin Ming’s spear strike. How he could not hate!?</span></p>
