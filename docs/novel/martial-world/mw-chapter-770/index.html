 <p><span style>Chapter 770 – Opening the Universe Melting Furnace</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Li Yifeng saw Zhou Kun’s depressed appearance, he didn’t relish it at all. Instead, all he felt was pity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But near Li Yifeng, Qing’er muttered in soft voice, “If you can’t afford the game then don’t play, this idiot has really left me speechless.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guru Blueway shook his head and said, “Sir Zhou, you shouldn’t play in the ancient jade carving trade. Although wood spirit jade has the effect of nourishing the soul, the high price far outstrips its use. Generally speaking, it simply isn’t the proper way to go about things. Although this pair of bracelets is simply an imitation, corpse jade is still quite valuable. It should be able to sell for 4000 to 5000 spirit essence stones at an auction house. It would be wiser if Sir Zhou were to sell them off and use the money to practice in serenity.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>4000 to 5000 spirit essence stones… that was a full 10,000 less essence stones than what Zhou Kun had bid for these jade bracelets. Zhou Kun was truly unwilling to sell these corpse jade bracelets and withdraw from the ancient jade carving trade.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The greater the hope, the greater the disappointment. The loss of the blood spirit jade bracelets had been a tremendous attack on Zhou Kun’s psyche.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Yifeng shrugged and said to Lin Ming, “Brother Lin, those three items you bought should be real. Do you plan on selling them to buy more wood spirit jade?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming nodded, “Yes, I need a great deal of wood spirit jade.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then we should have Grandmaster Blueway apprise them! With a grandmaster’s appraisal they will be far easier to sell at a higher price.” Li Yifeng rubbed his hands in excitement. He certainly didn’t want to miss a chance to open his eyes like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Lin Ming actually shook his head and said, “No, I want to directly place them in the auction house and have the appraisal masters look at them. I don’t wish to arouse any unnecessary interest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming had already been banned from White Dragon Jade Row; from now on, he could forget about stepping into any other White Dragon Jade Row branch store. He didn’t want to make a name for himself and ruin his method of acquiring money. In the ancient jade carving business, news travelled far too fast.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Yifeng felt a bit regretful in his heart. But, since this was what Lin Ming decided, he naturally had no complaints, “Brother Lin, if you trust me then I can help you handle those three items and completely change them into spirit essence stones for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you Brother Li.” Lin Ming couldn’t ask for a better solution. He was pressed for time and didn’t have much energy left over to deal with these trivial matters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…..</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Yifeng was extremely efficient. In a mere 10 days, all three items had been completely changed into spirit essence stones. After removing the cut that the auction house took, there was a total of 22,000 spirit essence stones. And at this time, Lin Ming had already arrived at the largest city in the Thatch Region – Jade City.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The buildings in Jade City were all built from large chunks of rocks, and these rocks hadn’t been carved or polished much either. There was a very distinctive barbaric and wild taste to the city.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Behind Jade City was a 10,000 foot high perilous mountain peak named the Jade Mountain. Lin Ming’s current dwelling was located here. Cut out of this perilous mountain were several hundred cave mansions. Every cave mansion could be used to close up in training and the origin energy here was also very rich. One could rent a vacancy as long as they had enough spirit essence stones.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming rented a medium-sized cave mansion for three years.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming didn’t care about the origin energy in the cave mansion. What he cared about was the security here. According to Li Yifeng, there was a Divine Sea Supreme Elder personally guarding Jade City; no one dared to come here to cause trouble. If he closed up here he could do so in peace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time, Lin Ming was sitting down on a stone bed in his cave mansion and had a small, three foot high furnace in front of him. Carved on the surface of the pill furnace was a circle of heaven that contained all the myriad creatures of the universe. At the very center of this design was a red Golden Crow image.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This furnace was the Cosmic Melting Furnace. The Cosmic Melting Furnace used to be the top divine furnace of the Sky Spill Continent several tens of thousands of years ago. Even an Emperor powerhouse could be refined within it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Currently, Lin Ming had laid down eight blazing flame columns. Every flaming column had a statue of a carved horned dragon within it, and these eight horned dragons were all aimed at the Cosmic Melting Furnace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming, with the help of Demonshine, had reformed the Eight Dragon Jade Dawn Array that the Demon Emperor had once arranged around the Cosmic Melting Furnace. On this day, he planned on completely opening the Cosmic Melting Furnace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past, Lin Ming had only been able to open the first level of space of the Cosmic Melting Furnace. But according to Demonshine, the Cosmic Melting Furnace had a total of three different levels. Since Lin Ming now planned on officially using the Cosmic Melting Furnace, it was necessary for him to open all three spaces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming lifted his hand and formed a seal. Waves of burnished dawn light began to spout out from the mouths of the horned dragons, covering the pill furnace and causing a burning hot flame to instantly burn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Open!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming shouted loudly. On the surface of the Cosmic Melting Furnace, brilliant rays of golden light suddenly began emitting from the Golden Crow image. For a time, it was like a sun had risen within the room, blinding all eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Cosmic Melting Furnace fiercely shook, and a high-pitched dragon roar seemed to issue out from the furnace. The sound waves flushed into the sound-insulating enchantment of the room, causing the entire place to shake as if it could collapse at any moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, a fist-sized fruit and a golden red root flew out from the Cosmic Melting Furnace and were immediately grabbed by Lin Ming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had finally opened the second level of the Cosmic Melting Furnace!</span></p>
 <p><span style>With Lin Ming’s current strength, opening the second level of the Cosmic Melting Furnace wasn’t difficult at all. What would be difficult was opening the third level. The Eight Dragon Jade Dawn Array had been prepared especially for that purpose.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A Five Color Fruit and Void Temper Root! Hehe, boy, you’ve made it rich again!” Demonshine’s voice sounded out in Lin Ming’s mind. There were treasures in every level of the Cosmic Melting Furnace. When he had opened the first level of space, Giant Demon blood and a Nameless Divine Pill refined with a Nirvana Dragon Root had popped out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The blood of the Giant Demon had been absorbed by the Magic Cube. As for that Nameless Divine Pill, Lin Ming had swallowed it when he had been trapped in the King’s Cage and was struggling to find a way out. The Nameless Divine Pill had fused together with the Asura force field, and together with the collision from a Demon God Bone, it had allowed him to completely break through the first gate of the Eight Inner Hidden Gates.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now, the Five Color Fruit and Void Temper Root that Demonshine spoke of were the treasures from the Cosmic Melting Furnace’s second level of space.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for what the treasures in the Cosmic Melting Furnace had been, even Demonshine hadn’t been sure. Lin Ming could only search through the soul fragment of the Demon Emperor to find incomplete clues.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I remember from the Realm of the Gods alchemist’s memories that Five Color Fruit and Void Temper Root are both high level heavenly materials used for alchemy. With these two things as the main source of medicine, in addition to some supporting herbs and wood spirit jade, I should be able to create a miracle medicine capable of opening the third of the Eight Inner Hidden Gates.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming couldn’t bother thinking about these matters at this time. He revolved his true essence to the limit and then pointed at the Eight Dragon Jade Dawn Array. The flames suddenly fanned into a blazing conflagration.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Cosmic Melting Furnace violently trembled within the Eight Dragon Jade Dawn Array. It was as if there was some ancient vicious beast trapped with the furnace that was ready to rush out at any given moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming released the Heretical God Force as he simultaneously activated the strength of the Eight Inner Hidden Gates. Between Lin Ming’s eyebrows, the phoenix flame mark there began to blaze out with a golden light as sharp as a sword.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>With an explosion, the Eight Dragon Jade Dawn Array’s eight flame columns all collapsed at once. The Cosmic Melting Furnace’s lid shot up like a meteor, straight into the air.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kacha!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The lid heavily smashed into the Jade Mountain cave mansion, causing a large portion of the array formation-reinforced rock to shear off!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming’s face flushed red with blood. He looked at the two items suspended in the air. Neither of these items looked like miracle medicines. One was a completely jet black demon armor, and the other was a mass of thick, viscous blood.</span></p>
