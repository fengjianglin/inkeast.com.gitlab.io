 <p><strong>Chapter 141 Extreme Speed.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 141 – Extreme Speed</strong></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Penetrating Rainbow spear that was bent into a half arc flexed back to its original shape. The peak Bone Forging black armored martial artist was sent flying backwards by Lin Ming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In contrast, Lin Ming had not even taken half a step back!</span></p>
 <p><span style>In normal times, Lin Ming would lunge forwards and stab out his spear with his formidable momentum. Even if his spear could not directly kill the enemy, it would still leave a serious wound.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But now, if Lin Ming just wanted to rush forward, two vicious beasts equivalent to the early Bone Forging stage would immediately be at his right and left, trying to bowl him over and kill him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming cried out, and the Penetrating Rainbow spear fiercely swept outwards. The spear point was filled with true essence as it swept out, and these two vicious beasts’ heads immediately shook with a intense vibrating true essence and then exploded. The two vicious beasts’ heads were like watermelons that burst apart!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Poof! Poof! </span></i><span style>The two headless corpses fell to the ground, blood erupting like a gushing fountain from their bodies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thanks to the vicious beasts delaying for time, the peak Bone Forging martial artist that had been sent flying backwards by Lin Ming was able to recover his breath. He supported himself with his staff, and with the aid of the staff’s elasticity, he shot forwards. Both hands grasped the staff and directly pounded down at Lin Ming!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing this staff come at him in the vision of his eyes, Lin Ming’s mouth curved in a smile. He flicked the Penetrating Rainbow spear into his hands, and took a leaping step forwards. But in this single step, Lin Ming had reached a terrifying speed!</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Golden Roc Shattering the Void!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Under Lin Ming’s footsteps, distance had already lost its meaning. When the peak Bone Forging martial artist’s staff was descending, Lin Ming flickered in front of the Bone Forging martial artist as if he had teleported, and thrusted out his spear!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puff!</span></i><span style> The long spear pierced through the peak Bone Forging martial artist’s throat!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even ten thousand moves could be shattered with extreme speed. When one’s agility reached the pinnacle, they would have already killed their enemies before the enemy could even react!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The peak Bone Forging martial artist hadn’t expected Lin Ming to do this. Lin Ming hadn’t yet shown such a horrifying velocity, and the result was that he had died to Lin Ming’s spear!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Penetrating Rainbow spear was like a poisonous snake that was returning to its hole in the ground, and that peak Bone Forging martial artist’s throat was such a big, bloody hole.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the peak Bone Forging martial artist died, the other early Bone Forging stage vicious beasts and martial artists were no match for Lin Ming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Under Lin Ming’s alarming striking power and speed that was like flying ghosts, the Penetrating Rainbow spear was simply a death god’s scythe as it harvested the life of these vicious beasts and martial artists. Under Lin Ming’s ‘Golden Roc Shattering the Void’ movement skill, even if these vicious beasts and martial artists attacked, every single one would miss.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After killing several early Bone Forging stage vicious beasts, Lin Ming was able to catch his breath for a brief moment. Then, 5 or 6 phantoms appeared in the dreamland. The majority of these were peak Bone Forging martial artists or vicious beasts, but impressively, there was actually a silver armored martial artist that was at the Pulse Condensation Period!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A Pulse Condensation Period martial artist. Good, very good! Let me take a look and see just how big the disparity is between the present me and an ordinary Pulse Condensation Period martial artist!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing the appearance of a Pulse Condensation Period martial artist, Lin Ming’s fighting spirit combusted like a raging inferno. He had heard rumors that the limit of Ling Sen’s strength was able to compete with a weak Pulse Condensation Period martial artist. But this silver armored martial artist’s true essence wasn’t as rich; he had apparently just made a breakthrough to the Pulse Condensation Period, and the meridians through his body hadn’t yet made a complete connection. This sort of Pulse Condensation Period martial artist was the weakest of all. If Ling Sen were here, he would most likely be able to kill him!</span></p>
 <p><span style>But for Lin Ming to deal with him was just too difficult!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now, if Lin Ming wanted to, he could take the most sensible approach. He would avoid the Pulse Condensation Period martial artist, and use his great striking power, speed, and ‘Flow like Silk’ to continuously harvest points from the Bone Forging stage vicious beasts and martial artists.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the best way to maximize points. In fact, all the Seven Profound Martial House disciples were the same. If they ran into an enemy they could not deal with, they would use this method.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhang Guanyu and Ta Ku were no exception. These two individuals were still unable to kill a Pulse Condensation Period martial artist. At this time, they could only persist as long as they could under the vigilance of this Pulse Condensation Period martial artist and try to kill as many enemies as possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ta Ku relied on his formidable strength. Even in a situation where several Pulse Condensation Period martial artists appeared, he would still be able to find his way in and cleanly slay a Bone Forging stage martial artist! This was why he had always been placed above Zhang Guanyu, and had taken the throne of second rank on the Ranking Stone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Ling Ming had no desire to do this. He knew that with the points he had, his position in the top ten was already ironclad. Even if he killed more Bone Forging stage martial artists to rise to a higher rank, what significance would there be in that?</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past, Lin Ming had to struggle for resources by attaining a higher ranking. But now, Lin Ming was already undergoing the core disciple test, and thus enjoyed benefits no different from being in the top three ranks of the Ranking Stone. Therefore, points to him now were nothing more than clouds in the sky. As long as he entered the top ten ranks and obtained the Heavy Profound Soft Spear, that would be enough.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Constantly dodging the attacks of the Pulse Condensation Period martial artist and killing off the weaker enemies. Like this, his score would be higher, but the number of Pulse Condensation Period martial artists would also gradually increase. Therefore Lin Ming would completely lose the opportunity to kill the Pulse Condensation Period martial artist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What Lin Ming wanted to know was not how many points he could accumulate, but what the disparity was between him and a normal Pulse Condensation martial artist!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Die!” Lin Ming did not go to deal with the other enemies. He grasped the Penetrating Rainbow spear, and flew directly at the silver armored warrior!</span></p>
 <p><span style>……………………………</span></p>
 <p><span style>Outside the Ten Thousand Killing Array, the sixth incense stick had already burnt to its end. This result was as many people anticipated. Six incense sticks of time were not too long. The last time Murong Zi had participated in the Ten Thousand Killing Array assessment; she had also persisted four six incense sticks of time, and finally achieved rank 28.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But what everyone knew was that Lin Ming’s six incense sticks of time was much different than an averages person’s six incense sticks of time. The speed with which he killed his enemies was simply distressing!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The seventh incense stick just lit. Lin Ming seems to be approaching his limit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>During this time in the Ten Thousand Killing Array, Lin Ming’s face became flushed red with blood and his forehead was heavily sweating. Under the diversion of the crowds of Bone Forging stage martial artists, the pressure on him as he was battling the Pulse Condensation Period martial artist could be imagined!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The disparity between a Pulse Condensation Period martial artist and a Bone Forging stage martial artist was enormous, because a Pulse Condensation Period martial artist was able to connect all of their body’s meridians. The enemy Lin Ming was facing had just broken through the Pulse Condensation Period, so the meridians hadn’t thoroughly opened. But his extreme strength was truly abnormal!</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it was not for the movements of ‘Golden Roc Shattering the Void’, Lin Ming would have already been surrounded by enemies as he faced the Pulse Condensation Period martial artist, and suffered agonizing defeat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even so, with the passage of time, the wounds on Lin Ming’s body began to gradually increase. He experienced over a dozen injuries on his body, and had lost a massive amount of blood. There were several deep wounds where even bone could be seen. Even though Lin Ming was able to breathe like bellows, and breathe out a whirlpool, and also had the support of the ‘True Primal Chaos Formula’, he had already arrived at this limit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During that time, Lin Ming had pierced that silver armored knight with his spear. Although the spear had penetrated the armor and slightly injured the body, the intense vibrating true essence had passed into the body of the silver-armored knight!</span></p>
 <p><span style>But even though Lin Ming had poured all of his true essence into that strike, he was still only able to make his enemy cough up a mouthful of blood. ‘Flow like Silk’ was able to kill the enemy due to the vibration of true essence. However, the true essence in a Pulse Condensation Period martial artist was simply too thick. It diffused the vibrations to a certain extent as the shock came, and therefore Lin Ming had been unable to kill his enemy in a single strike.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time, the seventh incense stick had burnt less than half. In the Ten Thousand Killing Array, Lin Ming let out a stuffy cough and was suddenly drawn back from the dreamland of the Ten Thousand Killing Array.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The assessment has ended!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming had eventually failed to kill the Pulse Condensation Period stage martial artist; he only just injured him with his spear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although his strength was far inferior, with the support of the ‘True Primal Chaos Formula’, Lin Ming had been able to last for a good while until his defeat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While under the attacks and diversions from numerous Bone Forging stage martial artists and vicious beasts, Lin Ming had still been able to injure a Pulse Condensation Period martial artist. Even though this Pulse Condensation Period martial artist was a phantom conjured by the Ten Thousand Killing Array, this result was enough for him to take pride in. If this news spread out, it would create a stir within the entire Sky Fortune Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, after having injured that Pulse Condensation Period martial artist, facing the attacks from so many more Bone Forging stage enemies, Lin Ming had been forced to eliminate several of the Bone Forging martial artist and vicious beasts. The end result was that another Pulse Condensation Period martial artist had appeared, and this one was even stronger than the least. Because of the increased pressure on Lin Ming, he was finally defeated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming stepped down from the altar, and the eyes of everyone had already turned to the Ranking Stone. They wanted to personally see with their eyes, just how high Lin Ming would be arranged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming had numerous fanboys and fangirls. For instance, the many young junior apprentice brother and sister linmaniacs of the Human Hall who fanatically supported and worshipped Lin Ming; they believed that the omnipotent Lin Ming could accomplish anything. But older, sensible disciples who saw reason, they assumed that the reason Lin Ming came today was to warm up, and see how far he was from reaching the top ten rankings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Seven Profound Martial House Master had given Lin Ming three months to reach the top ten rankings. This definitely was not some random date that he had set. What kind of person was the Seven Profound Martial House Master? He must have seen Lin Ming’s potential, and estimated the speed of his progress, thus he listed out the series of awards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Three months to reach the top ten; that should be Lin Ming’s limits!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Otherwise, if Lin Ming was lax even just a tad, it would be impossible for him to reach the top ten in three months.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This Lin Ming wants to amaze the world with a single, brilliant feat. Since he dared come today, he must not be too far from the top ten. Even if he cannot enter this month, he should be able to next month.” A Heavenly Abode disciple ranked 20</span><span style>th</span><span style> commented as he swung his fan. The more points one had, the slower the calculation on the Ranking Stone would be. Now, several breaths of time had passed, and yet there was not any stir on the Ranking Stone. Lin Ming should be close to the top ten.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm. The Martial House Master’s judgement shouldn’t be wrong. The fact that he gave Lin Ming three months to advance to the top ten was not some random guess. He must have already seen through Lin Ming’s potential, and didn’t want to leave anything to accident. Lin Ming should be able to advance to the top ten next month! If so, he might even possibly defeat Zhang Guanyu in the fourth month’s match! To defeat Zhang Guanyu in four months, that is simply too fearful. If Junior Apprentice Brother Lin surpasses us this time, I just don’t know how I will respond…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man who answered was a Heavenly Abode disciple who was ranked in the top 20. These two friends would soon graduate. They had been fellow disciples for five years, and had entered the Earth Hall together, and then entered the Heavenly Abode together. They were very good lifelong friends. These two people had just passed by, and after learning that Lin Ming was participating in the assessment, came especially to see.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In their view, for Lin Ming to advance to the top ten in three months was already an inconceivable myth, something only heard about in children’s bedtime stories.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And now, if he managed to reach the top ten in two months, they really wouldn’t be able to find the words to describe such a fantastical situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Any talent, genius, monster, evildoer or other adjective, would simply not be enough to describe Lin Ming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their eyes were focused on the second row of the Ranking Stone, as they waited for the illusory magic array to calculate the points. The second row was the location where the disciples in the tens were located.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After several more breaths of time, there was finally that trademark rippling distortion on the Ranking Stone. However, this fluctuation actually appeared on one the first row.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fifth and sixth names were shoved apart by some unseen strength, and Lin Ming’s name impressively appeared between them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming, rank 6.</span></p>
