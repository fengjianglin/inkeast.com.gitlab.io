 <p><span style>Chapter 1439 – Golden Armor Warrior Array</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Three quarter hours later, the several final trial challengers had also been eliminated from the trial by Lin Ming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, in the Hunter Game, there was only Lin Ming left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The martial artists outside all glanced at each other. Lin Ming’s methods were truly as Charming had said. He had swept out all the other trial challengers in order to reduce the difficulty of the game so that he could pass it himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This method seemed completely farcical because not only was every trial challenger who entered extremely strong, but finding them in the vast game world wasn’t easy either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet Lin Ming had accomplished this, and his actions were neat and merciless. In just several hours of time, he had managed to complete all of this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His methods left one imagining just how he had accomplished them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time, in the game world, Lin Ming already had 15 skill badges.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These skull badges had been taken from the other trial challengers. There were only 12 trial challengers to begin with, and the other three badges were from the prey that some other trial challengers had killed. Now, their hard work had benefited Lin Ming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s time to hunt… this is when the true game begins.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming licked his lips. In this dimensional realm there were all sorts of creatures. By killing them he could obtain skull badges.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He closed his eyes and let his sense spread outwards. Soon, he found the first prey.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming’s figure flashed and he vanished from where he was, rapidly flying in a new direction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In just several breaths of time Lin Ming had flown several hundred miles. Then, he came to a halt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right beneath Lin Ming was a swamp. The grass and waters were bright and calm, without any waves at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming fell down towards the surface of the swamp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just when Lin Ming was 40-50 feet from the water’s surface, the placid water surface suddenly exploded. A 100 foot long alligator rushed out at an unbelievable speed, causing thousands of jins of water and mud to shoot up. The alligator’s jaws were wide open, large enough to swallow a house. It bit down at Lin Ming.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kacha!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The alligator’s jaws snapped together, swallowing Lin Ming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, before it could fully swallow Lin Ming, the alligator’s head exploded. Its body split apart as blood rained down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A savage power of thunder and fire gushed out from the alligator’s maw, instantly killing it. Lin Ming had used the grandmist space to protect himself, and when he attacked with the Thunder and Fire Laws, he hadn’t been injured at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A shining skull badge fell into Lin Ming’s hand. This was the reward for hunting down the alligator.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In this game world, there were only hunters and prey. Whoever was stronger was the hunter and whoever was weaker was the prey.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“These prey are really weak at the start.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming looked at the headless alligator corpse that was twitching beneath him. He flung out a fireball and burnt it to ashes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon, the headless alligator completely vanished, turning into a stream of pure energy that flowed into the swamp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So that’s how it is. All of the beasts in this world are energy beings. They aren’t illusions or material beings, but puppets made of energy. Perhaps the origin energy runes we paid to enter this trial are used to maintain the activation of the array formation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Lin Ming was thinking like this, his figure flashed as he flew to the next prey.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Under his incomparably powerful divine sense, none of these beasts could hide from his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There wasn’t a single prey that was able to contend with Lin Ming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming’s badge count slowly increased. From 10 to 20 to 30…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“49.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming counted the badges. He hadn’t encountered any difficulties in gathering this many badges so far.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is the 50</span><span style>th</span><span style> badge.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming looked at a giant lizard in front of him. This lizard was a tad more formidable than the monsters before but it was essentially the same. It was easily cut down by Lin Ming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>According to the rules, the difficulty of the Hunter Game was originally set to the cultivation of the strongest trial challenger. This was in order to test a trial challenger’s talent and not their absolute strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A lucky one-star Asura could already pass this checkpoint, let alone Lin Ming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After hunting down 50 prey, the strength of the prey rose to yet another level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They’re getting stronger.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The creatures grew increasingly strong. However, to Lin Ming, this difference was only killing them in five moves instead of three. He still easily exterminated them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His number of badges had now reached 60.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Another two hours later, he had reached 64!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is easy…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming took a brief rest as he readied himself to kill the 65</span><span style>th</span><span style> monster.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he continued at this speed he would soon have killed 100 prey. However, he had a feeling that before he killed the final one, there would be some event that occurred.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Lin Ming was pondering this, the scenery around him suddenly changed!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The power of space wildly flew around him, dizzying and mystifying. The grasslands vanished as Lin Ming suddenly arrived in a spacious wilderness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And at the same time, a pale red array formation appeared beneath Lin Ming’s feet. The runes flickered and shimmered. These runes were similar to the most common god runes of the Asura Road.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm… this is… an array formation?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As this thought flashed through Lin Ming’s mind, there was a series of clanking sounds as golden-armored warriors began to appear in front of Lin Ming. These warriors wore thick suits of golden armor. Their faces could not be seen, but their aura was filled with a thick killing intent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Puppets?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming paused. He could feel that these golden-armored warriors were puppets formed from energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They continued to emerge all around Lin Ming. Each warrior stepped atop an array symbol. In total, there were 36 warriors.</span></p>
 <p><span style>36 warriors?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming looked down at the skull badges in his hand. There were 64 badges and with these 36 opponents that had appeared, that just happened to add up to 100.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So that’s how it is. Whether it was the previous prey or other trial challengers, all of them can only be considered an appetizer. No matter if I killed them with ease or with great difficulty it still wouldn’t affect the final result, because in this Hunter Game I was destined to meet these 36 golden-armored warriors at the final checkpoint. No matter how many trial challengers enter this Hunter Game, the game will control the number of skull badges, making it so that only one person is able to face these last 36 golden-armored warriors, otherwise it would have been impossible to collect 64 badges to begin with. This is the final battle here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming thought. He began to sizzle with fighting spirit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he could kill these 36 golden-armored warriors then he would be able to pass this trial perfectly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming extracted the Phoenix Blood Spear, his entire body revolving with energy. He did not underestimate these new enemies. The divine god that created the Asura Road had reached an unimaginable level of martial arts cultivation. If this person were to establish a trial then the conditions for passing it must be extremely high! Even though Lin Ming was considered the number one talent of his race, he still wouldn’t underestimate anything here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm? The runes that these golden-armored warriors are standing on seem to correspond to the Concept of the 33 Layered Heavens? But if so, how could the Concept of the 33 Layered Heavens evolve into 36 positions?”</span></p>
