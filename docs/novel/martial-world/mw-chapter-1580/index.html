However, Imperial Concubine Moon coldly sneered, not immediately stepping forwards. Instead, she turned towards the side, looking in the distance. After several breaths of time, there was the sound of rustling cloth as an eagle-eyed yellow-robed old man stepped forwards on the wind. Although he didn’t seem too fast, he arrived beside Imperial Concubine Moon in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This eagle-eyed old man was one of Lord Snow’s trusted subordinates as well as Blood Moon’s good friend – Eunuch Liang!</span></p>

Of these five, the only true grand chief eunuch was Eunuch Wei; the other four were vice chiefs. Eunuch Liang was one of them and he supported Lord Snow, standing opposite to the Empress’s ally, Eunuch Sun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These two people had similar cultivations, both of them at the peak Holy Lord realm!</span></p>

If they were to fight then they could last much longer than a martial artist on the same level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Imperial Concubine Moon, this old servant has come late. I am sorry for frightening you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Eunuch Liang was originally loyal to Lord Snow and Blood Moon was also someone he had recommended to Lord Snow. With these relations between them, he naturally wouldn’t idly stand by as the Empress decided to harm her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And as an accompanying eunuch that was part of Imperial Concubine Moon’s retinue, he naturally had a valid reason to join Imperial Concubine Moon to enter Arid Peace Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eunuch Liang, it must have been hard for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Imperial Concubine Moon smirked. With Eunuch Liang here she had even more chips to play with. Even if the Empress wanted to move against her, it wouldn’t be so easy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although she was wounded and couldn’t display her full strength, if Eunuch Liang was added on then even if she had to face the peak Holy Lord Eunuch Sun, half-step World King Empress, as well as the many guard eunuchs and their array formations in Arid Peace Palace, she still wouldn’t be at a disadvantage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had the capital to struggle for victory!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So it was Eunuch Liang. It’s been a while since we’ve seen each other and it seems that your Shadeless Steps have risen to another level!” Eunuch Sun said, his smile not reaching his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, the feeling is mutual. Eunuch Sun, you seem as if you’ll step into the half-step World King realm soon. I fear that in several more years you’ll catch up to Eunuch Wei!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Eunuch Liang and Eunuch Sun were on opposites sides to begin with. Now that they encountered each other here, they naturally stood in sharp contention to each other!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Eunuch Sun coldly snorted. “Great Chief Wei has already cultivated the Sunflower Melody to the eighth level. How could I possibly surpass him!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Eunuch Sun no longer bantered with Eunuch Liang. He turned to Blood Moon and said, “Imperial Concubine Moon, please enter the palace. Do not have the Empress wait for such a long time!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How annoying! Whatever I do, I don’t need a minion like you to order me around!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blood Moon’s voice was cold. From the start until now, she had referred to Eunuch Sun as a lackey. But in truth, as a peak Holy Lord powerhouse, Eunuch Sun had significant status in the palace. There were many high level characters that treated him with due respect. For Blood Moon to call him a minion really grated on his ears!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who were you saying is annoying?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this time, a calm and dignified voice sounded out. This voice had a strange piercing power, as if it could reach into one’s mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the voice of the Empress!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have summoned your presence and yet you linger at the entrance without entering. What a great air of importance you have!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Empress’ voice was forceful and imperious. Blood Moon remained calm. She flung her sleeves and walked into the grand hall with her back straight and her head high, looking directly at Empress Naye. She lightly bowed in accordance with palace etiquette and said, “For what matter is the Empress summoning me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blood Moon’s voice contained a hidden sense of pride. Since the Empress created such a commotion and even summoned her here it was obvious what she wanted; she wanted to deal with Blood Moon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But, Blood Moon didn’t seem as if she was defeated at all. She remained tall and lofty, an unbending blade of grass in the storm, a chrysanthemum that withstood the frost. This sort of feeling was one that the Empress hated!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Empress wanted Imperial Concubine Moon to bow in awe and fear, not standing in sharp opposition like she was now!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Empress’ smoky eyes frowned. She gently lifted her gown and let it slowly fall. Beside her, 10 eunuch guards readied a battle array!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These 10 eunuch guards were all Holy Lord powerhouses. The 10 of them stood in particularly chosen positions to form a 10 man battle array. And this battle array locked onto Blood Moon. The 10 court eunuchs had gathered their essence energy, their breath long and stable. They were like 10 leopards, primed and ready to leap, filled with danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And around the eunuchs were eight old maids. These old maids had already stayed in the imperial palace for at least 10,000 years. Although they all had wrinkles on their faces, their inner worlds were filled with boundless amounts of energy; it was clear they were all masters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Including the eunuch guards and old maids, there were a total of 18 people. Beneath the feet of these 18 people were shimmering runes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming had studied all sorts of dao patterns. With a single glance, he could see that these lines were carved by a divine runic master. They could strengthen the martial artists that stood on them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With 18 people standing as one, although their cultivation was only at the Holy Lord realm, if they joined together they might be able to contend with a World King!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Besides these 18 people there was also the half-step World King Empress as well as Eunuch Sun. This lineup of powerhouses within Arid Peace Palace could be called a formidable force!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this time, Eunuch Sun sent a sound transmission to Empress Naye. After she heard it she sneered and looked towards Lin Ming, shouting at him, “You minion, who gave you the courage to live in Full Moon Hall!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming was startled. He didn’t think that the fire would burn so quickly that it reached him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Minion?” Lin Ming scoffed. For so many years, no one had ever called him a minion. Not even his enemies had done so!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You old hag, just what gave you the ability to act so superior? Who do you think you are? If I live in Full Moon Hall, what does that have to do with a granny like you?”</span></p>

Who cared if she was an Empress? To Lin Ming, that title was nothing at all!</span></p>

Her tone became increasingly grim. “What a wonderful minion, to dare speak against me! In so many years, no one has dared to speak to me like that! Full Moon Hall is a special quarter for concubines in the harem. Those men that can enter are only eunuchs! And yet a minion like you actually dared to ask me why you can’t live in Full Moon Hall? If that’s the case then someone go up and inspect that minion to see if he’s been cleanly castrated or not! If he hasn’t been cleanly castrated then have the chief doctor cut it off once more!”</span></p>

If there was a man quietly and secretly living in the quarters of an imperial concubine, then that was a capital crime deserving of death by 10,000 cuts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But, concerning Marvel Blue Imperial Palace, it was a martial artist’s palace and thus the rules weren’t so strict to begin with. When this was added with the fact that Imperial Concubine Moon wasn’t a true imperial concubine anyway and she also had Lord Snow’s token, she was well within her rights to bring Lin Ming into Full Moon Hall without violating any rules. But now, the Empress had grabbed this point. Since she was cleaning up the harem, she would first start with Imperial Concubine Moon. This was what they meant by condemning someone without a care for the pretext!</span></p>

However, his right hand was already tracing his spatial ring.</span></p>

She glared at Naye, coldly saying, “Naye, the reason for everything you’ve done is to bring me here and find an excuse to punish me, so why must you attack a bystander! Naye, I heard that 100,000 years ago when you were at the Divine Sea realm, you were a champion of the Marvel Blue Nation’s martial meeting of outstanding young elites. That is the reason why the eyes of the Marvel Blue Emperor landed on you and the reason he brought you into the palace. Now, I would like to experience just how great the strength of this martial meeting champion is!”</span></p>

At some time, he had placed a pair of divine iron gloves on his hands. The gloves were fierce and sharp, the 10 fingers ending in daggers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Eunuch Sun’s weapons were a pair of iron gloves.</span></p>

A simmering killing intent rolled off his body. His weapon of choice was also a pair of iron gloves. It seemed that this type of weapon was especially suited to the Sunflower Melody.</span></p>

Good! Very good! I’ve long suspected that there was some issue with you. After entering the palace you have always kept your appearance covered and isolated from all probing senses. I’ve long wanted to remove a dangerous character like you. I will tear down your veil and see just who you are! How could I tolerate such an unknown and disastrous character like you within the sacred grounds of my palace!”</span></p>

Now, she had ruled over the harem for 90,000 years and had long ago formed a great and majestic dignity!</span></p>

There were countless imperial concubines that wished to capture the favor of the Marvel Blue Emperor. As long as one could obtain his favor, then not only did it mean authority and status but far richer resources. Naye was able to stand out amongst this treacherous harem and climb to the highest position. She didn’t depend on just her outstanding talent, stunning looks, and a physique that was suitable for dual cultivating, but she also relied on her ruthless and savage methods!</span></p>
