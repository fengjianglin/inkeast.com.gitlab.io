 <p><span style>Chapter 479 – Wait For Me There</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming knew that Mu Chihuo and Lei Jingtian had come specifically for him. If he left Mu Qingyi or the other Elders here and ran away, nothing would happen to them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Mu Qianyu was different. Mu Qingshu desired Mu Qianyu as well as her Vermillion Bird bloodline, and had been drooling over it for a long time. With Lei Jingtian here, there was nothing that Mu Qianyu could do to resist him. As for Mu Qingshu, he was an extremely depraved individual that was capable of any despicable action imaginable. Lin Ming did not dare to imagine the consequences that would happen if he left Mu Qianyu here and escaped by himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If that happened, then even if he escaped and reached the Revolving Core realm in the future, it would be a tragedy that could never be recovered from even if he tore Mu Qingshu into pieces!</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Lin Ming felt the Escape Symbol in his hand, his mind rapidly raced and his forehead was already wet with sweat. He knew that this Escape Symbol was precious, but he didn’t think that it was precious to the point that even Mu Qianyu wouldn’t have one. Before this, Mu Fengxian must have thought that Mu Qianyu would never be any fatal danger; she never imagined that Mu Chihuo would have ignored the bloodstain contract and rebelled against the sect!</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Lei Jingtian held the Thunder Light Sword in his hand, a hazy purple electric light spun around the blade, like an ephemeral dream. This unique Disenchanting Dream Light was like thunder and also light; it was elusive and confounding. They didn’t even need Mu Chihuo – just Lei Jingtian was enough to deal with everyone present.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, Lin Ming, I want to see just what tricks you have up your sleeve this time!” Mu Qingshu disdainfully said as he sneered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he hadn’t started speaking again before the silent Lin Ming suddenly shot out!</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the blood of the Ancient Phoenix shined with a dazzling red glow between his eyebrows, the Heretical God Force also erupted. Atop the Great Desolate Blood Halberd, the crimson blood seals rapidly spiraled around!</span></p>
 <p><span style>In that instant, Lin Ming had used every card in his hand. His strength shot to its highest point!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Primeval Halberd Strike!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>15 Blood Drinking Seals twisted, forming a giant vortex. Lin Ming’s sudden action caused Mu Qingshu’s complexion to instantly changed. His original crazy grin had frozen in place. Mu Qingshu immediately felt a formidable pulling force working on him, and he couldn’t help but be caught up in the suction force. Mu Qingshu realized that Lin Ming knew he had no hope of escaping, so he would eliminate him before he died!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandfather, save me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Qingshu was greatly shocked. In front of Lin Ming, he simply didn’t have the ability to defend. He did not want to die. He was just about to see Lin Ming die and obtain Mu Qianyu! If he died here, he would have nothing at all!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Humph, how naïve!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lei Jingtian waved his palm, and a normal-looking purple thunder that seemed like electricity and light instantly launched into the crimson vortex.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as the attacks struck each other, the crimson vortex violently burst apart. The 15 Blood Drinking Seals were blasted in all directions. Lin Ming coughed and flew backwards, soaring dozens of feet until he smashed into the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had tried to instantly kill Mu Qingshu to save himself from future troubles, but Lin Ming’s plan had failed. His strength wasn’t at its peak condition. Compared to Lei Jingtian, the strength difference between the two at this moment was just too great!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha! You idiot! You want to hurt me? Dream on!” Mu Qingshu contemptuously laughed. Seeing Lin Ming in this state, his thoughts were smoother and his inner energy felt better; his entire body was incomparably comfortable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lin Ming!” Mu Qianyu’s eyes blazed as she rushed towards Lin Ming’s side. “Lin Ming, are you alright!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m fine.” In fact, Lin Ming hadn’t been wounded. He looked deeply into Mu Qianyu’s eyes and said with a true essence sound transmission, “Wait for me at the entrance to the bloody wilderness…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?” Mu Qianyu paused. She didn’t know why Lin Ming would suddenly say this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming’s eyes flashed with determination. He clenched the Escape Symbol in his hand, spoke the incantation, and then pressed it into Mu Qianyu’s hand…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm, this is…” Mu Qianyu felt something cool slip into her hand. Before she could react, a dim light emerged from her palm. Mu Qianyu’s heart suddenly surged with a discomforting restlessness, “Lin Ming, you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait for me there!”</span></p>
 <p><span style> These simple words were firm, confident, and filled with the air of one unafraid of death! As they fell into Mu Qianyu’s ears, every word sunk into her being. In that moment, the sound of countless thunderclaps exploded in Mu Qianyu’s ear, and a deep, agonizing, and inexplicable pain filled her heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As these words echoed in her mind, they began to distort, as if sound itself was being endlessly stretched out… In that moment, Mu Qianyu felt as if she had lost something important. The faint restlessness in her heart became stronger and stronger. Mu Qianyu’s eyes widened as her body was suddenly surrounded by a strange energy. Lin Ming’s features blurred as they faded into an infinite expanse of space, going farther and farther away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lin Ming!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Qianyu cried out. She reached out to grab Lin Ming, but at this time, all sounds and all sights instantly vanished into the horizon…</span></p>
 <p><span style>…………</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damn! What trick is this!?” Mu Qingshu could only watch helplessly as Mu Qianyu was covered by a hazy white light, instantly disappearing. He could not believe this had happened, and he could also not accept that this had happened!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Qianyu had been sent off by Lin Ming!</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Mu Qianyu disappeared, then how would he give vent to this rage in his heart?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lin Ming, I will kill you!” Mu Qingshu cried out, his eyes turning mad.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chihuo’s complexion was also ugly. He was able to recognize that what Lin Ming had just used was Mu Fengxian’s Escape Symbol. “It’s a bit troubling for that girl to escape. Brother Lei, let’s not delay any further and kill Lin Ming. Then we can look for Mu Qianyu. It wouldn’t be good if that girl managed to get a message back to Divine Phoenix Island!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, alright!” Lei Jingtian smiled with indifference. Whether or not news of this matter returned to Divine Phoenix Island, it would not impact him. In truth, all he wanted to do was kill Lin Ming and obtain the ancient devil art techniques in his spatial ring, as well as his Purple Comet Spear and two Thunder Souls!</span></p>
 <p><span style>In addition, what was most important was that Lei Jingtian wanted to know just how Lin Ming had managed to fuse two Thunder Souls into one. If he could also achieve this feat, then it would be of great advantage to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason that Lei Jingtian was willing to come and kill Lin Ming was first because of the old hatred between them, and second because Mu Chihuo had promised that as long as he killed Lin Ming, all of the secrets, cultivation method manuals, and other treasures that Lin Ming had would belong to him. Just as long as Mu Chihuo was able to keep Lin Ming’s corpse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This boy is too emotional, he cares about this sort of sentimental love too much. He gave a woman his only chances to escape… what an idiot!” Lei Jingtian laughed. In his opinion, this sort of self-sacrificing action was for the stupid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Qingyi had watched from the side and witnessed the entire process. Lin Ming had given his chance to escape to Mu Qianyu. This action caused her heart to ache with pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lin Ming, hurry up and run! We will hold him off!” As Mu Qingyi spoke, a chilling sword light covered her as she slashed her sword at Lei Jingtian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fragmented Ice Cloud!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Humph! You think you are qualified?” Without waiting for Lei Jingtian, Mu Chihuo stepped forwards and shot out his palm. Without even needing his sword, a brilliant inferno of roaring flames suddenly shot out, cracking the ice crystals and then directly pulverizing them!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Mu Yanzhuo stopped Mu Bingyun, and Lei Jingtian attacked Lin Ming!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sound of rolling thunder filled the air. It mixed with a shining dream-like light, turning into a thick purple beam that pierced towards Lin Ming.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The beam of light penetrated through the earth, causing rocks to scatter into the air. Lin Ming jumped back, avoiding the frontal attack. However, he was still injured by the shockwaves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As that endless purple light touched Lin Ming’s body, it was like countless steel needles had pierced his spiritual sea. Lin Ming’s body suddenly trembled!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Cha cha cha!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>In Lin Ming’s spiritual sea, that purple light fell like rain. In that critical moment, the massive black vortex of the Samsara martial intent appeared, blocking the attack of the purple rain!</span></p>
 <p><span style>That endless purple light was twisted into the swirling black vortex and disappeared without a trace!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh! Lei Jingtian sneered, but then the smile froze on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What!? He’s fine even after taking the attack of my Disenchanting Dream Light?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lei Jingtian did not believe that a mere Houtian realm martial artist was able to defend against his Disenchanting Dream Light. How could this be possible?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You want to run away? Think again!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Lei Jingtian saw that Lin Ming wanted to run away, he coldly snorted and shot forwards! With Lei Jingtian’s formidable strength, he was able to overcome the suppressive laws of this world to a certain extent and fly. With a speed two or three times faster than Lin Ming’s, he chased after him!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damn.” Lin Ming grit his teeth and galvanized Golden Roc Shattering the Void to the limit, shooting forwards like a bolt of lightning. But no matter how amazing Golden Roc Shattering the Void was, Lin Ming’s attainments were limited to a general understanding of the Concept of Wind. He hadn’t even yet crossed into the Concept of Space, so how could his speed compare to the late Revolving Core master Lei Jingtian?</span></p>
 <p><span style>In just a few blinks of the eye, Lin Ming was overtaken by Lei Jingtian!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lei Jingtian pressed down his palm at Lin Ming! The might of the palm strike was followed by billowing thunder. The space around Lin Ming seemed to tense up, as if completely locking him within.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This palm strike was one that Lei Jingtian had used with his full and complete strength. Even if Lei Jingtian’s true essence were suppressed to 20%, it still wasn’t something that Lin Ming would be able to stop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lei Jingtian wanted to kill Lin Ming with a single palm. He had originally thought of capturing Lin Ming, but after being surprised by Lin Ming’s burst of strength again and again, he had changed his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This palm strike was unavoidable. It pressed down with overwhelming strength. At that moment, the specter of death was rapidly closing in!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming gave a loud shot, and his pupils filled with crimson light like they were ponds of blood!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Blood Drinking Seal, explode!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Atop the Great Desolate Blood Halberd, a Blood Drinking Seal formed from an early Revolving Core master exploded and a crimson light emanated outwards. The explosion from the Blood Drinking Seal formed from a Revolving Core master was able to defend against Lei Jingtian’s palm strike. However, Lin Ming was still struck by the wind of the palm, and his body flew back like a leaf caught in a brutal storm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Lin Ming vomited out a mouthful of blood, his face had whitened to the point of being terrifying!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What!?” Lei Jingtian was shocked. He absolutely didn’t think that Lin Ming would be able to defend against a strike that he had placed his full force behind. ‘This boy, just how strong is his soul defense? Every time I attack, it is combined with a soul attack. Not to mention a Houtian martial artist, but even an early Revolving Core martial artist would fall unconscious if struck by my soul attack.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The difference in their cultivation was simply too great, and the soul defense capabilities of the Samsara martial intent were not invincible. At this time, Lin Ming had a splitting headache, and his thoughts were in a disorganized mess. Even the path in front of him seemed to blur.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment in his mind, a sense of primal desperation began to wash through him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I cannot die here!’</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style>Lin Ming bit down on the tip of his tongue, spraying out blood essence. Since he could not take another Scarlet Blood Pill, the action that Lin Ming had taken was to combust his own blood essence!</span></p>
