It seems you really are willing to do everything you can.” Sheng Mei faintly smiled. “To go to war for the spiritas for 10 million years and destroy the saints? For a race that is already in steep decline, is it worth it? You entered the Asura Road, entered the Soul World, and I don’t know what price you must have paid to do so or what dangers you experienced along the way, but all that you’ve done cannot change the end result. With your miniscule amount of strength do you really believe you can affect the rise and fall of an entire race?</span></p>

The saints will not give you the slightest chance!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sheng Mei’s words were like needles that jabbed into Lin Ming’s innermost feelings. Lin Ming’s thoughts shook. As he looked at Sheng Mei, his breath caught in his throat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are a young Divine Dragon that hasn’t fully grown into your own skin, and yet you wish to place such heavy shackles upon yourself? Is it worth it? I advise you to give up on humanity. With your talent, there is no need for you to tie yourself to the sinking ship that is humanity. You cannot imagine what your future can be like. If you follow me we can create a foundation that will last for billions of years! Your talent is even beyond mine. Together, we can study the ancient inheritances and create our own legends, becoming existences that usher in a new, prosperous era! Just like the Asura Road Master! Just like the first ancestor of the spiritas!</span></p>

But… do you know anything about their races? Do you know which race the Asura Road Master comes from, or what race the spiritas’ first ancestor comes from? The Spiritas Holy Scripture may be called the Spiritas Holy Scripture, but the truth is that the golden pages never mention the spiritas to begin with. As the most powerful race in the 33 Heavens, us spiritas recklessly formed relations with the first ancestor to call ourselves his descendants!</span></p>

If they can do this, why can’t we?</span></p>

In that moment, she was like a sorceress that tempted the will of all mankind, her every word filled with the power to lead the heart astray.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that moment, Lin Ming really did fall into a daze. But, he quickly composed himself. He could feel a powerful soul force emanating from Sheng Mei that filled her words with an incredible attractive power, making it so that anyone who listened to her couldn’t help but desire to comply with her wishes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Me and you, a foundation for billions of years? One era will not accommodate two peerless characters. In the past, the Asura Road Master and the creator of the Holy Scripture fought a life and death battle. Moreover, within the ranks of the spiritas there is also the true master of the Soul Rapture Holy Lands – the Soul Emperor. How could he not also desire to establish his own foundation that will last for billions of years?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming’s words were chilly, but his heart was all over the place.</span></p>

In these changing times he was nothing but a tiny splash of water. No matter how much he struggled his actions didn’t seem worthy of mention at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From when he had stepped onto the road of martial arts until now, this was the first time he had felt such a deep sense of hopelessness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even when he was 15 years old and left Green Mulberry City to go to the capital of the Sky Fortune Divine Kingdom, even facing his childhood girlfriend Lan Yunyue who left him for someone else, even when the army major tried to put up obstacles in his way, even when he had no place to go and was forced to go to Great Clarity Pavilion to work in the kitchen deboning beasts, he had never felt so useless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that time, he had believed that as long as he was diligent enough and put in enough effort, he would be able to succeed. No matter how thorny the path was before him, he would struggle for a brighter future with his will and perseverance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But now, Lin Ming felt that even if he wanted to put in as much effort as he could, he didn’t even have a direction he could go in. There was nothing but confusion all around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, even if he was confused, he knew that even in Green Mulberry City where he grew up, there were people he knew. In this world, there were still people he considered his friends and family. There was the Lin Clan, his parents, the disciples of Divine Phoenix Island, the Ancient Phoenix Clan, Mu Qianyu, Qin Xingxuan, Lin Xiaoge, Mo Eversnow, Xiao Moxian, Senior Divine Dream, Empyrean Vast Universe…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was also the person who he had never met before but had died trying to resist the saints in battle – Empyrean Primordius. And there was Empyrean Primordius’ comrade who had entrusted Lin Ming with his greatest legacy, the Black Dragon. There was also the ancient goddess, who had handed over her body to Mo Eversnow and saved his life…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finally, there was even Lin Ming’s unborn child…</span></p>

After growing for over a hundred years, he had come into contact with innumerable people. Some of them were only passing acquaintances, but some of them he shared extremely deep and complex relationships with. Some had helped him grow and given him a new lease on life. Some of them were elders who had recognized and supported him. Some had saved his life before. And some were even his wives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were all a part of humanity.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming muttered, as if he were telling Sheng Mei this and also telling himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sheng Mei looked at Lin Ming and lightly said, “I just didn’t want to see you ruined because of this. But since you insist, I won’t try to change your mind any longer. However, if you only wish for the spiritas to intervene with the saints, your chips are far from enough…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The only exception is if you can obtain all the golden pages and also help me find the approximate path to cultivate the Law of Eternal Life. If so, then I can probably change the decision of the spiritas and have them attack the saints so that humanity has more time. But… I don’t think you have this ability.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sheng Mei put forth her own conditions. But upon hearing this, Lin Ming felt his heart drop to the pit of his stomach. Not to mention the golden pages, but just helping Sheng Mei find the approximate path to cultivate the Law of Eternal Life left Lin Ming completely clueless. The only possible way would be for him to give Sheng Mei the Magic Cube.</span></p>

With Sheng Mei’s talent, if she were to obtain the Magic Cube, what boundaries would she reach?</span></p>

She faintly said, “All of you, disperse!”</span></p>

The Great Brahmic God King had even used his Boundless Great Art, using up a part of his cultivation to seek out Lin Ming’s whereabouts. And after that, many disciples had died and they had even shouted out a sky high price to have all these people attack Lin Ming to kill him. But with Sheng Mei’s few words, she wanted them all to leave?</span></p>

Empress, aren’t you pushing us too far?”</span></p>

They didn’t know what Lin Ming had spoken to Sheng Mei about in their sound transmissions, but they could confirm that Lin Ming had some unusual relationship with Sheng Mei, one that wasn’t ordinary at all. Otherwise, Sheng Mei would not have spoken with Lin Ming for such a long time.</span></p>
