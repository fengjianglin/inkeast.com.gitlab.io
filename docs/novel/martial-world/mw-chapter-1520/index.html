After all, the avatar that the Asura Road Master refined in the past did not use the Essence Spirit Embryo Stone as the material, but he had instead divided his own flesh, blood, and soul, similar to the relationship between Frost Dream and Divine Dream.</span></p>

But at this time, five ghostly spears pierced towards Ash Murder’s chest from three different angles.</span></p>

In the final throes of his life, he waved his hands, sending those four iron-armored spectral soldiers that he held the spears of flying far away.</span></p>

Before he could respond, he felt his head shake. With a loud bang, a vibrating force passed from his head to his ears, blowing out his eardrums and causing blood to leak out from his ears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Like this, a black 10,000 jin hammer smashed into Ash Murder’s head. At this moment, Ash Murder’s eye lost focus. He felt the entire world blur, everything seeming to fade far away from him…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He fell to his knees, the blood leaking from his head covering his eyes. This was also the final moment of Ash Murder’s storied life. He never imagined that he, with his half-step Empyrean cultivation, who had lived a revered life, would actually be played to death by a Divine Lord junior in the end.</span></p>

His consciousness began to fade away…</span></p>

A half-step Empyrean had died in Bai Qi’s tomb, underneath the assault of the grand array formation here and Lin Ming’s planning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">108 iron-armored spectral soldiers. Of them, 52 had been destroyed by Ash Murder. Now, only slightly more than half were left.</span></p>

Many of the iron-armored spectral soldiers returned to their statue-like state. In this battle, the array formation had consumed far too much energy. If this grand array formation was said to be able to persist for several billion more years before this, now it could only last for several hundred million more years and it would also be much weaker than it was originally.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You stay inside. I’m going out to take a look.” Lin Ming said to Xiao Moxian within Primordius Heavenly Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Moxian pursed her lips, but she didn’t argue with Lin Ming. There were layers upon layers of dangers in Bai Qi’s tomb, and with her current strength she was simply far too weak to go out right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming slowly floated out from Primordius Heavenly Palace, landing on the black stone altar. He looked towards the characters that were carved onto the black stone altar, ‘Blue Throne Bai Qi’, and deeply bowed, gripping his fists together. “Senior Bai Qi, this junior was helplessly forced today, thus I was only able to lure the enemy here to engage in a life or death battle. I hadn’t known before that this was Senior’s tomb, so I apologize for any offense that I committed. Within a thousand years, junior will surely reenter this land and repair this array formation for Senior so that it is even stronger than before and Senior may rest in peace for billions of years more.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming didn’t know why Blue Throne Bai Qi was buried here. In the end, he could only say that it was his own fault for having disturbed Bai Qi’s tomb. The only way he could compensate for this was to repair the array formation in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Unfortunately, I have no idea what Senior Bai Qi’s last wish was, otherwise I could have helped him accomplish it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, Bai Qi could have been said to have given Lin Ming a life saving grace. With Lin Ming’s personality, he didn’t like owing favors to anyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After bowing to Bai Qi, Lin Ming turned to Ash Murder. He didn’t walk over first but instead used his avatar to investigate. After making sure that Ash Murder was completely dead, only then did he walk over himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming had thoroughly and completely won this battle.</span></p>

A playful smile graced his lips. His avatar lifted up his foot and then stomped down, brutally crushing Ash Murder’s left hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Kacha!</span></p>

And on Ash Murder’s middle finger, the spatial ring that had lost the protection of its master’s energy exploded into pieces.</span></p>

A massive amount of pills, weapons, armor, and talismans were thrown out. With a miserable cry, a distressed saint youth was flung out too.</span></p>

His injuries were extremely heavy. Although he was able to rely on his powerful mortal body to slowly restore himself, he hadn’t been able to recover much. He only had 10-20% of his original combat strength remaining.</span></p>

Afterwards, Lin Ming had followed up his attack, wanting to sever Naqi’s life. But just as Lin Ming was about to do so, Ash Murder had stuck his hand in and rescued Naqi, placing Naqi into his spatial ring.</span></p>

He had wounds added atop his previous wounds. Within the spatial ring, he had been meditating, restoring himself. But then with the sudden rupture of the spatial ring, a ruinous space storm had formed and sucked him in. if Naqi was in his peak condition then a space storm of this degree wouldn’t have been anything to him. But Naqi had been in deep meditation to recover from his wounds. He should have had someone guarding him so that no one was able to disturb him, and now that he was swept into the space storm he actually suffered a grievous backlash.</span></p>

After Naqi entered the spatial ring he had completely invested his focus into meditating, wanting to restore himself just that much faster. Only then would he be safe again. But now, he had been tossed out by Lin Ming onto the floor, unable to even tell what direction was what.</span></p>

He grasped his halberd and pointed it towards Lin Ming. Facing Lin Ming, his eyes gleamed with killing intent, his entire body on high alert.</span></p>

This sort of pity and faint contempt stoked a furious rage in Naqi’s heart.</span></p>

The energy path left behind by his fingers formed a spinning gray wheel.

This gray wheel slashed down at Imperial Prince Naqi.</span></p>
