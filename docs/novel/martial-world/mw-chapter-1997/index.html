They hoped to find ruins at the Holy Lord level or above, or perhaps even find some incomplete cultivation methods that would allow them to break into a higher realm.</span></p>

The famous mystic realms of the Divine Realm were long since controlled by the saints, and wanting to find a land of inheritance in the open wilderness was as difficult as looking for a needle in a haystack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, with this great mountain in front of them, even in their entire lives they wouldn’t be able to ascend the base of the mountain.</span></p>

Even if they desperately fought in the wild, recklessly journeying out to search for lucky chances, even if they used every waking moment of their lives to meditate, they still wouldn’t be able to escape the shackles of their fate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These shackles were like a great cage, and they were animals raised in this cage.</span></p>

In the end, all they obtained was an unchangeable truth and a body that gradually died from old age...</span></p>

The unlucky ones died in the wilderness, their bodies eventually turned to dust until no sign of them was left remaining in this world.</span></p>

But in the 3000 great worlds of the Divine Realm, there were innumerable organizations like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the greatest influence that humanity could form under their present situation, an influence that could fuel their hopes and dreams.</span></p>

This obsession had carved itself into their very beings, flowing with their life and sharing a destiny with them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Humans were creatures that were easily affected by those who surrounded them.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In this situation, Lin Ming saw some old people within the Heaven and Earth Alliance that left a deep impression on him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some of these old people diligently struggled all their lives and yet weren’t able to accomplish anything. Sometimes, they didn’t even manage to break into the Divine Transformation realm, their hearts filled with sorrow and unwillingness as they left the mortal coil alone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But there were some old people that before their death, would call a junior to their side and give voice to all their grief and indignation. They would pass on their hopes and wishes, saying words such as ‘when our people in the wild universe return to the Divine Realm in glory, do not forget the sacrifices of your ancestors.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, these two types of old men weren’t the ones that left the deepest impression upon Lin Ming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ones Lin Ming couldn’t forget the most were a third kind. These people had entered the Heaven and Earth Alliance during their youth. They ventured out again and again, searching for lucky chances, and then secluding themselves to bitterly cultivate. Even when old age arrived and they still didn’t have any achievements, they never gave up on the hope that burned in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They took out some fragmented map pieces from ancient books and carefully compared them. Then, betting everything on this faint hope, they spent the last years of their lives exploring the universe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They earnestly prepared for this journey, but in truth, all they had were some ordinary weapons, pots of wine, and some inferior medicines. They called on several of their companions and then strode forwards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But in truth, they had already passed the age where they could soar into the skies. Even if they really did find some ancient ruins, it wouldn’t be too beneficial to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Still, they continued moving forwards, welcoming the winds and rain, welcoming the slowly falling sun, firmly climbing up that planet-sized mountain peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a journey that they didn’t regret.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps outsiders wouldn’t be able to understand their reason for doing so. The end was already decided for them and all their futile efforts only served to stand in stark contrast to the work and energy they put into it. It was hard to imagine just what meaning there was in continuing to explore the world when they were at the twilight of their years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Lin Ming knew that when they reached this step, what they chased was not a chance to become a stronger powerhouse; what they chased was a belief. When they died, this belief would allow them to confidently say, ‘in order to resist destiny, I struggled with everything I had’.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When six hours passed, Lin Ming watched as those youths who had just become disciples of the Heaven and Earth Alliance finished their trip into the Heavenly Sutra Pavilion. He continued to quietly drink his wine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had a premonition that he wouldn’t be able to stay here much longer. He wouldn’t be able to watch these youths continue to age.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Lin Ming had stayed in this quiet corner of the universe for these past years and hadn’t heard of anything important occurring between humanity and the saints, he had a feeling that surged within him telling him that something would happen soon, something that would change the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reasoning behind this feeling was impossible to explain. It was a feeling that those with a great destiny felt, when they were so immersed in karmic ties that they unconsciously deduced cause and effect and were able to sense upcoming disasters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming sat in meditation, tranquilly waiting for the eve of this storm to arrive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soon, he planned to break into the half-step Empyrean realm that he had suppressed for far too long already. At the same time, he would open up another Dao Palace and also have the little black dragon grow to a thousand miles in length, having it become a half-grown adult…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He could not avoid the surging waves of the world, even if he didn’t yet possess the ability to resist the Good Fortune Saint Sovereign.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He wouldn’t sit idly by and do nothing again. In this next wave, humanity truly might be completely destroyed…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming slowly opened his eyes. The first sight that greeted him was a young girl.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This young girl was an excellent talent in Lin Ming’s eyes. If the world was returned to the peaceful era of 6000 years ago, she possessed the ability to become a peak Holy Lord. And if she had resources, she would even have a chance of becoming a World King. This was an Empyrean descendant level of talent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But what a pity. The reality was that the saints would not allow her to grow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming had paid attention to this young girl. It wasn’t just because of her talent, but because her last name was Yan. This young girl came from the Ancient Phoenix Clan and was acquainted with Lin Ming. 6000 years ago, a girl called Yan Littlemoon appeared within the Yan Family. When Lin Ming travelled to Fire Spirit Star and the God Beast Mystic Realm in the past, he had worked with Yan Littlemoon for some time. There was karma that tied them together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This young girl was called Yan Ke’er. When the Ancient Phoenix Clan collapsed, the remnant lineages of the Ancient Phoenix Clan still retained a small amount of Ancient Phoenix blood. After Yan Ke’er was born, the Yan Family sensed her great talent and poured into her body the limited Ancient Phoenix blood they had left.</span></p>

But in the current era, this was the most precious treasure that the Ancient Phoenix Clan’s remnant lineages could bring out.</span></p>

I studied it for several months and obtained great harvests from it. I am now confident that I will be able to perfectly break into Life Destruction, and in the future I might even be able to complete the full nine stages of Life Destruction, forming a six mile or even nine mile origin energy cloud…”</span></p>

But as Lin Ming heard this, he sighed. The geniuses of humanity had been reduced to a point where just a nine mile origin energy cloud ninth stage Life Destruction was considered amazing…</span></p>

He could see from her shy and timid expression that the reason she came here today was to thank him and also ask him to help her choose a cultivation method as well as discuss some problems she had with her training.</span></p>

When she was just a dozen some years old, she had met Lin Ming. This High Master had given her a great deal of advice. Many times, the seemingly insignificant pieces of advice left her perceiving them for many days whereupon she would end up greatly benefiting from them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As she grew stronger, she felt more and more that this High Master was someone with a long story behind him, and his strength was also a mystery.</span></p>

However, the Elder couldn’t detect anything unusual about Lin Ming. According to his inner world, he was only at the early Divine Transformation realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In addition, he had been able to look up the time at which Lin Ming had entered the Heaven and Earth Alliance. They were able to track his growth from the time he was a youth until present. It was hard for anyone to think he was actually some peak master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But even so, Yan Ke’er still stubbornly believed that Lin Ming was hiding his depths. From the outside, he looked like a lazy and melancholic individual, and the people of the Heaven and Earth Alliance also thought this. But, Yan Ke’er could faintly feel that the reasoning behind his attitude had to do with his hidden story.</span></p>

But, this guess even shocked her. She shook her head, unable to believe it. It would have been far too strange.</span></p>

The advice he gave her was far more useful than any teachings of the Yan Family Elders.</span></p>

The saints could freely plunder anything they wished from humanity, including even the virginity of young human girls.</span></p>

In a situation where they didn’t have the ability to protect themselves, it was easy for the saints to capture them and use them as living furnaces. But if they grew strong enough that they could kill some minor juniors of the saint race, then this would draw the attention of even stronger saint martial artists. This was because the stronger a woman was, the greater the advantages that could be obtained from them. Thus, their situations only became worse!</span></p>

Once they were discovered, their fates would be miserable.</span></p>

Even if you know the fate that possibly awaits you in the future, will you still choose to become a powerhouse?” Lin Ming clearly and unhurriedly asked as his eyes turned towards Yan Ke’er.</span></p>
