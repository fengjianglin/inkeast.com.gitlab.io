Lin Ming looked back to see several men and women wearing feather robes with star crowns on their heads. They were surrounding a young man wearing a dragon crown with his hair hanging loose around him. This young man stood atop the head of a silver python that was as large as a mountain. The silver python twisted as it moved forwards, leaving deep gullies in the earth.</span></p>

It was said that if this silver python was able to grow four feet and grow horns atop its head, it would evolve into a silver dragon. Of course, the road to that path was beset with difficulties and the chances of it happening were impossibly low.</span></p>

Brilliant waves of flames rolled up in the skies as a massive phoenix-looking firebird appeared. Just by flying, this firebird filled the skies with raging flames, immediately causing the temperature of the surroundings to become boiling hot.</span></p>

I must thank the Crown Prince for worrying over me. When I arrived I was indeed frightened miserable. Luckily, I managed to somehow stumble my way over here. How could I compare to someone as peerlessly wise and skilled as Crown Prince your highness? You could likely lay down on the floor and still arrive here. Ah, that’s right, at this Gate of Laws, does the peerlessly wise and skilled Crown Prince plan on challenging the heaven-step difficulty level?” Bigflame’s words were kind and subservient, but if one wasn’t an idiot they could clearly hear the taunting within them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Divine Void Crown Prince frowned as he heard these words.</span></p>

Before this, all trial challengers were placed together and could pass levels in groups. But at the Gate of Laws, every person would be separated and also had to choose their difficulty.</span></p>

Just partially completing it and surviving through the end was an extraordinary result!</span></p>

He estimated that if he chose the heaven-step difficulty, the most he could do was just barely pass it or only complete a small percentage of it.</span></p>

Moreover, he would also have to risk a high chance of dying there. Who would be willing to do something so stupid?</span></p>

The Divine Void Crown Prince wasn’t an idiot so why would he fall for such an obvious ploy?</span></p>

I naturally do not have the skill to challenge the heaven-step difficulty, but I am more than capable of playing in the earth-step difficulty. If Brother Bigflame is so proud of your own skills, then you should certainly try the heaven-step difficulty yourself, haha!”</span></p>

At this time, before the Gate of Laws, many disciples of large influences had gathered and they were all looking at him.</span></p>

Now, in front of the Gate of Laws, they were still stood in sharp opposition!</span></p>

In front of her, he didn’t show any arrogance at all. He had already witnessed the attitude with which Soul Emperor Divine Void had treated her.</span></p>

As a saint from the Asura Road, he wouldn’t be sucked up into their affairs. Even so, it was likely that this Sheng Mei didn’t have any good impressions of him at all. It was best to hide away as much as possible.</span></p>

Haven’t you heard that several years ago in the Divine Void Divine Kingdom, there was a grown Ice Phoenix that descended upon their land, even forcing Soul Emperor Divine Void out of his seclusion? And that woman is the person who arrived on that Ice Phoenix! She is the one who holds the record for the highest completion percentage, 83%! I heard that for these last several years she has been staying at Divine Void Divine Kingdom and her status is on par with that of Soul Emperor Divine Void!”</span></p>

This… the record of the highest completion percentage? Isn’t she the one that already obtained a completion rate of 83%? Why would she come to the Asura Road’s final trial again? Isn’t that just a waste of qualifications?”</span></p>

The Asura Road was simply far too large. Even if Sheng Mei had caused a giant stir in Divine Void Divine Kingdom, many people still hadn’t heard of her.</span></p>

He began to whisper in a cryptic tone, “If she came again, then she naturally believes 83% is not her limit! This mysterious spiritas woman has an extremely unique cultivation method, one that makes her talent grow stronger and stronger. She has already surpassed all common logic!”</span></p>

Moreover, this blue-clothed woman’s cultivation is far too confusing. Some people say she is an early Empyrean and some people say she is an ordinary World King; it's as if her cultivation is always changing. But, one point is for certain is that whether she is an Empyrean or World King, she can easily pinch us to death without any effort at all. Although we are standing here with her, the truth is that we are on completely different levels. In her eyes, we are nothing more than ants!”</span></p>

Everyone here was a proud child of the heavens. In their own large sects and families, they were heroic figures that stood at the peak of their generation. But here, they were actually considered to be no more than ants. No matter what, this left them feeling uncomfortable.</span></p>

This spiritas woman stood on par with Soul Emperor Divine Void, with no inferiority or superiority between them. And, Soul Emperor Divine Void was a True Divinity supreme elder. As for the rest of them, they already considered it the highest honor to have an Empyrean praise them a few times. The disparity between them could be imagined!</span></p>
