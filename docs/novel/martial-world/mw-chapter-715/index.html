 <p><strong>Chapter 715 – King Level Smelting Trial</strong></p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>Facing Xuan Yuqie’s mocking taunts, the Turquoise-Eyed Ape Clan Patriarch grew angry with shame. He had made a joke of the South Sea Demon Region at the start, but now it was Xuan Yuqie’s turn to ridicule him.</p>
 <p>The Turquoise-Eyed Ape Clan Patriarch coldly snorted and told the others behind him, “We are immediately returning!”</p>
 <p>The Turquoise-Eyed Ape Clan was no stronger than the South Sea Demon Region. However, the South Sea Demon Region was a sect. If their disciples died, they could always recruit more. As for the Turquoise-Eyed Ape Clan, they had limited numbers. For every clansman that died, it was impossible for to come up with more numbers at a fast speed. If Lin Ming was killing the outstanding elites of the Turquoise-Eyed Ape Clan, then the Turquoise-Eyed Ape Clan Patriarch couldn’t just sit idly and do nothing.</p>
 <p>He had to return. Otherwise,&nbsp; if Lin Ming came back and used his strange tracking ability, then he could kill dozens of Revolving Core martial artists at the very least. This was not a loss that their clan could afford.</p>
 <p>“Patriarch, are you planning to withdraw?”</p>
 <p>Xuan Wuji frowned. If the Turquoise-Eyed Ape Clan withdrew from here, that meant he would lose a powerful ally. With him alone, it would be extremely difficult to deter the Giant Leviathan in any way.</p>
 <p>Hearing Xuan Wuji’s question, the Turquoise-Eyed Ape Clan Patriarch’s face stiffened. “Elder Xuan, my apologies, but this King must return.”</p>
 <p>“Oh? You have to go back?” Xuan Yuqie sneered. “Ape King, wasn’t it you who said that a real man had to make choices? All of those fleeing clansmen are definitely worthless rejects. Since that’s the case, the disaster of your Turquoise-Eyed Ape Clan is also a great fortune! Those who leave are disloyal, but those who remain are the extraordinary elites. At that time, you can use the remaining members to rebuild your foundation; reforming your clan shouldn’t be difficult at all. Our South Sea Demon Region will also support you with everything we have! What do you think about this?”</p>
 <p>One of the world’s most humiliating matters was having your words tossed back in your face. Xuan Yuqie had deliberated copied the tone of the Ape King, leaving him speechless.</p>
 <p>“Humph! You were speaking so much bullshit in such a rude manner, and now that you’re the one in trouble, you decided to leave. How laughable!” Xuan Yuqie mercilessly mocked. Seeing the Turquoise-Eyed Ape Clan Patriarch suddenly deflate, Xuan Yuqie was very happy.</p>
 <p>As for Xuan Wuji, he simply glowered, a cold light flashing in his eyes. He stayed silent. Lin Ming was much more troublesome than he had anticipated.</p>
 <p>The Turquoise-Eyed Ape Clan Patriarch also didn’t speak any further. He simply cupped his hands and left. Now, the only ones left were Xuan Yuqie and Xuan Wuji.</p>
 <p>Xuan Yuqie lightly exhaled. She carefully looked at Xuan Wuji, whispering, “Elder Xuan, should we…”</p>
 <p>She hoped with every fiber of her body that Xuan Wuji would decide to return to the South Sea Demon Region and further consider matters. However, Xuan Wuji’s response left her disappointed.</p>
 <p>“You return first. If anything else pops up then use a water sound transmitting talisman to inform me.”</p>
 <p>Xuan Yuqie’s heart sank. She knew that saying anything else now would be useless. She could only reply in a quiet voice, “Yes, I understand…”</p>
 <p>To Xuan Wuji, his future breakthrough to the Divine Sea boundary was much more important than the fate of the entire South Sea Demon Region. He had absolute certainty that there was a great secret regarding Lin Ming’s body. Otherwise, it would be impossible for him to make such frightening progress.</p>
 <p>Xuan Wuji had already looked up Lin Ming and studied his background. Before fifteen years of age, Lin Ming had been nothing but the most average of youngsters. But, after he had reached fifteen years of age, he had suddenly soared into the heavens. In a mere six short years, he had gone from the first level of body transformation to being able to kill a second stage Life Destruction powerhouse. Within the entire Sky Spill Continent, this was an absolutely unprecedented event!</p>
 <p>To deal with such a person, Xuan Wuji could only attempt it before he grew anymore than this.</p>
 <p>In Xuan Wuji’s eyes, Lin Ming was a resolute individual who killed with decisiveness. He had one weakness, and that was that he cared too much for the safety of his friends and family. This could be seen from when Lin Ming had gone to rescue Qin Xingxuan.</p>
 <p>Xuan Wuji had already taken this point into consideration, and that was why he clung so tightly to the Giant Leviathan. Those within were equal to his lifeblood. He believed that as long as he could capture Mu Qianyu and the others, then he could force Lin Ming to appear.</p>
 <p>“Lin Ming, no matter what secret you have, I will find it!” Xuan Wuji clenched his fists, his mouth curving up in a brutal smile.</p>
 <p>……….</p>
 <p>At that time, 200,000 miles away, at Divine Phoenix Island…</p>
 <p>After the South Sea Demon Region had looted Divine Phoenix Island, the entire land had become a dump.</p>
 <p>When Lin Ming returned to the Sky Spill Continent, he had rushed into Divine Phoenix Island, killing the Elder stationed there even as all the little minions fled away. Now, the entire Divine Phoenix Island was a lonely and desolate land.</p>
 <p>Nowadays, Divine Phoenix had become a gathering place for wild birds and beasts. They nested in the ruined buildings and the land was blighted with barren shrubs and the remnants of destruction. As the sea breeze blew over, the weeds swayed in the air, as if they were testifying to the once great magnificence of Divine Phoenix Island.</p>
 <p>Lin Ming took step by step through the abandoned land. In front of him was a dilapidated building. There, on the roof, a group of crows and seabirds fluttered about. Because Divine Phoenix Island was a spiritual land, the vegetation, birds, and beasts all grew and bred at an extremely fast pace.</p>
 <p>Passing through these broken buildings, Lin Ming came to an empty valley. He carefully extended his perception, exploring his entire surroundings. This valley was the most precious treasure of the entire Divine Phoenix Island… the Divine Phoenix Mystic Realm!</p>
 <p>This mystic realm had been left behind by the Ancient Phoenix Clan, and it was also the very source of Divine Phoenix Island’s spiritual vein. As for how long ago the Ancient Phoenix Clan had existed, how glorious they had been, what sort of magnificent history they’d had, or how powerful a martial arts civilization they’d had, all of this had long been lost to time. But, what Lin Ming was absolutely sure of was that the Ancient Phoenix Clan was in no way inferior to those from the Realm of the Gods. It was even possible that they had come here from the Realm of the Gods.</p>
 <p>“I wonder why the Ancient Phoenix Clan came to Sky Spill Continent. Did they ever come into contact with that mysterious existence within the Eternal Demon Abyss?” Lin Ming muttered to himself.</p>
 <p>He felt that that 100,000 years ago, the area in Sky Spill Continent’s history which was completely blank, there must have been some heaven-shaking secrets involved.</p>
 <p>Lin Ming shook his head, no longer thinking about this. Soon, he arrived at the array formation of the Divine Phoenix Mystic Realm.</p>
 <p>In the end, Xuan Wuji had not left the deep sea area. This decision hadn’t surprised Lin Ming. Xuan Wuji was an ambitious and cruel individual of the demonic path. Everything he had done or would ever do was in order to pursue greater strength. Even the South Sea Demon Region was one of Xuan Wuji’s many chess pieces to reach higher peaks of power.</p>
 <p>If the South Sea Demon Region would still be in its most prosperous state, then Xuan Wuji might care a little bit about it. But now, the current South Sea Demon Region was only a peak fourth-grade sect without Xuan Wuji. To him, it was simply nothing.</p>
 <p>If Xuan Wuji didn’t leave, then Lin Ming could only defeat him with his own strength.</p>
 <p>But now, he had just broken through to the middle Revolving Core realm and had also opened the second of the Eight Inner Hidden Gates. It would be extremely difficult to greatly increase his strength in a short period of time in order to deal with Xuan Wuji.</p>
 <p>In this sort of situation, Lin Ming had thought of the Divine Phoenix Mystic Realm.</p>
 <p>In a person’s life, they could only enter the Divine Phoenix Mystic Realm twice. The last time Lin Ming had entered, he had been thrust into the general level smelting trial, finally fully completing it.</p>
 <p>But this time, Lin Ming’s goal was clear. That was… the king level smelting trial!</p>
