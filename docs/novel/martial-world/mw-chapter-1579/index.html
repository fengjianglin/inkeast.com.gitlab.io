She raised her sword. With her slender figure combined with this sword, she gave off a fierce and swift feeling.</span></p>

But, this yellow-robed eunuch acted as if he didn’t see this sword at all. He sneered and said with his grating voice, “Imperial Concubine Moon, my actions are all under imperial decree. In order to prevent the escape of the suspects my methods were a bit extreme. I apologize if there was any disrespect.”</span></p>

In other words, she was Lord Snow’s subordinate.</span></p>

At the same time, she has given me the discretion to apprehend your henchmen however I please. This man and woman are clearly not part of the Imperial Palace. As for the reason for them being here, I cannot comment on it. Everything will be decided by the Empress!”</span></p>

Imperial Concubine Moon’s eyes turned cold, “Are you threatening me?”</span></p>

However, if Imperial Concubine Moon resists the decree then I can only send a sound transmission command to the chief imperial guard of the Imperial Palace, and have the imperial guard assist Imperial Concubine Moon in a trip to see the Empress!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Eunuch Sun spoke, the eunuch bodyguards behind him moved forwards, encircling Imperial Concubine Moon, Lin Ming, and Xiao Moxian within.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These eunuch bodyguards all traced their spatial rings, ready to fight at any moment!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although these eunuch bodyguards didn’t have a high cultivation, they were skilled in various battle arrays. Once they formed a battle array, their combat strength would increase. With the peak Holy Lord Eunuch Sun added in, this caused Blood Moon’s eyebrows to wrinkle. If she wasn’t injured then she wouldn’t fear these people at all, but now, if she were to fight, then she would quickly lose control of the situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And since she was within the palace, if she tried to resist the imperial decree then she would be in the wrong no matter how it was said. It would be impossible for her to rid herself of a charge of rebelling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not just that, but Eunuch Liang wasn’t in Full Moon Hall but at Lord Snow’s palace. This current situation was extremely bad.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And as Blood Moon was finding it hard to back down, Lin Ming stepped forwards and said, “Since this is the summons of the Empress, we might as well take the trip over. It would be nice to meet the mother of the Marvel Blue Nation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming’s voice was slightly cold. Eunuch Sun chuckled. Was this boy an idiot? Just what use was there for Lord Snow or Imperial Concubine Moon to raise such a person? In this situation, this young man would actually speak such foolish words. Meet the Empress? What would the Empress want to meet him for?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In his imperial palace, the words of the Empress were the will of heaven; no one could defy them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After listening to Lin Ming, Blood Moon was at a loss for what to do. She knew that it would be difficult for today’s matters to not end in death, but she never imagined that Lin Ming would also become involved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ve even dragged you into this…” Blood Moon said with a sound transmission, her voice a bit helpless. “If the Empress has summoned us then I’m afraid she’s going to harm us. She will casually come up with some charges to get rid of us. Now that we’re in the imperial palace our situation is extremely bad. I’ve already contacted Eunuch Liang, but just the help of a chief eunuch like Eunuch Liang will not be able to help us too much. If you wish to guarantee your own safety then you’ll need to find some way to contact your master…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In Blood Moon’s opinion, Lin Ming’s master should have left him some life-saving card. Hopefully, Lin Ming would be able to rely on this to safely retreat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But, she didn’t think that Lin Ming would only shake his head and say, “When I left my master, it was to adventure alone. It is no longer possible for me to rely on his help. I must do everything by myself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming’s words left Blood Moon’s heart sinking with disappointment. If Lin Ming didn’t have the backing of his master then where did his bravado come from?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She wanted to give Lin Ming a few words of warning but she had no idea what to say. At this time, nothing she said would be useful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Like this, the team of eunuch bodyguards sandwiched Lin Ming, Imperial Concubine Moon, Xiao Moxian, and everyone else between them, leading them towards the central palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even the young maid that delivered water, Imperial Concubine Moon’s maids, and the young eunuchs had been led away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Marvel Blue Imperial Palace was extremely large and the group was walking at the same pace that mortals would walk at. Even though their destination was only 10 or so miles away, it still took them two to three quarter hours!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Along the way they passed through many corridors and palaces. Everything was quiet around them. Occasionally, squads of eunuchs patrolled around, filling the air with a chilling atmosphere!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing this imperial palace that had absolutely no lively or busy atmosphere at all, Lin Ming’s thoughts stirred. It seemed that the Empress really was working to clean out the harem. She was taking advantage of the Marvel Blue Emperor’s closed door seclusion to take all authority in her hands and eliminate her enemies!</span></p>

In the entire harem, besides the Soul Nourishing Temple that the Marvel Blue Emperor would stay at, Arid Peace Palace was the grandest construction.</span></p>

The pillars of the palace were crafted from blue snow gold and even the tiles were specially processed, each one supported by divine runic symbols. When these floor tiles joined together, they formed an array formation. As one walked atop these tiles, they could feel their blood vitality restlessly moving as it was stirred up by the array formation.</span></p>

A massive number of eunuch bodyguards were set up in full combat formations. This type of feeling was as if an all-encompassing net had been laid down, just waiting for Imperial Concubine Moon to enter!</span></p>

The eunuch bodyguards lowered Imperial Concubine Moon’s palanquin. Imperial Concubine Moon parted the silk screen and stepped out. As she looked at the situation around Arid Peace Palace, she sneered.</span></p>

There were a total of ten pillars, each of them looking grand. And in the center of the hall was a regal woman. She wore a golden red phoenix gown, each strand of silk spun from blue snow gold. It was resistant to water and fire, and even sabers and swords would find it difficult to slash through. It was a priceless garment.</span></p>

This Empress had the appearance of a 30 year old. When Lin Ming had left the imperial palace he had also inquired into some information about the Empress.</span></p>

At that time, she had been the proudest daughter of heaven within the Marvel Blue Nation. Her talent was outstanding and she had a variation bloodline. Moreover, her appearance was fantastic too.</span></p>

In the end, Naye had been the one to emerge as champion. She had earned the attention and praise of the Marvel Blue Emperor and had entered the imperial palace afterwards. Along the way, she gained more and more favor, her rank increasing until she was finally titled as the Empress.</span></p>

Moreover, dual cultivating with Naye was helpful to his own cultivation.</span></p>

However, she still wasn’t able to break through the World King realm and remained stranded as a half-step World King.</span></p>

The World King realm was simply far too difficult to reach. Even though Marvel Blue Nation was considered a Great World King Holy Land, they only had three or four World Kings within their lands.</span></p>

In the past, within the Divine Realm, there were some Great World King Holy Lands like the True Martial Holy Lands who only had a single World King leading their sect. 50,000 years ago, the Verdant Feather Holy Lands had also been a Great World King Holy Land but their Holy Land only had two World Kings, one of them Tian Mingzi and the other one the old Verdant Feather World King. If they had more World Kings then the Verdant Feather Holy Lands wouldn’t have suffered such a miserable fate after Tian Mingzi’s betrayal so many years ago.</span></p>

Besides the old Emperor who was a Great World King, there were three other World Kings.</span></p>

He was not only a World King but also a sixth-grade divine runic master. Within the Marvel Blue Nation he was a highly respected and noble character!</span></p>

He had been bestowed the title of grand duke and was highly beloved by the people.</span></p>

He was someone that had cultivated the Sunflower Melody to the eighth level! Although he was a court eunuch, the truth was that he had a status equal to the Imperial Scholar.</span></p>

As for Chief Eunuch Wei, he was only loyal to the Marvel Blue Emperor and also maintained neutrality in the struggle for succession. Even though Lord Snow and Lord Shen had done everything in their power to try to win over Eunuch Wei, even delivering to him all sorts of heavenly materials, Eunuch Wei had refused all offers and had returned all gifts.</span></p>

He wanted the three World Kings of the Marvel Blue Nation to all remain neutral in the struggle for succession and finally dedicate their lives to the winner.</span></p>

These three World Kings were the cornerstones of the Marvel Blue Nation. As long as they weren’t involved in the struggle then the foundation of the Marvel Blue Nation wouldn’t be affected.</span></p>
