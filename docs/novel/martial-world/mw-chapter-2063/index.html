This action wasn’t because he looked down on Lin Ming, but because this was the initial battle stance of the True Divinity cultivation method that Astral Vault God King trained in – the Astral Vault Saint Body. When his arms were crossed together, while it didn’t seem that his movements could be fast, the truth was that this stance unified the astral essence within his body and formed a type of potential.</span></p>

He flew high in the air, his hand extended diagonally, pointing the spear point down towards the void. His eyes were closed as he locked onto the surrounding space with his divine sense. To a martial artist on the level of Lin Ming, there was no difference between opening and closes their eyes. However, closing his eyes allowed him to better calm his mind, forming a more perfect union within the universe of his body and the universe of the world.</span></p>

His movements were sudden and his speed immediately reached the peak!</span></p>

The Empyreans present also saw a flash as Astral Vault God King turned into a beam of light that hurtled forwards!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The potential that Astral Vault God King had gathered with the initial battle stance of the Astral Vault Saint Body was completely poured into this strike. And, what he attacked Lin Ming with was not the golden sword in his hand, but his fist!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, for someone like Astral Vault God King, his mortal body could already compare favorably with a True Divinity spirit treasure. There was no difference in striking power between his fist and sword!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The void collapsed. Space storms swept out and rolled forwards. These storms gathered together, merging with Astral Vault God King’s potential. At this moment it was like Lin Ming wasn’t facing a fist, but a falling star!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone held their breath. This was the disparity between a True Divinity and an Empyrean. Facing Astral Vault God King’s fist, nearly all of the Empyreans couldn’t help but think that his strike would be impossible to resist. This feeling was no different from a mortal facing landslides and tsunamis; it was impossible to struggle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And at this time, Lin Ming also moved. Like a Divine Dragon awaked from its slumber, his eyes flashed open!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming thrust out his spear, his strike colliding with Astral Vault God King’s fist.</span></p>

All that was left over was the great momentum formed within Astral Vault God King’s fist, smashing into Lin Ming’s Black Dragon Spear.</span></p>

The Black Dragon Spear whipped back to its straight form. Astral Vault God King and Lin Ming flew back several hundred miles before pausing in the void!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In this one strike, no one had been able to harm the other. But, many human martial artists had cold beads of sweat dripping down their foreheads. This Astral Vault God King was simply too terrifying. Although they didn’t know what rank Lin Ming’s black spear was, they faintly knew that it must be a True Divinity spirit treasure of the highest caliber. But, Astral Vault God King had actually used his fist to contend with this spear; just how powerful was his mortal body!?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Astral Vault God King’s fist had been injured, what followed was…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone looked towards Astral Vault God King and saw him wave his right hand. The bloodstains on his fist had solidified and the golden blood was being absorbed back through his skin. The wound on his hand regenerated at a visible speed and soon it disappeared altogether.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing such a frightening bodily recovery ability, the human martial artists present all felt weak at heart. This person possessed a mortal body with a dreadful defensive capability that could resist a True Divinity spirit treasure and also had a formidable regeneration ability; this was simply the perfect defense! For the human Empyreans present, even if this type of enemy were to stand still and allow them to strike him, they still wouldn’t be able to do anything to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Was this Astral Vault God King’s strength?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Indeed, there were no weaklings amongst those that were able to become a True Divinity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming narrowed his eyes and looked at Astral Vault God King’s right hand. He said in a soft voice, “So that’s how it is. In terms of mortal body intensity, you already far surpass the rank of a lower True Divinity…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every True Divinity had their own special skills. For instance, the spiritas’ Great Brahmic God King excelled in the aspect of the mind and spiritual sea. Empyrean Divine Dream had balanced her development of the essence gathering system and soul forging system and was able to show countless variations of styles, making it impossible for Astral Vault God King to do anything. Soaring Feather God King was also similar to Divine Dream. She was skilled in spiritual sea and illusions, and even had high attainments of the body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for Astral Vault God King, he cultivated his body only. To become a True Divinity with his body alone, he used a single cultivation system to resist the other two. From this, it could be seen just how great Astral Vault God King’s mortal bodily strength was. This sort of person had peerless talent in the body transformation system and he was someone who displayed this talent to the extreme!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My mortal body intensity actually goes beyond that of a True Divinity spirit treasure. But, True Divinity spirit treasures are simply objects. Destroying them, while not easy, can still be achieved. As for me, I am skilled in all sorts of cultivation methods and different skills. With my mortal body, once I pour in astral essence and revolve the Astral Vault Saint Body, the intensity of my body will increase by ten times! Your attacks are strong, but if you cannot break through my defenses then everything you try will be futile!”</span></p>

Even the human True Divinity Divine Dream wasn’t able to harm him and had only trapped him in her illusions.</span></p>

So what if Astral Vault’s mortal body was strong? His mortal body was also strong and it was also incredibly formidable. In particular, after opening another Dao Palace, what Lin Ming desired was to engage in frontal battle with a body transformation master!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that moment, six Dao Palaces opened within Lin Ming’s body! Behind him, nine brilliant stars appeared. Endless starlight poured into Lin Ming, merging into those six Dao Palaces!</span></p>

The Black Dragon Spear was a peak True Divinity spirit treasure, but if he couldn’t pour enough strength into it then its power would be greatly reduced.</span></p>

Ringing cries of a dragon howled out from the spear, resounding through the void into the vastness of space.</span></p>

Golden astral essence and silver starlight turned into a horrifying energy storm that swept outwards!</span></p>

But Lin Ming was actually no worse, completely able to keep up with Astral Vault God King’s speed!</span></p>

However, their striking power wasn’t exchanged as a price for this speed. In fact, every time they clashed, their strikes would cause an energy storm to sweep outwards. Each time a storm was born it would persist for a long time. From far away, it seemed as if the entire distant skies were covered with giant gold and silver vortexes!</span></p>

Great! Wonderful!” Astral Vault God King wildly roared. For him to laugh so recklessly in the midst of such fierce combat proved that he still had ample strength remaining.</span></p>

His body started to grow and a faint red glow covered his body. The mystical symbol that appeared between his eyebrows before showed once again; he had completed his bloodline body metamorphosis!</span></p>

Using the dark star’s terrifying gravity I tempered my own mortal body. After I truly broke into the realm of True Divinity, before I left, I used all of my strength to pull out a piece of matter from this dark star, a piece that was three inches wide, a foot long, and considerably thick. After I returned, I went into seclusion for another thousand years to use this dark star material to create a thin and long sword form. Using this sword form as the base, I cast an immense amount of golden gem demonic steel atop it, finally forging it into a heavy sword! I did not refine it nor did I carve any demonic runes on its surface. While this is a True Divinity spirit treasure it actually doesn’t have any supernatural abilities or array formations within. But, with its terrifying weight alone as well as its incredible hardness, it is the best weapon for me!”</span></p>
