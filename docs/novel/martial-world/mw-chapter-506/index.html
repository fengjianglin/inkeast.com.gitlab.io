 <p><span style>Chapter 506 – Your Thunder Soul Isn’t Too Bad</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, if he wanted to force Lin Ming to come out, the only way that it would happens was if Lin Ming was idiotic enough to do so. Mu Chihuo wasn’t absolutely sure that it would work, but at this time he refused to give up, and he also didn’t have any other way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mu Qingyi, hurry up and tell me what Lin Ming and Mu Qianyu’s sound transmission mark is!” Mu Chihuo waved his sword across Mu Qingyi’s neck, cutting a thin red line of blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Qingyi sneered, ignoring him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you don’t want to care for face… Mu Qingyi, it seems that you have a short memory. You’re right, if we can’t find Lin Ming then we’ll die. But, before we do so, there are still many matters that we can finish. For instance…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Mu Chihuo spoke, his eyes turned towards Mu Bingyun and flashed with cruelty, “Qingshu, haven’t you been frustrated lately? If you want, then… hehe…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mu Chihuo!” Mu Qingyi’s heart raged with anger and she grinded her teeth together. “You are less than an animal! If anyone dares to touch a single hair on Bingyun then I will burn my complete blood essence and sanity and die with them!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Qingyi’s eyes were bloodshot. As an early Revolving Core martial artist, if she used her life as the price and completely burned away her blood essence, then she would be able to gain strength to fight a middle Revolving Core martial artist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If she also ate a Scarlet Blood Pill during this time period, she would be even more formidable. Even someone like Mu Chihuo would have trouble dealing with her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“OId woman, if you know what’s good for you then hurry up and speak!” Lei Jingtian took a step forwards, his suppressing aura falling over Mu Qingyi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if Mu Qingyi burnt all of her blood essence, Lei Jingtian wouldn't</span><span style>&nbsp;fear her even a bit. All that Lei Jingtian thought about was the ancient Devil Tome in Lin Ming’s spatial ring, as well as the Blood Extinguishing Demon Thunder and whatever other secrets he might have.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Qingyi’s face flashed with a complex emotion. Finally, she told him Mu Qianyu’s sound transmission mark information. As for Lin Ming, she wasn’t on familiar terms with him, so she didn’t know. But Zhang Zhen actually knew, as he one of Lin Ming’s good friends.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zhang Zhen… Lin Ming’s sound transmission mark… please give it.” Mu Qingyi’s eyes were filled with a deep guilt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhang Zhen bit his teeth. At this time it wasn’t just Mu Bingyun in danger, but also his grandfather, the Seventh Elder, was in the enemies’ hands. He simply had no other choice. His lips moved, and Zhang Zhen gave away Lin Ming’s sound transmission mark information.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The truth was that he had already expected what Mu Chihuo was about to do. He could only hope that Lin Ming would not be swayed by things like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Humph, you stupid boy, if you knew it then you should have spoken earlier.” Because Mu Qingshu couldn’t find Lin Ming, he was fuming with anger. He punched Zhang Zhen in the stomach, and Zhang Zhen folded onto the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qingshu, don’t cause needless complications. Finding Lin Ming is the most important matter.” Mu Chihuo took out two sound transmitting talismans. In this broken world, sound transmitting talismans were suppressed by the laws of this world. They could also be blocked by enchantments, array formations, and all sorts of other barriers. Mu Chihuo pegged his hopes on the possibility that Lin Ming wasn’t too far from them, and that there also wasn’t a barrier blocking the sound transmitting talisman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chihuo flicked his fingers and the two sound transmitting talismans burned. “Lin Ming, Mu Qianyu, I know that you two are together. Listen to me now. Mu Qianyu, I have your little sister as hostage. If you don’t want her to be violated, then show up together with Lin Ming within 10 hours. If you don’t, I will let others ravage Mu Bingyun. Not just that, but for every hour that you don’t appear, I will kill one person!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Mu Chihuo spoke, even he felt that his threat towards Lin Ming was a bit weak. But, at this time he could only hope that Lin Ming was an idiot that came forwards to die of his own volition.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qingshu, start the time!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whether or not Lin Ming came out, Mu Chihuo would do as he said. He already had no scruples or honor, and if he didn’t kill Lin Ming, then he would be the one to die.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Qingshu took out a foot high hourglass from his spatial ring and placed it atop the platform. The grains of sand within the hourglass slowly drifted downwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As time slowly passed, the sand at the top of the hourglass drained away. Then, Mu Qingshu turned the hourglass. This hourglass was enough to measure one hour.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Mu Qingshu turned over the hourglass, he looked over at Mu Bingyun, his eyes flashing with a hideously lascivious light. At this stage, Mu Qingshu had already gone completely insane; he no longer cared about any consequences.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the sand ran out, he turned over the hourglass again. Like this, two hours had passed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Qingyi’s heart was in chaos. Zhang Zhen also felt like an ant in a hot pot. But as for Mu Bingyun, she was expressionless as she sat down in meditation, saving her strength for the final battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Bingyun was well aware that whether Lin Ming and Mu Qianyu came back or not, fighting was inevitable. At that time, how many people would survive was unknown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Lei Jingtian really wished to be ruthless, the lower level martial artists wouldn’t even have the qualifications to escape. Even if everyone split up in separate directions and ran, all Lei Jingtian would have to do was send down a massive net of Disenchanting Dream Light, and every martial artist below the Revolving Core realm would instantly fall unconscious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the hourglass turned for the third time, the Divine Phoenix Island disciples grew increasingly nervous. In the face of a battle at death’s door, very few were able to remain calm like Mu Bingyun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the third hourglass was halfway finished, at the end of the temple ruins, the figure of a man and a woman suddenly appeared…</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Mu Chihuo saw this, he shot up. He couldn’t believe his eyes; they really came?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lei Jingtian was also shocked. His eyes swept past the two figures, and he immediately laughed. They were too stupid, he had never seen someone so stupid before! They had wasted so much energy and strained themselves to escape, but had actually returned to die just because they cared for others. They really were idiots of a completely different caliber.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But as for those from Divine Phoenix Island, as Mu Qingyi and Lin Ming saw Mu Qianyu appear, she was filled with guilt and regret. She already decided that as soon as the battle began, she would completely combust her blood essence and also swallow the Scarlet Blood Pill as penance for her sins.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Bingyun traced the spatial ring on her left hand. Her mind was already connected to the Blue Luan Sword; she was only waiting for the battle to begin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha! You are such an idiot!” Mu Qingshu savagely laughed, “You really came to die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Lin Ming came, then they had a chance to live. Even if they couldn’t obtain the first eight layers of the ‘Vermillion Bird Forbidden Divine Chronicle’, they would profit as long as they obtained his Divine Phoenix bloodline.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Lin Ming arrived 300 feet away, he stood firm and held the Great Desolate Blood Halberd in his hands. He was expressionless as he kept the halberd blade pointed at the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Beside Lin Ming, Mu Qianyu had taken out the Vermillion Bird Sword. A cool wind blew through her hair, making it dance in the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hahahahaha!” Lei Jingtian held the Thunder Light Sword in his hand and stepped forwards, “Lin Ming, although they say you are a genius, I only think you are a fool. You clearly knew that coming here meant death, but you still stepped into this trap. Since you’re such an idiot, let this old man help you along.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lei Jingtian’s arms shook, and purple electric light appeared atop his hands. This was the Disenchanting Dream Light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Lin Ming looked at Lei Jingtian’s Thunder Soul, he grinned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm? Why are you smiling?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m smiling because… I’m thinking your Thunder Soul isn’t too bad.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I do not need you to evaluate my Thunder Soul!” Lei Jingtian heard the implicit meaning behind Lin Ming’s words. He only felt extremely uncomfortable at Lin Ming’s confident appearance. This bastard, what sort of cards could he possibly be hiding?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mm?</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Lei Jingtian suddenly noticed Lin Ming’s cultivation. He was stunned. “You broke through to the Xiantian realm?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiantian?</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Lei Jingtian spoke, everyone else also noticed Lin Ming’s cultivation. He had truly entered the early Xiantian realm!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Qingyi’s eyes were wide and filled with disbelief. Even the usually calm and emotionless Mu Bingyun was stunned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming had gone from the late Houtian realm to the early Xiantian realm in just six days?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just what had happened in these past six days?</span></p>
 <p><span style>It must be unimaginable!</span></p>
 <p><span style>For a martial artist to reach the Xiantian realm before 18 years of age… this was already beyond the scope of anyone’s understanding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Such cultivation and such strength at such a tender age!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Throughout the entire Sky Spill Continent, an achievement of this degree might be unprecedented in the last tens of thousands of years. This might never have happened from the ancient times until now!</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, everyone was stunned into silence. Lei Jingtian also felt a deep fear stirring in him. Lin Ming was just too terrifying, terrifying enough to make everyone afraid to give him time to grow!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So that’s how it is. You have the confidence to return just because you reached the Xiantian realm. What are you planning on doing? Do you think you can fight me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lei Jingtian sneered and stepped forwards, pointing the Thunder Light Sword at Lin Ming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prior to this, when Lin Ming had combusted his blood essence, he had gained strength at the limit of an early Revolving Core master; he had still been far from reaching a middle Revolving Core master’s strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But having broken through to the Xiantian realm from the late Houtian realm, his strength had risen by two boundaries.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Logically speaking, in the path of martial arts, the disparity in gaps of cultivation increased the further one went. The difference between the late Houtian realm and Xiantian realm was much less than the difference between an early Revolving Core and late Revolving Core master.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Lei Jingtian also knew that Lin Ming could not be judged by common sense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lei Jingtian didn’t think he would lose, but he would still exercise the utmost caution.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Lei Jingtian and Lin Ming faced each other, Mu Qianyu calmly walked over to Mu Bingyun’s side. The two sisters, with the swords of ice and fire, faced Mu Chihuo together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for Mu Yanzhuo, he would be dealt with by Mu Qingyi and the Seventh Elder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, if Lei Jingtian wasn’t able to suppress Lin Ming, Mu Chihuo’s side would be at a great disadvantage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lin Ming, I admit that you have the ability to make me serious. In this broken world and under the suppression of these laws, I’ll have to be serious with you!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But in terms of strength, you still fall far short! Shaking Thunder Sword!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lei Jingtian’s sword cut forwards and his blade pierced forth. A deep purple electric light flashed, and the loud sound of thunder howled in the air!</span></p>
 <p><span style>In this first sword strike, Lei Jingtian was only testing Lin Ming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Lin Ming had no intention to follow along with this test. The corners of his lips curved up in a fiendish grin, and he connected his true essence to the Heretical God Seed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Heretical God Force – open!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The power of Tempering Marrow also completely erupted!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Great Desolate Blood Halberd turned. Lin Ming’s body emitted explosive crackling sounds. Above the Great Desolate Blood Halberd, 14 Blood Drinking Seals twisted into a crimson vortex.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Primeval Halberd Strike!</span></p>
 <p><em><span style>Kacha!</span></em></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming’s halberd thrust forwards as if it were able to twist space itself into pieces. Lei Jingtian’s Disenchanting Dream Light was completely swallowed by that crimson vortex. A powerful tearing force enveloped Lei Jingtian, twisting his life force and causing his blood to swell. Lei Jingtian immediately lost balance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lei Jingtian couldn’t believe his own eyes. The Blood Drinking Seals had broken through his sword energy and pierced through his protective true essence. A ribbon of fresh blood shot into the wind!</span></p>
