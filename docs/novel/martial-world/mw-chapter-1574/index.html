 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Above this ocean were countless islands. Some islands were several thousand miles large, and some had more surface area than a giant planet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Among these many islands, there was a large island with a 10,000 mile radius. This island was called Blue God Island.</span></p>

Most of it was vast tracts of lush forests.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And surrounded by these lush forests, there was a tropical nation filled with greenery. This nation was called Marvel Blue Nation and its capital was Marvel Blue City.</span></p>

This was because this area produced a type of resource called blue snow gold. Moreover, these verdant forests were also filled with ancient vicious beasts and all sorts of heavenly materials. Thus, although Marvel Blue Nation was situated in a vast ocean, most of the citizens were martial artists and it wasn’t strange to see amazing top masters here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although its quality and quantity of martial artists couldn’t compare to Divine Rune City, Marvel Blue City was still outstanding when compared to many major cities of the Divine Realm. The entire Marvel Blue Nation could be called a peak World King Holy Land.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On this day, a massive spirit boat anchored on the outskirts of Marvel Blue City. A young human man and woman leapt off the spirit boat. Then, the man received the spirit boat into his inner world.</span></p>

After Lin Ming obtained Blood Moon’s reply, he had journeyed west until he came to Marvel Blue City with Xiao Moxian. This city was where Blood Moon was located.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After arriving at this hot tropical island, the weather was extremely wet and humid. The martial artists here exuded an extremely deep and exotic atmosphere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most of the men wore hats tied down with cloth. They were shirtless or wore extremely short crop tops with loose pants and boots.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the women, they wore short, tight-fitting clothes with plunging necklines that proudly revealed their chests. They often wore bold leather skirts that revealed their slim waists and slender legs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some women with higher statuses had beautiful metal accessories hanging off of their faces and necks. These accessories were a metallic silver blue. This was the national resource of Marvel Blue Nation – blue snow gold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Lin Ming walked, he evaluated everything around him. Most of the martial artists walking outside were at the Divine Sea or Divine Transformation realm, and even Divine Lord realm martial artists weren’t rare. This level of strength was extremely exaggerated. In the Divine Realm, a Divine Transformation realm martial artist possessed the ability to freely travel through the universe, and a Divine Lord realm martial artist could be the ultimate ruler of a small planet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soon, Lin Ming arrived at the gates of Marvel Blue City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The tall city walls didn’t seem as if they had experienced many years. Rather, they had a very new feeling to them. It seemed that this Marvel Blue City wasn’t as ancient as Lin Ming had thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The city gates were manned by two teams of soldiers. After Lin Ming paid the city entrance fee, he stepped inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">According to the address that Old Su had given him, Lin Ming continued inquiring for directions along the way. Finally, he arrived in a small materials shop that seemed common and insignificant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within this materials shop were all sorts of materials required for the divine runic arts and alchemy. There were even furnaces, divine runic pens, and so forth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because these things weren’t too valuable, the shop seemed quite lonely and desolate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming only glanced over the shop a few times without the slightest desire to purchase anything. This was because he wasn’t here to buy materials to begin with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming quietly took off a spatial ring and stepped in front of the shopkeeper. This shopkeeper was a short and pudgy middle-aged man. His cultivation was ordinary and sloppy. If he were in a crowd, one wouldn’t notice him at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming traced the spatial ring and pulled out several dozen materials. Then, he said in a low voice, “I’m selling, this is a total of 1,263,400 origin energy runes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon hearing Lin Ming and seeing the materials that Lin Ming had taken out, the fat shopkeeper narrowed his eyes and looked deeply at Lin Ming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The materials that Lin Ming took out as well as his asking price were all a single code word for him to make a connection in Marvel Blue City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is your name?” The fat shopkeeper asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lin Ming.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mm… follow my person. He will bring you to the one you wish to see.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although this old man’s movements were slow, his eyes were sharp. As he walked across the tiles, his steps were steady to the point of being startling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Come with me!”</span></p>

It was hard to discern whether this was the voice of &nbsp;a man or a woman, and it was also quite harsh to the ears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Peak Holy Lord!”</span></p>

This old man actually possessed a peak Holy Lord cultivation, and he was even a human at that. In the Asura Road, humans were rare to begin with but in Marvel Blue Nation, over half the citizens were humans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming and Xiao Moxian followed this eagle-eyed old man out of the shop. From the body of this old man, Lin Ming could feel a surging essence energy. He raised his guard, remaining vigilant of his surroundings as he kept his focus on this eagle-eyed old man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They walked without speaking. The eagle-eyed old man brought Lin Ming meandering left and right, passing through busy streets and squares, slowly approaching the center of Marvel Blue City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Marvel Blue City covered an area of hundreds of miles and it was extremely broad. As for the center of Marvel Blue City, there was a massive and magnificent building complex! Now, Lin Ming was standing in front of this building complex.</span></p>

As Lin Ming saw this, he was shocked. This place… could it be…?</span></p>

Its sovereign was equivalent to sect masters of other large influences. This Imperial Palace was the core of Marvel Blue nation and could be called a den of crouching tigers and hidden dragons. There were many masters living in the Imperial Palace!</span></p>

Because Marvel Blue Nation was rich in great vicious beasts, medicinal herbs, and even the extremely valuable blue snow gold, the Marvel Blue Royal Family was extremely wealthy. Besides the masters in their court, there were many other elders and officers in their employ. In the event that a battle broke out, Marvel Blue Imperial Palace would have a terrifying combat strength.</span></p>

She said with a true essence sound transmission, “This old man is a court eunuch!?”</span></p>

After Tian Mingzi returned to the Skydark Holy Lands he had used secret techniques and heavenly materials to regenerate his severed hand. The only problem was that this hand had yet to be tempered so it was far inferior to his original hand.</span></p>

As for Eunuch Liang, who was walking in front, he seemed to guess what Lin Ming and Xiao Moxian were thinking of. He chuckled mysteriously and then said with a true essence sound transmission, “You two are dual cultivation companions, right?”</span></p>

However, while you may have heard of nourishing yin with yang and yang with yin, have you ever heard of locking in your essence energy to nourish yourself? In this world there are some martial arts where one must cut off their own manhood before one can cultivate them! Us eunuchs who sever our seven affections and six desires are perfectly suited to practice this type of martial arts! The average person must give vent to the physical temptations of the flesh, but for us, we can reverse this process, locking in our essence energy within our body. Slowly, our essence energy will accumulate, filling us with daily energy and bestowing upon us plentiful physical strength.</span></p>

Even on this road there are still transcendent divine mights! And in our Marvel Blue Imperial Palace, there are over 1200 eunuchs. What we practice is the Sunflower Melody, a transcendent divine might that was established by someone who castrated themselves and became an Empyrean!</span></p>

Indeed, the road of martial arts had extremely high standards and not everyone had the ability to cultivate. But, if one chose to cultivate the Sunflower Melody, the restrictions were far lower.</span></p>

For someone who cultivated the Sunflower Melody, if they ever developed the desire towards men and women and no longer wished to be a eunuch, they could restore themselves with heavenly materials but this would mean that all the martial arts they cultivated would be wasted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But in the legends, if one was able to practice the Sunflower Melody to the highest levels and reach the extreme Empyrean boundary then they could still regenerate their body and have their physical flesh reach perfection. But, this was far too distant a matter. For the average person, an Empyrean was nothing but a fairy tale.</span></p>
