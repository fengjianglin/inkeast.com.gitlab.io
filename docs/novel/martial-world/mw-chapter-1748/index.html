And just as they passed through the grand gates of Divine Dream Heavenly Palace, Lin Ming saw a blue-clothed woman hurriedly racing over. This woman had just received the news in her seclusion room and had rushed over to meet Lin Ming.</span></p>

Now, her appearance was considerably different from how she was 50,000 years ago.</span></p>

She froze where she was.</span></p>

All she worried about was whether Lin Ming had suffered heavy wounds or whether there were hidden injuries left in him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But, she never imagined that Lin Ming would return with a woman, and this woman was clearly her younger sister, Mo Brightmoon!</span></p>

Mo Brightmoon threw herself at her big sister, hugging her tightly as tears welled up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this time, there was no need for words. As the two sisters tightly held each other, it was as if their hearts and minds had already merged…</span></p>

Now all that was left was to rebuild the Verdant Feather Holy Lands.</span></p>

He followed the white-clothed woman to greet Empyrean Divine Dream.</span></p>

The moment this leafed door was opened, a shocking scene was revealed behind it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind this door was an incomparably vast world. Countless celestial mountains floated high above a sea of clouds. Lush green spirit plants grew everywhere, and even spiritual springs and rivers fell down from the mountains in waterfalls, cascading into the world like limitless threads of white silk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Among these numerous celestial mountains, there was a floating plain. This plain resembled a mountain that had its top half sheared off, revealing a completely smooth tract of land.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And above this plain, there was a simple bamboo house. Thick and luxurious grass grew tall with the natural fragrance of bamboo everywhere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming fell down in front of this bamboo house. As he did, he saw a white-clothed woman in front of it, gathering the nectar of flowers. Her appearance resembled that of a young woman in her twenties.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This nectar was condensed from rich heaven and earth origin energy and was also produced from these spiritual plants. To a martial artist, it was similar to milk from 10,000 year stalactites. This was immortal springs divine water, and whether it was for refining pills or drinking, it was extremely beneficial.</span></p>

Towards this leader of humanity in his eyes, Lin Ming had always held the deepest reverence and awe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Divine Dream looked at Lin Ming and smiled. She lightly said, “58 years, 6 months, and 12 days. You’ve finally returned…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Divine Dream calmly stated the exact duration of Lin Ming’s journey in the Asura Road, leaving him startled. Although an Empyrean had an extremely accurate memory, for her to speak out this time proved that she had been worried about his progress in the Asura Road smelting trial.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Half-step Holy Lord! Very good!”</span></p>

This degree of cultivation had surpassed her original estimations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Lin Ming first entered the Asura Road, he had only been at the middle Divine Transformation realm. Now, he had grown by an entire large realm and a half. Moreover, from glancing over Lin Ming’s inner world, she could see that his foundation was solid and his combat strength was definitely extraordinary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming responded, “Junior stumbled into a strange mystic realm in the Asura Road. Within, time flowed at a rate ten times faster than the outside. However, what was most mysterious was that although the flow of time was changed, the world Laws remained unaltered so that one could cultivate normally within. Junior stayed inside for 20 years, so in truth I have cultivated for 80 years. Adding onto the many fortuitous encounters and lucky chances I obtained, I managed to reach the half-step Holy Lord realm.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh? There is such a place?” Divine Dream was startled. To establish an independent space and change the flow of time, it was inevitable that the Laws would be twisted. She didn’t think that such a wonderfully strange land existed in the Asura Road.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“80 years to become a half-step Holy Lord is still more than astonishing. Lin Ming, through your adventures in the Asura Road, your harvests have truly been great this time. Your battle with the Good Fortune Saint Son that he agreed to was in 100 years so you still have more than 40 years remaining. You must focus on your training so that after the period of 100 years is over, there can be a battle to decide just who is stronger and who is weaker.”</span></p>

The saints had jeered at him, labeling him an idiot, and even the human Empyreans felt that Lin Ming had been too rash!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Empyrean Divine Dream also had her concerns and apprehensions about this matter. At that time, Lin Ming had only been at the Divine Transformation realm whereas the Good Fortune Saint Son was about to break into the Saint Lord realm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The disparity could be imagined!</span></p>

However during these 60 years, the Good Fortune Saint Son had also made considerable progress!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the reason why Empyrean Divine Dream had said these words so that Lin Ming would take advantage of the 40 years he had remaining and practice wholeheartedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In response to Empyrean Divine Dream’s words, Lin Ming remained quiet, not saying anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Empyrean Divine Dream continued, “Lin Ming, according to what I know, the Good Fortune Saint Son has also made great strides in his cultivation these past years. Do not forget – he has the Grandmist Spirit Bead.”</span></p>

As for the Magic Cube, it was a divine tool of the soul. Although the Magic Cube was also extremely beneficial to Lin Ming, it still couldn’t directly increase his cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the Good Fortune Saint Son, he could use the Grandmist Spirit Bead to temper his body!</span></p>

Lin Ming didn’t doubt that if the Good Fortune Saint Son were to return to the final trial, he would definitely surpass a completion rate of 81%.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was truly a formidable opponent.</span></p>

Not to mention the two heaven-defying lucky chances of the Asura blood and the Asura Heavenly Dao, just opening two of the Dao Palaces from the Nine Stars of the Dao Palace had increased Lin Ming’s true cultivation far past that of a half-step Holy Lord.</span></p>

The monster race has publicized this longevity feast throughout the world and I have also received a letter of invitation. If you do not have any other matters to attend to, then go together with me. This time, the ones that the monster race has invited are not just the demon race and human race…”</span></p>

This meant that with the monsters and saints, even if they hadn’t formed an alliance, their relationship wasn’t bad!</span></p>

I too want to take a look and see what the monster race is like.” Thinking like this, Lin Ming said, “Junior has no other matters to attend to. I may accompany Senior Divine Dream to go together.”</span></p>

For the Monster Emperor’s grand longevity feast, it is within reason for the Good Fortune Saint Son to be invited. Without accident, you will meet him there. If he tries to taunt you, you must not fall for his tricks and come into conflict with him. Remember, you still have around 42 years of time to prepare for your fated battle. Do not fall for his provocations. I have heard that the Good Fortune Saint Son has recently made an important breakthrough in his martial arts and has finally practiced the fifth level of the Good Fortune Divine Arts!”</span></p>
