 <p><span style>Chapter 1480 – Hunt</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the grand and rolling desert, strong winds cut like knives. The endless yellow sand buried the bones of strange and unusual beasts, looking bleak and desolate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This place seemed like a death trap, but as Lin Ming saw this scene he actually let out a sigh of relief. They had finally escaped the Paradise Reborn lands that they had fled into.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming only had a basic understanding of the dao field traces left behind by the Asura Road Master in the jade pendant. But, by using this little bit of knowledge he was able to emerge from Paradise Reborn. Moreover, by verifying the terrain with the jade pendant map, he obtained an even more profound understanding of the emperor jade.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I must say… Lin Ming.” Xiao Moxian smirked as she spoke, a playful tone in her voice. She had called Lin Ming by his true name and not Lin Lanjian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?” Lin Ming asked Xiao Moxian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah… how come you don’t have any reaction at all? Although your identity is already obvious, if I suddenly call you by your name shouldn’t you at least be shocked or surprised?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After suppressing it for such a long time, Xiao Moxian was finally able to tear down Lin Ming’s secret identity. She was originally anticipating seeing the surprise on his face; that would at least give her a little bit of a sense of accomplishment. However, Lin Ming’s reaction was far too calm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was like someone doing their best to correctly guess a riddle, but the riddler themself wasn’t affected at all. This made Xiao Moxian feel a bit unhappy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn’t you know a long time ago? Moreover… I already knew that you knew.” Lin Ming faintly smiled as he indifferently spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, that was boring.” Xia Moxian spread her arms wide in defeat. “What do you plan on doing next? Not only are you being chased down by a World King but you also have to face the perilous God Burying Ridge, a land of almost certain death. And, what is worse is that the World King and his group have guides to lead the way while we are like headless flies in this chaos. No matter how you look at it, we’re going to die without a doubt.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you knew you were going to die then why would you follow me?” Lin Ming said, smiling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I said that I owe you a life, and since I saw you about to die soon I thought I should lend you a hand, but… you seemed pretty confident so you must have a plan of some kind. Why don’t you tell me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming shook his head. “I have yet to think of a good plan. Frankly speaking, God Burying Ridge isn’t too threatening to me. The greatest threat is from that World King powerhouse chasing me down. Now, what I have to do first is to feel out the specifics of God Burying Ridge’s dao field and verify it with what I know in my heart. If I can familiarize myself with the environment here then I can control the landscape and the advantage. Only then will I have the ability to contend with a World King.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming casually said. But as Xiao Moxian heard this she was secretly surprised.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Without a guide to lead him through God Burying Ridge, Lin Ming actually said that God Burying Ridge didn’t pose too great a threat to him. Did he have something he could rely on?</span></p>
 <p><span style>What shocked Xiao Moxian the most was that Lin Ming said he wanted to familiarize himself with God Burying Ridge’s environment and use this advantage to contend with a World King. This was simply incomprehensible to her. If it weren’t for Lin Ming acknowledging his true identity just now, Xiao Moxian might have suspected he was someone else who had inherited the legacy of some God Burying Ridge guide.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Xiao Moxian was basking in her amazement, Lin Ming was searching the jade pendant with his sense, looking for a place where he could hide himself and prepare for a guerilla battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But at this time, Lin Ming suddenly felt a light sense wash over him, lasting for only the most fleeting moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This caused Lin Ming to be startled. Although this sense was incomparably vague, his intuition wasn’t wrong. Someone was using some arcane searching technique to find his location in God Burying Ridge!</span></p>
 <p><span style>In Heavendevil City there were innumerable martial artists. As long as he used an appearance changing technique there was no search technique that would have any effect on finding him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But now he was in God Burying Ridge, a land where there wasn’t anyone within 10,000 miles. As long as someone found him with their searching technique, regardless of whether or not he had changed his appearance, they would still find him. This other party clearly knew what happened to him after he entered God Burying Ridge and was looking for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ve been discovered!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming sucked in a deep breath. Without Lin Ming mentioning it, Xiao Moxian had also noticed that faint detection sense sweep over them just now. “If someone dares to recklessly use a searching technique like this in God Burying Ridge they must really not fear any evil beings they might draw in. It seems your guess was right; we really are being chased down by a World King powerhouse.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Moxian couldn’t smile at this time. They were stuck in a danger zone and also being hunted down by a World King!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Follow me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming turned towards a direction and used his movement technique, instantly launching forwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…………</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time several hundred miles away, Imperial Prince Naqi and his group of people were surrounded by a mob of ghosts, engaged in a fierce battle!</span></p>
 <p><span style>With the Spider Brothers to guide them and also force fields to hide them, Naqi and his group could have easily ventured deep into God Burying Ridge and obtained all sorts of treasures.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, as soon as they entered the inner ridge, Mister Zhou and the others had used all sorts of searching techniques like the Heaven Spying Art, making them shine like a lighthouse at night, This caused all of the surrounding evil beings to come hurtling towards them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How troublesome!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Naqi frowned as his halberd smashed through a corpse devil. With two World King level powerhouses present, there was no threat from these evil beings. Even so, this undoubtedly hindered their speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time from beside Naqi, Tian Mingzi suddenly said, “We should divide our group into two.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Naqi looked towards Tian Mingzi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is far too inefficient to search for them as we are now. If we split up it will be much quicker.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In their group they had two World Kings and their searching techniques overlapped to a great extent. If they could divide their group in half it would indeed be much faster.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Naqi and Mister Zhou looked at each other, and then Mister Zhou said, “Alright.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With Tian Mingzi’s Great World King cultivation he simply didn’t need a guide to walk through God Burying Ridge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A Great World King was only inferior to an Empyrean. Unless he ventured into the few absolute death zones in God Burying Ridge, there was nothing here that was a threat to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, the premise for all this was that they didn’t enter Tragic Death Valley. Tragic Death Valley was a place where even Empyreans would die!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tian Mingzi nodded. He launched his movement technique and readied himself to fly away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But… I hope that I can leave a tracking rune on your body. This is also for your own safety. How about it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Tian Mingzi was about to leave, Mister Zhou stopped him with some words. A tracking rune appeared on his fingertip. This was one of the Asura Road’s god runes and symbolized the Laws of the Asura Road. Once this rune marked his body then it was impossible for even someone of Tian Mingzi’s cultivation level to remove.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tian Mingzi frowned. He didn’t like to be followed, but after a moment’s hesitation he nodded his head in assent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mister Zhou flicked his fingers and the rune shot into Tian Mingzi’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Tian Mingzi didn’t delay any further. He turned and flew away!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Looking at Tian Mingzi’s vanishing back, Imperial Prince Naqi said, “If that fellow suddenly proposed to divide into two groups, he must have some other reason to do so.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Naqi was someone who believed everyone was plotting something, and Tian Mingzi was someone who was particularly good at scheming. If he suddenly wanted to split up the group, he was definitely trying something.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He might have discovered something. Perhaps he wishes to explore a lucky chance by himself, or perhaps he found Lin Ming and is in a hurry to kill him so he can plunder the secrets from his body for himself!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Mister Zhou spoke these words, Naqi wrinkled his eyebrows. “Yet you still let him leave. Even a tracking mark is useless; it will only take an instant to kill Lin Ming with the difference in their cultivation. At that time, all the secrets on Lin Ming’s body will be taken by him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mister Zhou said, “Imperial Prince Your Highness, you can’t have your cake and eat it too. Lin Ming has a great destiny on his body, and even if all of us join together and attack him now, killing him won’t be easy. Even Tian Mingzi only guarantees our chances to be higher. If Tian Mingzi can really kill Lin Ming then even if he takes all of Lin Ming’s secrets for himself we will also have gained.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I suppose.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Naqi would certainly be happy if he didn’t need to pay any price to kill Lin Ming. Of course, this was based on the fact that he simply didn’t know what secret Lin Ming had on him. If he knew about the existence of the Magic Cube, then perhaps even the Good Fortune Saint Sovereign would personally tear apart God Burying Ridge; he might even engage in all-out war with the soul race for that reason alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mister Zhou’s guess was correct. Whether it was in strength or sensing ability, Tian Mingzi surpassed Mister Zhou. Even Mister Zhou’s Heaven Spying Art was unable to compare with Tian Mingzi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A moment ago Tian Mingzi had already found Lin Ming’s location. A man and a woman travelling alone; that was undoubtedly Lin Ming and Xiao Moxian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason he proposed to divide the group into two was because he wanted to have sole possession of Lin Ming’s secrets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lin Ming… the end of your days has come. Everything that you have will be mine!” Tian Mingzi’s eyes shimmered with an ominous light. He had waited for this day for far too long!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He desperately wished to kill Lin Ming! As Tian Mingzi’s sense passed over Lin Ming and Xiao Moxian, it was even clearer than it was a moment ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming’s mind chilled and he stopped where he was. “There is no need to continue running. The enemy has arrived, and he is much faster than we are…”</span></p>
