 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This planet was a quarter billion miles in diameter, several times larger than the Sky Spill Planet.</span></p>

It was a part of a small world near the Crimson Light World and also had no masters, thus no one paid attention to East Blue Planet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">6500 years ago when the Divine Realm fell to its enemies, the many Holy Lands of the Crimson Light World were destroyed by the saints and a massive number of human masters perished in battle. As for the extremely distant East Blue Planet, it was also looted in the calamity. At that time, the number one sect of the East Blue Planet, the East Blue Sect, was targeted by a squad of saints.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This squad ordered the Blue East Sect to hand over all their spirit medicines, resources, and cultivation methods. Otherwise, they would completely annihilate the entire East Blue Planet and all their families.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The leader of this saint squad was only a Saint Lord realm powerhouse, but the East Blue Sect was a mere seventh grade sect and the sect’s strongest Highest Elder was also at the Divine Lord realm. The other Sovereigns and Elders were at the Divine Transformation realm, and when they heard these demands they were incensed and wished to fight them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But, they also knew that facing the invasion of the saints, they were nothing but a bunch of ants; simply unworthy of mentioning. They had no choice but to accept their fate.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This enraged the disciples of the East Blue Sect. They fought with the saint race squad and killed off many of their martial artists, but there were even more saint martial artists that managed to flee.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What came after that was the brutal retaliation of the saints. A peak Saint Lord powerhouse arrived and slew the Highest Ancestor of the East Blue Sect before killing all the masters within the sect. Some of the young girls within the sect dreaded the horrible fates they would have to suffer and committed suicide.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These actions touched upon the nerves of the saints. They began a massacre on the East Blue Planet, killing billions and billions of humans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that time, everyone ran away in panic. Some descendants of the East Blue Sect were lucky enough to escape the destruction.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If one were to trace the Ancient Phoenix Clan and Ancient Dragon Clan to their origins, it would be that some powerhouses had ventured into the God Beast Mystic Realm where they found the corpses of four God Beasts. Afterwards, the four God Beast Clans were established and they slowly developed into Holy Lord and World King level influences.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the calamity of the Divine Realm, an influence like the four God Beast Clans naturally weren’t able to escape the cleansing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ancient Phoenix Clan was in a much luckier position. Because of their relationship with Lin Ming, they were especially looked after during the evacuation. Some masters of their clan and some people who were related to Lin Ming went to the wild universe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But the Ancient Phoenix Clan had 72 palaces, and a massive number of their disciples were either killed in the great calamity or sent scattering in all directions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some of these exiled disciples gathered at the East Blue Planet where they formed a new joint organization with the survivors of the other great influences, called the Heaven and Earth Alliance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Heaven and Earth Alliance had gathered the inheritances of many sects; the cultivations methods were disorderly and confusingly diverse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the Divine Realm was captured by the saints, they simply didn’t allow humans to possess inheritances at the Holy Lord level or above. As soon as they discovered any hints of this, it would be completely eliminated! In addition to the previous looting, the inheritances of the Heaven and Earth Alliance now looked like a complete mess to any high level martial artist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, a strange scene occurred on the East Blue Planet. Formed on this planet was a large influence with over a billion disciples and extremely complex internal relationships – the Heaven and Earth Alliance. At the same time, the Heaven and Earth Alliance had no singular master. Its structure was loose and it possessed all sorts of inheritances…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even so, within East Blue Planet and even the small world that the East Blue Planet was located in, the Heaven and Earth Alliance was the martial arts holy land that all young human martial artists yearned to join.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Heaven and Earth Alliance recruited disciples every ten years, and the scene of these disciples being tested was extremely glorious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These young martial artists came from planets far and wide. They exhausted all of their strength and cunning to pass the inspection and enter the Heaven and Earth Alliance. This was because besides the Heaven and Earth Alliance, there was no other place they could find such a level of inheritances.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In this age, this was just how pitiful human martial artists had become.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if someone was gifted, even if someone was talented, if they couldn’t find a cultivation method jade slip, if they couldn’t find a master, if they didn’t have resources, than any talent they had was wasted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Lin Ming were to live during this time, even he wouldn’t be able to grow. When Lin Ming was in the lower realms he had managed to make do with the scarce resources there. But once he ascended to the Divine Realm, he entered the Ancient Phoenix Clan and was even cared for by Empyrean Divine Dream and Empyrean Vast Universe afterwards. All of this was outside help.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not to mention anything else, without Empyrean Divine Dream’s help, Lin Ming wouldn’t even have been able to enter the Asura Road and it would have been impossible for him to study the Asura Heavenly Dao.</span></p>

They would never have imagined that such a huge amount of inheritances would be at their hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, there were far too many scattered inheritances in Heavenly Sutra Pavilion. When disciples entered, they had a limited amount of time. Oftentimes they weren’t able to maximize their harvests.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a group of young disciples rushed into Heavenly Sutra Pavilion in high spirits, what greeted them was a middle-aged man in tattered robes, reclining in a chair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This middle-aged man seemed to be around 30-40 years of age. He had a long beard and a face that was weathered from the winds and cold. There was a pot of wine in his hands and he was sloppily dressed. But, what was strange was that his eyes didn’t seem listless and blurry as expected, but were bright and lively, just like the eyes of a youth.</span></p>
