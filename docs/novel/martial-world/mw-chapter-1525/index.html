It carried a terrifying demonic power that was incompatible with the Laws that Tian Mingzi knew of, as if it were its own independent Laws!</span></p>

Since he didn’t understand the Asura Heavenly Dao he certainly wasn’t able to control the strength contained within these iron-armored spectral soldiers. When he sucked in this strength that was infused with this strange devilish power, it was like eating a handful of poison powder.</span></p>

I must use guerilla tactics and avoid any frontal confrontation as much as I can to reduce my energy usage to the minimum.” Tian Mingzi didn’t fear contending with this incomplete group of iron-armored spectral soldiers. Rather, what he feared was Lin Ming, who was hiding away in Primordius Heavenly Palace!</span></p>

This stone bed was formed from chaos stones; it was where Empyrean Primordius usually cultivated.</span></p>

If any of these treasures were taken to the outside, they would become objects that World King Holy Lands would brutally wage war for.</span></p>

I have a feeling that once Tian Mingzi breaks through the iron-armored spectral soldiers, although he will have consumed a great deal of strength, he won’t be completely exhausted. If that happens, even if you and I are completely restored, the both of us combined will not be his match…”</span></p>

The moment that Tian Mingzi defeated the iron-armored spectral soldiers would also be his weakest moment. If Lin Ming couldn’t defeat Tian Mingzi at this time, then as more time passed, Tian Mingzi would only become increasingly strong.</span></p>

At this time, she had no idea what they could do. In this God Burying Ridge she had experienced all sorts of dangers and tribulations, and she had slowly become accustomed to relying on Lin Ming to come up with a plan for these times.</span></p>

He took out some blood vitality restoring pills from his spatial ring and swallowed them all down as he started to meditate.</span></p>

Currently, Lin Ming’s blood vitality was too weak and he couldn’t handle the more brutal medicines.</span></p>

With the two of them together, Lin Ming’s True Dragon energy blended with her True Phoenix blood. The energy between them echoed, becoming stronger, boundless.</span></p>

Their aura, blood vitality, energies, and even their life force mixed together, lifting each other up.</span></p>

After all, he had lost a tremendous amount of blood vitality and had to rely on Xiao Moxian’s primordial yin energy to make up for it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After being revitalized by Xiao Moxian’s blood vitality, the muscles over Lin Ming’s lower abdomen began to wriggle about. His organs regenerated and the skin began knitting together. His wound was regenerating at a visible speed.</span></p>

Xiao Moxian’s body was dripping with sweat. As Lin Ming’s vigorous yang energy entered her body she felt her entire body heat up. Blood rushed to her face, making her feel comfortable and warm, like her entire body was melting away into a puddle.</span></p>

She had diligently cultivated in Tragic Death Valley for nine years and had also studied the first volume of the Asura Sutra. She was extremely close to breaking into the Divine Lord boundary!</span></p>

His entire body was comfortable and his pores opened up. The 360 acupoints on his body as well as the tens of thousands of pores were wide open, greedily absorbing the primordial yin energy that Xiao Moxian was releasing. As this energy circulated through Lin Ming’s body, all sorts of changes occurred within him, accompanied by a myriad of different tastes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In a time of crisis, the two of them had completely invested themselves in this cultivation process. They became familiar with each other’s body. This sort of familiarity was not just their bodies, but even their bloodline, inner world, and spiritual sea was completely opened to the other party.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was unknown how long this state continued for. Lin Ming’s eyes remained shut tight and the wound on his abdomen had already completely healed. Even a good portion of his blood vitality had been restored. Although it wasn’t to his peak state, it was far, far better than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After being in this state of perfect harmony, Xiao Moxian’s large, pitch-black eyes opened. Her eyes blinked as she stared at Lin Ming right in front of her. She was only a mere three inches from his face, and at this distance she could clearly smell the unique and masculine scent wafting from his body. This scene smelled quite nice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming’s face was strong, with distinct edges. He had extraordinary looks. His eyes were like stars and his eyebrows slanted up like swords. His body was filled with the spirit and soul of a vibrant, outstanding young elite, but he still retained the calm atmosphere of a mature martial artist.</span></p>

His eyelids gently trembled and his body continued to release a strong yang energy. As this energy entered Xiao Moxian’s body, it made her feel so good that she thought she was drunk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She didn’t know how long she had been staring at Lin Ming for. Her cheeks were red, endlessly alluring. Sometimes her vision was clear, and sometimes her vision was blurry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this time, Lin Ming opened his eyes.</span></p>

She continued to stare at him as before, both of them in close proximity to each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her eyes flickered. Within her eyes was the naïve innocence of a girl, the tender feelings of a young woman, as well as ten thousand flavors of emotions that had yet to mature. Just the light in Xiao Moxian’s eyes had countless meanings that she couldn’t express.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Xiao Moxian’s eyes that were sometimes clear and sometimes blurry, Lin Ming was stunned for a moment. But at this time, he couldn’t think about it too much. His palm turned and a black bead appeared in his hand. This was the Grandmist Spirit Bead essence that he obtained from the Eternal Demon Abyss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the blood and flesh essence energy gathered by the Grandmist Spirit Bead over a period of a hundred million years. When Lin Ming was at the Eternal Demon Abyss he had used 10% of the energy within to break through his cultivation boundary. The remaining 90% had been left over because he was too weak to absorb it all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now that he had broken into the Divine Lord realm, taking out the Grandmist Spirit Bead essence to restore his blood vitality was just the right timing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Grandmist Spirit Bead essence was an extremely potent and tyrannical medicine. Lin Ming had mixed together with Xiao Moxian in perfect harmony to restore a part of his blood vitality, and only then did he dare to think about absorbing it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This Grandmist Spirit Bead that was covered with demonic runes slowly floated upwards, levitating between Lin Ming and Xiao Moxian. Xiao Moxian was stirred out of her thoughts. Then, her eyes shifted from Lin Ming’s face to this mysterious black bead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lin Ming… this is…”</span></p>
