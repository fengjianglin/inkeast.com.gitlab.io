An incomparably large pitch black crack tore through the world, as if a colossal pair of hands had reached up into the skies and ripped apart the heavens. Behind this terrifying crack was a strange and incredible world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just by looking at this world, one felt their mind, divine soul, and even blood energy be attracted towards it, as if their very being wanted to tear out of their body.</span></p>

Within these phantoms there were God Beasts and peerless powerhouses alike. Their powerful auras wove together with the lines of the Heavenly Dao Laws, making even those people watching from several hundred miles away feel like their souls were shaking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the final trial!</span></p>

This sort of suppressive feeling came from the momentum of the world, making them feel as if they were facing the entire universe!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Out of the hundreds of thousands of people watching from around the Asura Sea, most of them were only observers. None of them dared to truly break into the entrance of the final trial.</span></p>

Several men and women flew through the skies. These men and women wore feathered robes and their heads were adorned by a crown of star-like gems. Their bearing was magnificent and with a single glance one could see they were elite disciples of a great sect!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Those are people from Divine Void Divine Kingdom!”</span></p>

To think we would run into him here also, it’s even worse than being haunted by ghosts!”</span></p>

To think that this Duke Fullmoon who had pestered Lin Ming at the Divine Rune City Auction, constantly hounding him like some rabid dog, would actually enter the final trial. As she thought of encountering this person, Xiao Moxian felt as if she had stepped in dog shit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then again, isn’t this fellow not so young anymore? How did he obtain the qualifications to enter Divine Void Divine Kingdom’s group for the final trial?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Moxian asked, puzzled. According to her estimations, World King Fullmoon was at least several thousand years old. Without accumulating strength for so much time, it was impossible for him to become a World King. And one didn’t need to be a genius to know that there was extremely intense competition within Divine Void Divine Kingdom for spots in the final trial. There were countless disciples eagerly wanting to enter!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming said, “Several thousand years isn’t too old. To an Empyrean that lives for a hundred million years, this is still a baby. And in this final trial, normally those that are several hundred years old or thousands of years old will participate for their sect. For instance, the Good Fortune Saint Son seemed to have entered the final trial around the time he was at the Saint Lord realm…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although those that participated in the final trial were young, they normally weren’t as young as Xiao Moxian and Lin Ming. Even with the time in Tragic Death Valley included, Lin Ming was only around 120 years old.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The people flying through the air immediately became the focus of the crowd. Within the group of trial challengers, there was a young man wearing a dragon crown, his long hair trailing behind him as he trod on the wind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s finally opened! I’ve awaited this day for far too long!”</span></p>

Behind him, the several heroic elites of Divine Void Divine Kingdom, including Duke Fullmoon, were treating him with respect, faintly taking him as their lead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this young man’s cultivation was the lowest amongst everyone from the Divine Void Divine Kingdom; he was only at the half-step Holy Lord realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A half-step Holy Lord youth was actually able to command so many Holy Lords and World Kings behind him.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He is the Divine Void Third Crown Prince.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Brightmoon began to explain. A ‘Crown Prince’ of Divine Void Divine Kingdom was nothing but a title; they in no way referred to the true son of the Soul Emperor Divine Void. Currently, Divine Void Divine Kingdom had seven Crown Princes, each one belonging to one of the seven great divine provinces that comprised it. Every Crown Prince was an elite amongst elites, and they were the future rulers of their lands. Even the next Soul Emperor would be selected from amongst the Crown Princes. As for the Third Crown Prince, he was considered to be one of the strongest of the seven Divine Void Crown Princes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So that’s how it is.” Lin Ming said, suddenly realizing the situation. No wonder this Third Crown Prince was able to command so many people with the lowest cultivation. In a situation where he was able to survive, then it was best to enter the final trial at the youngest age possible in order to obtain greater advantages.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for someone like Duke Fullmoon who only entered the final trial at the World King realm, the truth was that his talent was considered relatively poor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Look behind that Divine Void Crown Prince at the woman following him; that is the Crown Prince’s Imperial Concubine…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this time, standing behind Mo Brightmoon, Fanny Fafa suddenly spoke up. His voice was soft and gentle. If one didn’t see him and only listened to his voice, they might even think him a woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Imperial Concubine’s cultivation is even higher than the Divine Void Crown Prince’s...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Fanny Fafa said, there was truly a young woman following behind the Third Crown Prince, her appearance as beautiful as a flower. She exuded sex appeal from every inch of her body and her charming looks were cute and flirtatious. At first glance, one could see she was a truly outstanding existence. And, her cultivation was at the peak Holy Lord realm, a full large boundary higher than the Divine Void Crown Prince.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s not anything strange.” Fanny Fafa chuckled as he spoke. He said in a strange and meaning-filled hushed voice, “You might not know, but that Imperial Concubine was especially raised to be given to the Divine Void Crown Prince so that he could dual cultivate with her. When the Divine Void Crown Prince deflowered the Imperial Concubine, he must have obtained a great advantage! The Imperial Concubine also has a pure yin physique, but her physique might not be as...pure...as mine… hehehe…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Listening to Fanny Fafa, Lin Ming nearly choked on himself. He rubbed his nose and subconsciously took a step back. He couldn’t help but sigh with emotion. The Divine Void Crown Prince’s treatment was far too good. Not to mention the resources he had growing up or the final trial spot he was given, there was even a dual cultivation companion specifically raised for him by his sect.</span></p>

This team was led by a fat young man who wore a bright yellow robe embroidered with a five-clawed dragon, just like the robes of a mortal emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s people from Heaven Union Divine Kingdom!”</span></p>

Heaven Union Divine Kingdom was the only colossal influence in the inner Asura Road that could directly contend with Divine Void Divine Kingdom!</span></p>

His status is no worse than that of the Divine Void Third Crown Prince…”</span></p>

Moreover, Divine Void Divine Kingdom and Heaven Union Divine Kingdom were in sharp opposition to each other from the start. As the Divine Void Third Crown Prince and Bigflame met each other, their vision seemed to turn into tangible essence that violently collided in the skies!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These two people were both peerless proud sons of heaven from True Divinity influences. With both of them being such proud characters, once they met they naturally had to compete to see who was lower and who was higher!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Divine Void Third Crown Prince sneered and unhurriedly said, “Did you come here especially to provoke me today? How interesting! My Divine Void Divine Kingdom has long been fighting your Heaven Union Divine Kingdom. During every final trial, the fights between juniors make for the fiercest battlefield. There is even a tradition of gambling fights. How about it? Do you want to make a bet with me today?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha! Aren’t you just overconfident in yourself? My goal this time is to obtain at least 80%. If you want to make a bet with me then you had best consider your own worth first!”</span></p>

The Divine Void Third Crown Prince only laughed in response. 80%? It was like this person thought he would achieve that just by saying it.</span></p>

This was a pill on the transcendent divine level, but in a True Divinity Holy Land, many transcendent divine pills came from the hands of a True Divinity so the effects were normally much better than those of an ordinary transcendent divine pill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only the extreme genius of a True Divinity influence would be able to take out a top pill like this for a bet.</span></p>

With this, one could see just how intense the competition in the final trial would be. In addition to the horrifying pressure that exuded from that soul-freezing entrance as well as the droves of elites that came from all the large influences around the Asura Road, even if many of the martial artists present weren’t able to participate in the final trial, just being able to be here to witness such a grand event left them all inexplicably excited!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Good! If you want to give me pills then I won’t stop you!” Bigflame laughed. He led the group from Heaven Union Divine Kingdom towards the incomparably massive black crack that was the final trial, and then they all disappeared without leaving a trace.</span></p>

If they were sucked in by such a terrifying black vortex wouldn’t they just lose their lives?</span></p>

In the wild and fierce storm of energy, she seemed as if she were taking a casual stroll through the woods. Her step wasn’t quick, but in just several moments she arrived before the massive vortex of the final trial. Then, like a blue flower petal, she was sucked into the vortex, immediately vanishing from sight.</span></p>

Just a moment ago, when the high-spirited Bigflame and Third Crown Prince were arguing, Lin Ming hadn’t felt much at all. But in this brief moment when that blue-clothed woman fluttered about like a spirit in the wind, this actually left a deep impression on Lin Ming’s mind.</span></p>

To them, it was merely a little spirited tussle between juniors.</span></p>

This other person was wrapped in a red cloak and his body exuded a terrifying fluctuation of Laws. “Luckily for us she is someone from the 33 Heavens so she will not return to the Asura Road so easily, otherwise, the balance between the saints and spiritas within the inner Asura Road would be broken by her…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mm. The Asura Road is separated from the 33 Heavens by a barrier of Laws that was laid down by the Asura Road Master. No matter how powerful the spiritas of the 33 Heavens are, it won’t affect us. I just have no idea what completion percent this horrifying woman will have and what rewards she will obtain. Really, she is truly a cause for envy…”</span></p>
