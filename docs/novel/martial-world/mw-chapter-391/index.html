 <p><strong>Chapter 391 New Thunder Soul.</strong></p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
 <p><span style>Chapter 391 – New Thunder Soul</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Mu Qianyu saw what Lin Ming had done, she was scared into a cold sweat. Lin Ming had actually directly pressed the Blood Extinguishing Demon Thunder towards his heart! But, the Blood Extinguishing Demon Thunder was an evil existence that could swallow blood essence. Directly putting such a thing into your heart was just too risky!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lin Ming, you…”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chi chi!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The clothes on Lin Ming’s chest were burned to ash. In that instant, his skin there had also lost color. This was the direct result of the Blood Extinguishing Demon Thunder absorbing one’s blood essence!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Qianyu’s mind jumped. But as she thought of the repeated miracles that Lin Ming had accomplished in the past half year, she didn’t say anything. Instead, she fished around in her ring for some pills that could help replenish blood. She found a Nine Revolution Blood Vitality pill, and gave it to Lin Ming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Blood Extinguishing Demon Thunder could swallow one’s blood essence. Having a pill that could restore the power of blood vitality a bit would greatly assist in alleviating the pressure on Lin Ming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming swallowed the Nine Revolution Blood Vitality Pill and waved his head, saying, “I’m alright.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Initially, when his cultivation was only at the peak Bone Forging stage, he had been able to absorb the Purple Flood Dragon Divine Thunder. Now that his cultivation had increased by a great deal, it naturally wouldn’t be dangerous to absorb the Blood Extinguishing Demon Thunder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In fact, as the Blood Extinguishing Demon Thunder entered his heart, it was already completely suppressed by the Heretical God Seed. Due to their toughness and strength, Lin Ming’s meridians were already able to withstand nearly any impact it could offer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for the blood that the Blood Extinguishing Demon Thunder was swallowing, or even the blood essence, Lin Ming simply didn’t care. This was a necessary process in absorbing the Blood Extinguishing Demon Thunder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One had to use their own blood vitality and blood essence to feed the Blood Extinguishing Demon Thunder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If the power of one’s blood vitality wasn’t enough, then the Blood Extinguishing Demon Thunder would suck dry all of that person’s blood, and that person would die. Afterwards, the Thunder Soul would just escape.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, if one’s power of blood vitality was robust enough and their meridians were also tough enough, they would be able to suppress and control the Blood Extinguishing Demon Thunder. As for their blood essence that it had absorbed, it would all become their own again. As long as the Blood Extinguishing Demon Thunder didn’t escape, there would be no loss.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But the feeling of having the Blood Extinguishing Demon Thunder absorbing his blood essence was also a very unpleasant sensation. Lin Ming felt half his body go cold, and his hands and feet became dull. His sense of touch was becoming less sensitive, and he felt like the other half of his body didn’t even belong to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The power of thunder within the Blood Extinguishing Demon Thunder had a very powerful corrosive effect. When it circulated in one’s meridians, it was no different than a strong acid – it was an incomparably burning and painful feeling. Along with the mass consumption of blood essence, one would feel like they were dying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Qianyu could clearly see thin black strings running out from Lin Ming’s heart like words, spreading everywhere throughout his body. They spread to his arms, his legs, and even his neck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the breath of death; it was caused by the loss of a massive amount of blood essence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Qianyu had a certain understanding of the Blood Extinguishing Demon Thunder. Although there were many martial artists that were able to finally absorb it, their body would suffer a major deficit in their blood and undergo necrosis in certain parts because of a lack of blood. Afterwards, they would have to spend a long period of time recuperating in bed. She didn’t hope that this was what would happen to Lin Ming. If the Divine Phoenix Mystic Realm officially opened and Lin Ming wasn’t able to attend, he would need to wait another three years. Once he was almost 20 years old, he would have missed the best time to participate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Mu Qianyu thought this, she also took out a Blood Yang Pill from her spatial ring. This Blood Yang Pill was refined from 1000 year old Blood Yang Lingzhi and was a priceless treasure. It was also one of the pills that Mu Qianyu saved as life insurance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lin Ming…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m alright. I’m just letting it absorb whatever blood essence it wants. I have an idea of what I’m doing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming pushed away the Blood Yang Pill. His power of blood vitality was extremely formidable. In addition, he also had the endless azure true essence. With these things, he would be able to restrain the breath of death that spread in his body. There was no need for Mu Qianyu to waste such an important pill that was used to insure her life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason that he was allowing the Blood Extinguishing Demon Thunder to crazily swallow whatever blood essence it wanted to in his heart was to fuse with it on a deeper level and have better control over it. Finally, he would completely integrate it into the Heretical God Seed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But he didn’t expect that the savage and greedy nature of the Blood Extinguishing Demon Thunder had even surpassed his imagination.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time, the Blood Extinguishing Demon Thunder in Lin Ming’s body was like a massive leech that was plump with blood. With the great attractive force of the Heretical God Seed acting on his entire body, no matter how hard or frantically the Blood Extinguishing Demon Thunder struggled, it still wouldn’t be able to escape from this vortex of suction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Blood Extinguishing Demon Thunder suddenly uttered a hoarse scream. At one end, an open mouth formed. This mouth was only the size of a bean, but it had long rows of dense and sharp fangs. As Lin Ming looked within his body, his heart suddenly went cold; it was too spooky and unnatural for a Thunder Soul to suddenly develop a mouth with fangs in it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah! Ah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Blood Extinguishing Demon Thunder screamed over and over, and suddenly bit into the walls of Lin Ming’s heart!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puff!</span></i><span style> Flesh and blood splattered out!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming’s body shook, his face went pale. No matter how extremely formidable his blood vitality was, it was very difficult to withstand the pain of his heart being injured!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming grit his teeth, and then conjured up a net of azure true essence that fell over the Blood Extinguishing Demon Thunder, forming a cocoon that wrapped around it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see… you’re the one that’s making trouble!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming became aware of a will that was placed within the Blood Extinguishing Demon Thunder, and his mouth curved up in a smile. With a thought, a crazy surge of true essence emerged around the Blood Extinguishing Demon Thunder. In that moment, there was only a tearing ‘</span><i><span style>chi</span></i><span style>’ sound as if a flame was going out. A wisp of a residual soul turned into smoke as it was destroyed from within the Blood Extinguishing Demon Thunder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lei Mubai, who had been lying down on the stone floor next door, fiercely trembled. He spat out a mouthful of blood, and this blood even contained a faint hint of blood essence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His complexion was now no different than golden funeral paper. His lips trembled; he knew that the wisp of residual will that he had hid within the Blood Extinguishing Demon Thunder had been exterminated by Lin Ming!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He humorlessly smiled, his entire mouth wet with blood. He had placed that wisp of remnant will within the Blood Extinguishing Demon Thunder a long time ago, before his cultivation had been wasted. He thought that even if he couldn’t prevent Lin Ming from absorbing the Blood Extinguishing Demon Thunder, he should still at least be able to damage the blood vitality of his enemy. But he didn’t that that his residual will would be so easily destroyed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lei Mubai was filled with a sense of despair. His eyes looked up at the ceiling, and now there was no longer any light left within them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>………………..</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Lei Mubai’s residual will was destroyed, the Blood Extinguishing Demon Thunder seemed to have lost its strength and vigor. It no longer had the ability to resist the massive attractive force, and it was sucked flying into the vortex of the Heretical God Seed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahhh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Blood Extinguishing Demon Thunder gave out a final miserable shriek before it was received into the coiling dragon steel needle. The two inch long coiling dragon steel needle suddenly grew to three inches, and on the surface of it appeared a small red snake. This small red snake coiled around steel needle a total of eight times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It connected together with Purple Flood Dragon Divine Thunder.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>In that instant, a new coiling dragon steel needle was born, and an unbridled power of thunder erupted forth, flooding through all of Lin Ming’s meridians. This power of thunder was so brutal that Lin Ming only felt his entire body shake and his skeleton pop all over. The impure pill toxins within his meridians were all burned by a blazing hot power of thunder, instantly turning into ash!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming stuffily coughed, then vomited a mouthful of black blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Qianyu was shocked. She quickly held onto Lin Ming and propped him up, disregarding the taboos that existed between men and women. She extended her perception into Lin Ming’s body, and suddenly she was shocked, and then immediately overjoyed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming’s meridians had linked up once more and the tenacity of his meridians had increased by another great margin. He had finally stepped into the peak Pulse Condensation period!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lin Ming, you broke through!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm, it was a breakthrough.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming let out a long breath. He had already been stranded in the late Pulse Condensation period for far too long. During the three months he had spent at Dark Moon Island, he had built up too many pill toxins within his body. He had been constantly refining and eliminating them, but it was still very difficult to cleanly remove them all. He hadn’t thought that this time, with such a savage power of thunder coursing through him, it would completely remove all of the impurities in his body. The black blood that Lin Ming had spat out was all of the pill toxins and impurities in his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming’s cultivation had already approached the peak Pulse Condensation period. At the banquet competition, his cultivation had consolidated once again, and in addition to breaking through to the second layer of the ‘Vermillion Bird Forbidden Divine Chronicle’ as well as clearing up all of the pill toxins in his body, he had successfully reached the peak Pulse Condensation period.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I wonder if my strength can exceed an early Xiantian master now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Lin Ming opened the Heretical God Force, he was able to attain the strength to suppress a common early Xiantian master. But, the Heretical God Force could not last in perpetuity. When a battle dragged out for a long time, he would most likely lose. At best, he would fight to a draw.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now that he had broken through to the peak Pulse Condensation period, Lin Ming’s strength had surged upwards again. He wanted to find an early Xiantian master and test out his newfound strength; being comparable to an early Xiantian master and defeating one were two entirely different concepts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He immersed his sense in the newly evolved Thunder Soul. Suddenly, Lin Ming was surprised, “Mm? There’s this change?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the new coiling dragon steel needle, he felt two energies. He felt the manic and violent Purple Flood Dragon Divine Thunder that was like an unstoppable force, but he also felt the evil and cruel Blood Extinguishing Demon Thunder that thirsted for life!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It actually completely retained both Thunder Souls’ characteristics?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not only that, but it was also improved to a medium-grade earth-step Thunder Soul!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although it was currently the weakest and most basic of the medium-grade earth-step Thunder Souls, Lin Ming was satisfied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Mu Qianyu saw Lin Ming’s excited appearance, she finally relaxed. It seemed that Lin Ming had managed to keep everything under control. At this time, even the black lines along Lin Ming’s body were beginning to fade away, and they soon disappeared. His original healthy looking skin was also restored to its vibrant color.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Qianyu’s beautiful eyes turned. She suddenly had an idea that she wanted to take a close look at Lin Ming’s Thunder Soul. But the truth was that this sort of request was very rude and impolite for martial artists. Even between friends, one wouldn’t rashly ask to see the other’s final resort. Not only that, but this Thunder Soul also involved the secrets within Lin Ming’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, once a girl’s curiosity was aroused, it was very difficult to restrain. Mu Qianyu really wanted to know why Lin Ming was able to contain two Thunder Souls in his body. She blinked, and then softly said, “Lin Ming, may I have a look at your Thunder Soul?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Such a soft and sweet tone was very comfortable to hear. Lin Ming also didn’t have much hesitation towards Mu Qianyu. He directly took out the Divine Demon Thunder Soul.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chi!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The three inch long Thunder Soul steel needle immediately leapt out from Lin Ming’s fingertips and paused atop his palm, circling there as it floated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the steel needle, there was a Purple Flood Dragon that coiled around the body, but there was also a red serpent. One dragon, one snake – both were very vivid and lifelike. Every scale was outlined, and even their clear eyes could be seen. It was just like a real dragon and snake had been trapped within the steel needle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the Thunder Soul appeared, reddish-purple arcs of electricity scattered out in all directions, and the thunder origin energy of the entire stone chamber suddenly became frenzied as if it were constantly being sucked into the Divine Demon Thunder Soul, forming a purplish red vortex.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Qianyu’s bright eyes widened, shock coloring her expression. “This… this is the Thunder Soul?”</span></p>
