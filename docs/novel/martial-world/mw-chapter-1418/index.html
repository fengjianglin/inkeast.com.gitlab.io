 <p><span style>Chapter 1418 – Suppressing the Imperial Prince</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>In that moment, every ounce of origin energy between the heavens and earth began to crazily gather towards that seed of chaos, forming a dark star black hole!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Lin Ming used the entirety of his strength to thrust this dark star black hole towards Imperial Prince Naqi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dragon Wrestling Art, I’ll blow you up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Naqi lifted his hands high, bringing the heaven-sundering war halberd into the air. Then, he smashed down. This strike was used with 120% of his strength. He revolved all of his astral essence to the limit. His muscles bulged outwards as countless blue veins rose up, squirming about like earthworms even as they burst apart beneath the pressure!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The heaven-sundering war halberd came pounding down!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>With a dreadful explosion, Naqi’s halberd collided with the black hole seed!</span></p>
 <p><span style>In that instant, all the space within 10 miles collapsed!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the space of the Divine Void! Underneath the intense collision of Lin Ming and Naqi’s strike, this stable space was as frail as glass!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A battle between a Divine Transformation and Saint Transformation martial artist can actually cause the space within 10 miles to collapse!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“These two people are the absolute king amongst kings within their level, no one can compete with them! In front of them, a divine mountain is as frail as a sculpture and space is as thin as paper!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone cried out in alarm. At this time, the terrifying detonation force created by the black hole began to wantonly spread out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was Lin Ming and Naqi that bore the brunt of this terrifying impact.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Naqi’s entire body shook like an earthquake passed through it. The skin and flesh of his arms cracked apart and his palms split open. The bones of his arms cracked to pieces and he almost lost all feeling in his arms!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Naqi never imagined that this ordinary-looking black hole would be unbelievably hard. Not only did it withstand his attack but it also erupted with a terrifying strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the one controlling this black hole, the impact that Lin Ming had to withstand was not light. Even though the black hole couldn’t be destroyed, Lin Ming still received tremendous wounds underneath the reckless surges of energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The explosive energy swept over Lin Ming like a wave, forcing him back a thousand feet. Only then was he able to stabilize the restless blood within him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Naqi’s hands shivered. Blood dripped down his arms, gruesome and alarming. He nearly dropped the heaven-sundering war halberd.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He hadn’t thought that his battle with Lin Ming would reach such a frigid and savage degree.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Naqi had already consumed 60-70% of his astral essence. His strength had also plummeted by a great deal. But, he knew that he couldn’t weaken his momentum right now. Lin Ming definitely wasn’t in a better situation than he was. The victor of this fight would depend on who could hold out the longest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Naqi roared. He ignored his severely wounded arms and rushed towards Lin Ming once more!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After exhausting so much of his energy, he still didn’t stop for even the slightest moment. He instead hurtled himself into another collision.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter how ruthless you are, I can be even more ruthless!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This form of combat caused all the martial artists to suck in a breath of cold air!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ka ka ka ka!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Fierce and vicious bone spikes shot up from all over Naqi’s body!</span></p>
 <p><span style>As these bone spikes drilled forth from his skin, they brought behind them icky goo and blood. Each spike was four to five feet long, cold and dense just like a spear!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was not body metamorphosis, but one of Naqi’s attack methods. It was similar to the time that Blacksalt utilized the spikes on his back. This was an ability that came from certain bloodlines of the saint race.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time, Naqi’s arms were injured and he couldn’t control his halberd. Thus, he used his body as a weapon to forcefully hurtle himself towards Lin Ming!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wild Dragon Dash!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Naqi’s speed reached the extreme. Astral essence burned over his body. He was a massive black fireball that shot towards Lin Ming!</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time, because of the previous collision and him barely suppressing the tumbling blood within him, Lin Ming’s true essence was in a chaotic mess. Even so, he wanted to face Naqi’s crazy rush head on!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The grandmist space couldn’t be used to defend; Lin Ming had trouble summoning it right now. As for his blue soul battle spirit, just that alone was not enough. Even If he tried to use his Phoenix Blood Spear in conjunction with it, that was simply suicide!</span></p>
 <p><span style>For Naqi, this 1000 foot distance took less than an instant to cross!</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the human martial artists saw this, all of them cried out in alarm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Lin Ming actually remained remarkably calm. If Naqi hurtled towards him, although the might was great it would still put him at risk!</span></p>
 <p><span style>In this critical moment, Lin Ming’s pupils shrank. His soul force rushed into his inner world, and in front of Lin Ming, a massive stone gate appeared!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This stone gate emitted an infinite ancient aura. The entire gate was covered with mysterious carvings, as if a separate universe were sealed within it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the Primordius Gate!</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past, when Empyrean Primordius created this stone gate, he had done so with the highest level of chaos stone and then recorded all of the comprehensions he had gleaned in his lifetime. This included the complete heart mantra to the Primordius martial intent. However, the use of the Primordius Gate was not as simple as recording inheritances – it could also be used as a bafflingly powerful magic weapon!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming summoned all the true essence available to him and poured it into the Primordius Gate!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Naqi didn’t have time to react at all. He was like a raging bull, solidly smashing into the Primordius Gate!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The several spikes on Naqi’s body disintegrated into dust!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puff!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Naqi spat out a mouthful of blood as he was sent rolling hundreds of feet away. The dark red Primordius Gate, besides violently shaking a bit as Naqi crashed into it, wasn’t even damaged in the slightest!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The martial artists watching were all shocked. This battle was already at its crescendo. When both Lin Ming and Naqi were nearly spent dry, this strange scene had occurred.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This strike was absolutely adding wounds upon wounds for Naqi!</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the one controlling the Primordius Gate, Lin Ming only had to withstand the traction of energy as Naqi crashed into the gate. His blood restlessly stirred up within him, but the force he withstood was hundreds and thousands of times lighter than Naqi!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You… you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Naqi’s entire body shivered. His body was a mess of blood and flesh, and his muscles were split apart all over his body. Over half the bone armor that covered his body had broken and all of the spikes that jutted out from him had cracked apart. There were even some spikes that had pierced through his own flesh because of that massive impact just now, thrusting into his flesh. His meridians were broken and his organs were severely injured.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he spoke, he vomited a mouthful of blood. This blood was mixed with fragments of his organs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The current Naqi couldn’t even be described with just tragic!</span></p>
 <p><span style>If a human had been wounded to this degree, they would have died countless times already.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In that brief exchange just now, Lin Ming had taken a great advantage. But, this was due only to his magic weapon. The power of a weapon was a part of a martial artist’s strength, and Lin Ming currently was only able to stimulate a tiny portion of the Primordius Gate’s true strength; he was far from being able to fully control a treasure of this level. It was only that he had made the correct tactical choice at this moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Primordius Gate had resolved Naqi’s attack while simultaneously causing heavy losses to him!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Naqi was already at the point of collapse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time, Lin Ming opened the Eight Inner Hidden Gates once more. By relying on the Gate of Life he even burnt a part of his blood essence for greater strength. Now that he had the advantage, with Naqi having sustained severe wounds, he absolutely wouldn’t give his opponent any time to catch his breath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He picked up the Primordius Gate with both hands, and by relying on his formidable bodily strength, he brought this stone gate pounding down at Naqi!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was an attack using the Primordius Gate as a weapon!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Let alone the human martial artists that were skilled in the essence gathering system and were proficient in using the Laws, or even the saint martial artists that excelled in their bodily physiques, none of them had ever seen someone attack by picking up a massive stone gate and smashing it down on someone else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Primordius Gate could shrink and grow. In Lin Ming’s hands, it was 30-40 feet long, 20 feet wide, and a foot thick. As it came smashing down, the momentum and pressure it brought with it could roll over everything!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial Prince Naqi was panic-stricken. Without a care for the agonizing pain in his arms, he brought up the heaven-sundering war halberd to meet this strike!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Facing this massive gate that was as thick as a city wall, the originally large heaven-sundering war halberd seemed like nothing but a child’s toy.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>With a muffled ring, Imperial Prince Naqi was smashed away by Lin Ming’s Primordius Gate!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although he had barely managed to use the heaven-sundering war halberd to block this attack, his arms were in complete ruins. How could he withstand Lin Ming’s aggressive onslaught of gate smashes?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming stepped forwards. The Primordius Gate that he held in his hands came crashing down once more!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Like a fly, Naqi was sent tumbling back by Lin Ming again. He vomited blood in the air and even his war halberd was sent shooting away!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming revolved the Space Laws and chased after him!</span></p>
 <p><span style>One step one smash, Naqi vomited blood again and again. No matter how powerful the bodies of the saints were, and even if Naqi had completed two body metamorphoses and he also possessed a heaven-defying king bloodline, he still couldn’t withstand this brutal and savage barrage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was complete devastation! Overwhelming and brutal! A beating to the death!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This… this is…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Imperial Prince… is defeated!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The saint martial artists were bewildered. The number one person amongst the younger generation of saints, the one who possessed the king bloodline, the invincible legend that was Imperial Prince Naqi, was actually savagely beaten by a human!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The final victory of humans had not come due to the essence gathering system or use of the Laws, but had relied on Lin Ming’s powerful bodily strength. A stone gate had been used to pulverize Naqi, causing him to vomit out endless amounts of blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The saint race martial artists found this impossible to accept!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming roared and struck out once more. With a loud ringing sound, Naqi was brutally struck down and pounded deep into the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The earth caved in. Dust and sand rose up from all over. As the tens of thousands of saint and human martial artists saw this scene on the battlefield, all of them were left in utter silence.</span></p>
