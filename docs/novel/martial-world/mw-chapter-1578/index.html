The young maid propped herself up against the carved wooden door. She gathered her wits, her hand held against her chest even as her complexion was left paled and stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had been shocked by that shout because she was far too young and her cultivation was far too weak. As for that eunuch’s voice, it was extremely vigorous. Although there wasn’t any true essence in his voice it was still filled with energy, making the eardrums shake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And, another reason was that to a palace maid without any decent cultivation, the title of Empress was far too terrifying!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Empress was the mother of the nation and the head of the harem. All palace maids, all eunuchs, all imperial concubines, everyone had to obey the summons of the Empress. Within the harem, the Empress had absolute power!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now, a powerful chief eunuch had suddenly shouted out the decree of the Empress. This inevitably placed a great deal of pressure on a young maid!</span></p>

Now that the Marvel Blue Emperor was in closed door seclusion, if the Empress had issued a decree towards Imperial Concubine Moon then it was impossible that they would be chatting about old times. There was definitely some play involved concerning political and material benefits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And according to what Lin Ming knew, Prince Marvel Shen was the son of the Empress!</span></p>

Although his talent was a great deal worse than Grandprince Marvel Snow’s, the influence and power he grasped in his hands was several times greater than Marvel Snow’s!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And Blood Moon was also known as Imperial Concubine Moon. She was the offering that Grandprince Marvel Snow had given to the Marvel Blue Emperor.</span></p>

Of course, the basis of this was that Blood Moon was able to help Marvel Snow succeed the throne. Otherwise, if she failed, not only would she obtain no advantages but she might be dragged in without any ability to defend herself!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of these thoughts raced through Lin Ming’s mind. He could feel that the Empress’ summons this time had no good intentions behind them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Empress would certainly support her son Marvel Shen, and as for Blood Moon, she supported Marvel Snow. Between Empress and imperial concubine, there was bound to be a fierce battle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And at this time, Blood Moon had already exited to receive the decree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a written decree with the seal of the Empress as well as the mark of the imperial jade seal; it wasn’t a verbal decree only.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Generally speaking, if the Empress wanted to summon someone she would only need to pass on a message. She normally wouldn’t need to do something as serious as sending out a written decree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Imperial Concubine Moon. In these past days, the Empress has been managing national affairs and now she wishes to clear out the harem. In these last months the Emperor has been unable to pay attention to the affairs of the state and in his absence, there have been many princes and imperial concubines that have been forming their own influences within the imperial palace, even gathering guests here and creating all sorts of trouble and commotion. Now, the Empress has decreed a cleansing. Imperial Concubine Moon, I hope that you do not mind if I search through Full Moon Hall!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In front of Imperial Concubine Moon, a yellow-robed eunuch cunningly smiled. His voice was sharp and daggers were hidden in his smile. Although his face was old and covered with wrinkles his eyes were still as sharp as an eagle’s, as if he could see through people to their bones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a peak Holy Lord eunuch. Those eunuchs that wore yellow robes were all leaders amongst the eunuchs. For the Empress to send a chief eunuch to pass on a decree, it could be said that she was taking this matter extremely seriously. Moreover, there was even another team of eunuch bodyguards behind him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These eunuch bodyguards all had a Divine Lord realm cultivation. The leader amongst these eunuchs even had an early Holy Lord realm cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though Marvel Blue Nation was a peak Holy Land influence, it was still impossible for them to have Divine Lords everywhere. A true palace bodyguard normally had a late Divine Transformation realm cultivation. Now that a team of Divine Lords had been sent here, it was clear that they had sent their most outstanding individuals!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This uproar and threatening momentum was definitely not a good sign.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blood Moon frowned. According to palace rules, the Empress was in charge of the harem and she truly did have the authority to issue such a decree. Moreover, the Empress was now temporarily managing national affairs so her authority was even greater.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If she were to disobey then that would be violating the decree. There would be charges pushed against her, giving the Empress a chance to punish her!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blood Moon was in an extremely bad situation to begin with. If she stirred up more trouble then it would only be adding fuel to the fire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She quickly said with a true essence sound transmission, “Lin Ming, you and your companion must quickly leave through the transmission array here. I will have Eunuch Liang meet you on the outside! Although I have a token that allows you to enter the palace, the Empress is currently managing affairs of the state, thus if you were to fall into her hands she would be able to call down charges on you. If that were to happen then you would be dragged into this mess!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blood Moon’s words were quick and succinct; everything was heard by Lin Ming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These words left Lin Ming startled. He suddenly developed a much more favorable impression of Blood Moon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In Blood Moon’s opinion, Lin Ming must have some amazing master standing behind him. In ordinary times, it would be impossible for her to request a favor from Lin Ming’s master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But if Lin Ming were to fall into danger, that would be a completely different situation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If the Empress rashly did something to Lin Ming, harming him or even killing him, then it would be possible that Lin Ming’s master would take revenge for him. The anger of an Empyrean was no trifling matter. It was possible that the entire Marvel Blue Nation would be destroyed for this reason alone!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But Blood Moon did not use this to her advantage. Instead, she bid Lin Ming escape as soon as he could. The Imperial Palace had numerous masters standing guard here. If a junior like Lin Ming was wrapped up in the palace disputes then there really was a chance he would die!</span></p>
