Although Lin Ming didn’t look like an elite of any kind and he clearly came to take a look for the fun – weren’t they the same? There wasn’t a point to people who all never reached the finishing line laughing at each other.</span></p>

A light mountain breeze wafted up from the abyss, mixed with a refreshing light mist.</span></p>

They were cut into the cliff and marked with strange runes. From afar, it seemed as if they were rooted into the depths of the earth, like tall and slender totem poles that were thrust into the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming soon saw the soul sea marks atop the shrine platforms. They were pieces of clouds carved atop the cliff; beautiful and exquisite.</span></p>

He swept out his divine sense and searched for someone whose aura was a little chaotic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These types of people mostly didn’t possess much patience. Hopefully they would leave soon.</span></p>

It was unknown what race she was from but her cultivation was only at the Soul Transformation realm; she was a true junior. She was likely not much older than Frost Dream when she had participated in the Divine Realm First Martial Meeting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was clearly overdrawing her soul force trying to grasp the principles atop the shrine platform and was suddenly pushed away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming’s eyes and feet were fast. His figure flickered and he immediately occupied the shrine platform that the purple-clothed girl fell off from. Because he had a large figure, this small shrine platform was suddenly mostly taken up by him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This sudden movement caused many of the waiting martial artists to roll their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You…”</span></p>

She saw an overly tall and large dragon-bearded fellow suddenly rush onto the seat that was still warm from her body heat, and she flushed red with anger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What about it?” Lin Ming traced his thick beard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The purple-clothed little girl couldn’t find the words to speak. She could only give up on the shrine platform and fly up from the cliff in a huffy rage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Like this, Lin Ming started attempting to grasp the principles. In order to do that, he needed perception as well as luck. Even though so many years had passed, no one had succeeded. Some people even suspected that the Dao here had changed without them knowing it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming was also curious about what ‘enlightenment’ here really meant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming opened the Eight Inner Hidden Gates’ Gate of Opening. The Gate of Opening enhanced one’s perception. Moreover, Lin Ming’s Gate of Opening was not normal. He had perfectly opened the Gate of Opening, and this had provided Lin Ming with a terrifying enhancement to his perception.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When this was combined with Lin Ming’s understanding of the Asura Sutra and its countless and complex Asura runes, as well as his studying of the divine runic arts, his comprehension ability had reached a mind-boggling level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, Lin Ming entered a perfect ethereal state. He focused his heart and released his mind. Three fused martial intents appeared, and behind Lin Ming a Bodhi tree appeared, its sparse branches with their lush, jade-green leaves stretched out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In this immortal land of ultimate bliss, Lin Ming’s focus was as steady as an ancient lake that had never been disturbed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With all these conditions joining with each other, Lin Ming began to perceive the Laws of the shrine platform.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The runes marked atop the pillars of the shrine platforms began to flow into Lin Ming’s spiritual sea. Here, Lin Ming was like a little lonely boat, quietly drifting through a sea of Laws.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Laws of the shrine platform are similar in some ways to the Holy Scripture, but they are also completely different…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming’s eyesight was extraordinary. He was someone who had seen the Holy Scripture and Asura Sutra, and he could tell that the Laws of Fallen God Mountain Range’s shrine platforms were inherited from the Holy Scripture.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, even the aura here seemed to echo with the golden page he had on him, their true meanings superimposing upon each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In order to prevent any accidents from occurring, Lin Ming had placed the golden page into his inner world. As he touched his divine sense upon the page, a strange cord of resonance seemed to form.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Like this, Lin Ming sat in meditation for a day. He discovered that even though cultivating wasn’t good at the Fallen God Mountain Range, it was actually highly beneficial for him if he were only trying to perceive the mysteries of the golden page.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Slowly, Lin Ming gained an increasingly profound understanding of the second wood page. Three days later, Lin Ming could sense something extra in his spiritual sea. Because of this, there was a change to his spiritual sea, and with a light cracking sound, one of the carved clouds on Lin Ming’s shrine platform lit up with a sparkling light.</span></p>

But for a soul sea mark to emit such a blinding light after lighting up, that was actually extremely rare.</span></p>

He looked at the strongly shining soul sea mark and contrasted it to his own three dimly shimmering soul sea marks. At that time, Jade Lifestone felt as if 10,000 crows were flying above his head.</span></p>

The shrine platform that Lin Ming was sitting on had been hers, and when Lin Ming sat on it, it suddenly dazzled with a blinding light. But when she had tried, there had only been a dim glow.</span></p>

He is so old and hideous yet his comprehensions are so deep, and I am so cute yet… ugh…” The purple-clothed girl turned red with shame and no longer thought about it. After resting for three days her soul force had recovered and she could attempt the shrine platform again.</span></p>

Although Lin Ming’s comprehension ability was rare, it wasn’t too uncommon. Through the many years there were lots of people with achievements similar to Lin Ming’s, but in the end they had all fallen short.</span></p>

Otherwise, to light up the first soul sea mark in three days and also to such a degree – that was just unbelievable.</span></p>

Lin Ming had been at the Fallen God Mountain Range for a month and a half now. On this day, another soul sea mark lit up on Lin Ming’s shrine platform, dazzling with a blinding light.</span></p>
