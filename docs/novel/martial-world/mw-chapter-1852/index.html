But, the light of their soul sea marks would be dim, like a candle fading in the wind.</span></p>

If one did, they would inevitably become some great figure in the future.</span></p>

This was because those that failed all shared a common factor, and that was that they barely managed to open the fifth soul sea mark. However, Lin Ming and Sheng Mei’s fifth soul sea marks shined like stars and moons, shocking anyone who saw them.</span></p>

Rather, they were a profound inheritance left behind by the creator of the Holy Scripture. How much one could comprehend all depended on one’s ability.</span></p>

A thousand years after that when the Great Brahmic God King was almost 3000 years old, he returned to the Fallen God Mountain Range once more. At that time, he was a peak Great World King and nearly a half-step Empyrean, but his attempt at enlightenment remained unchanged from the past and he wasn’t able to light up the final soul sea mark.”</span></p>

He wasn’t like some True Divinities who slowly matured and only displayed their incredible potential during the World King or Empyrean realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this time, within the world of his mind, Lin Ming had used a full month but still wasn’t able to see the black shadow that Ruby spoke of.</span></p>

After Lin Ming comprehended a part of the Life Laws, he originally was able to absorb soul force from the world to restore himself, thus he didn’t need to rest. Even sitting in meditation for 10 years at a single time shouldn’t be a problem.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But in this world of death, the Concept of Life was suppressed and Lin Ming could feel the life force within him constantly leaking out. Once he exhausted the entirety of his strength, he would have no choice but to awake from his meditation and leave the shrine platform to rest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming didn’t want to give up halfway during his attempt at enlightenment. Trying to grasp the principles like this meant that he would have to comprehend from the start again and would waste a massive amount of time. Moreover, his comprehensions wouldn’t form a whole, making it so that there would be certain areas lacking in his enlightenment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ruby, is that person’s shadow there?”</span></p>

Ruby pointed towards a direction and said, “Over there, just 30 feet away, he’s killing a vicious beast!”</span></p>

He shot forwards like an arrow, firing straight towards the direction that Ruby pointed in. And the distance he went was exactly 30 feet!</span></p>

In that moment, Lin Ming thought he had really been killed! Even his fires of life began to rapidly fade away because of this strike!</span></p>

The shadow left and the vicious beast lay dead. As for Lin Ming, he had only been casually cut through.</span></p>

That strike had consumed a massive amount of his soul force, and he even thought that his spiritual sea would be sliced in half!</span></p>

All that was left over was the scythe formed from death itself, swallowing everything!</span></p>

It was impossible for the scythe phantom from 10 billion years ago to possess any material striking power. But the moment it cut across his soul force, he felt as if he had thoroughly died. This was because the blade contained the Concept of Death!</span></p>

He looked towards Ruby. Ruby’s small face was still ashen and she covered her wide mouth with her hands.</span></p>

She could easily see through everything but she also seemed to know nothing about the mysteries of the Laws.</span></p>

His entire body froze, eventually become bones.</span></p>

Dark clouds seemed to cover his face and a faint death energy exuded from his body. His strength rapidly passed away and he seemed on the verge of death. Eventually, even black blood began flowing out from the corners of Lin Ming’s lips.</span></p>

But before long, he was bursting with energy once more. Moreover, after Sheng Mei lit the fifth soul sea, Lin Ming had lit his fifth soul sea right after and the phenomenon that followed his was far superior to Sheng Mei’s. Those people that were mocking Lin Ming all had their faces slapped and their reputations torn down.</span></p>

Those people had been elites from Great Brahmic God Mountain, characters who had managed to become World Kings when they were a thousand years old and had high chances of becoming Empyreans in the future. These many proud children of heaven led an assault on Lin Ming, even posting a sky-high bounty reward so that the other young elites at the Fallen God Mountain Range would help strike down Lin Ming.</span></p>

When Lin Ming seemed on the verge of defeat, these people had stepped into the fray, hoping to pick up some small advantages, but finally, they met horrible ends.</span></p>

They glanced at each other, not sure what feeling was in their heart.</span></p>

They felt that her current situation was also poor. After all, when comprehending the Concept of Death it wasn’t easy for one to restore their soul force. Even someone like Sheng Mei had to suffer layers of problems as she tried to grasp the principles.</span></p>

But, she also faced endless death energy all around her. Even if Sheng Mei’s understandings of the Concept of Death had reached a nearly unimaginable level, she still found it hard to find a way out from this endless death energy in a short period of time.</span></p>
