By relying on this, he was greatly anticipating the final trial!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, in order to enter the final trial there was something he had to inevitably do. This was to experience numerous trials within the Asura Road, obtain multiple sets of god runes, and then complete all sorts of other conditions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And obtaining these god runes and satisfying all the conditions of the Asura Road was not easy at all.</span></p>

For instance, some missions were within mystic realms but these mystic realms only opened every ten years, so one might need to wait ten years for the chance to enter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And for these mystic realms that had missions, sometimes they were too far away and their entrance location was always changing, so entering them wasn’t easy. Even after finding the way in after great difficulty, one could still perish if their strength was lacking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In short, one needed to invest a massive amount of time and energy to obtain the qualifications for the final trial.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The great calamity of humanity could erupt at any moment and he also had a duel against the Good Fortune Saint Son that he had sworn to fight within a hundred years. Now, he had to cultivate the essence gathering system as well as prepare to further open the Nine Stars of the Dao Palace; that required him to practice the divine runic arts and alchemy. To him, time was of the essence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Mo Brightmoon mentioned the qualifications for the final smelting trial, Lin Ming’s thoughts inevitably stirred.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But for a time, Lin Ming didn’t open his mouth due to his embarrassment about asking of this matter. Luckily, Mo Brightmoon could see Lin Ming’s thoughts. She gently smiled and said, “The final trial qualifications could be said to be for one person, but the truth is that within the Asura Road there is a type of ‘collective transmission’ god rune. With this god rune, there can be a total of five people who enter the final trial together, forming a squad. Many young elites that enter the final trial form a team to continue onwards. If you wish, then when the true final trial begins I can bring you with me. With you, I’m sure that these final trial qualifications will not be wasted.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming was someone that Mo Eversnow had chosen, and the development of his strength was far more important than Mo Brightmoon’s strength. Moreover, Mo Brightmoon was well aware that becoming a Great World King was her limit. As for Lin Ming, his future was limitless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming was the most suitable candidate to join these final trial qualifications.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then I really must thank you… I really do need these qualifications. Moreover…” Lin Ming’s words lingered as he awkwardly turned to Xiao Moxian not too far away. As Lin Ming and Mo Brightmoon were talking, Xiao Moxian had been peacefully sitting near a window, not interrupting them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For Lin Ming to turn towards Xiao Moxian at this time, he clearly wanted to ask Mo Brightmoon whether or not she could also bring Xiao Moxian along.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Brightmoon chuckled. “I indeed had a candidate in mind, but no matter how good that candidate is they still cannot compare with your dao companion. I must say, I also don’t know Miss’ name, I’m quite ashamed of myself…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the start, Mo Brightmoon didn’t place too much importance on Lin Ming, only on the imaginary master that stood behind him. As for the young girl that followed Lin Ming, she had regarded her as Lin Ming’s partner and thus didn’t pay too much attention to her, not even asking for her name.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Moxian didn’t care too much about it. She clucked her tongue and happily said, “My name is Ji Xian’er, but you can call me Xian’er.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ji Xian’er… mm, that’s a good name. Then, Xian’er, Lin Ming, I, as well as two others I chose before, will be the five people to attend the final trial. Although it is said that we form a team, the trial will look further into our individual talent the further in we go. So Lin Ming, Xian’er, you two must display your talent to your limits.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Miss Brightmoon, please rest assured that I will not disappoint you for choosing us for those two spots.” Lin Ming solemnly said. He was sufficiently confident in himself as well as filled with expectations. “Speaking of which, when can we enter the final trial?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The final trial occurs every hundred years. Until the next opening of the final trial, there is still 50 years…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“50 years?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Min was stunned. This time had exceeded his expectations. He had only lived for 50 some years so far. If another 50 years passed, then he would almost be twice as old.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You think that’s too long?” Mo Brightmoon said, seeing Lin Ming’s expression. In the Asura Road, young elites came to adventure for a long time. On the shorter end it would be hundreds of years and on the longer end it could be thousands or even 10,000 years. There were even some people that never managed to leave after coming here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In reality, 50 years wasn’t anything at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m good.” Lin Ming quickly composed himself. He could wait for 50 years and there were also many matters he needed to attend to during this period that required a massive amount of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For instance, practicing the Celestial Tyrant Manual, collecting the heavenly materials needed to open the Nine Stars of the Dao Palace, practicing divine runic arts and alchemy, all of this required him to study them in detail.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, his cultivation had risen too quickly in Tragic Death Valley. He required some time to digest all of his accumulations and consolidate his own foundation. He had to do this sooner or later otherwise he would encounter bottlenecks when he was trying to rise to the next cultivation boundary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These 50 years would be an essential part of Lin Ming’s accumulation process.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for Lin Ming’s battle with the Good Fortune Saint Son, he originally had a hundred years of time. If 50 years were deducted he still had plenty of time to return. Although Lin Ming had stayed in Tragic Death Valley for nine years, that was time spent within a time enchantment; the truth was that only a year had passed outside.</span></p>

In these 50 years he would have to consolidate and accumulate his cultivation in the essence gathering system as well as make another breakthrough in the Nine Stars of the Dao Palace!</span></p>

This struggle for the throne isn’t something I will participate in. Besides White Sky, how many enemies does Miss Brightmoon have? After your recovery, will you be able to handle them yourself?”</span></p>

If it was only White Sky who wanted to enter then he could simply give Mo Brightmoon some advantages and join her team. But, he insisted on taking away the final trial qualifications, proving that he had a partner or had even gathered an entire team of five.</span></p>

I don’t fear them at all.” Mo Brightmoon had mixed in within the Asura Road and an assassin organization for so many years and had experienced numerous dangers and life or death slaughters. If she couldn’t overcome this tribulation then there was no way she could have lived this long.</span></p>

I feel that there is more than one type of dao pattern left behind in your body?”</span></p>

Can you undo them?”</span></p>

For instance, transmitting teammates, tracking enemies, controlling slaves, and so forth. Many people would use these as supportive arcane skills. When Lin Ming controlled Soulwhite he had also used a controlling god rune.</span></p>

He pointed towards a bed in the room and motioned for Mo Brightmoon to lie down.</span></p>

As Mo Brightmoon lay down on the bed, her long red skirt spread out like a rose in full bloom.</span></p>

Her skin seemed smooth to the touch, like soft jade.</span></p>

He sunk his divine sense into Mo Brightmoon’s inner world, investigating every dao pattern, locking onto their positions, remembering their structure and textures…</span></p>
