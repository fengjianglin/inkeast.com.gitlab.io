 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Hidden Dragon Galaxy was incredibly complex. It was filled with endless distortion force fields, space-time storms, space cracks, as well as fundamentally invisible black holes that could annihilate an Empyrean if they were to fall into one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two influences of human elites had gathered in the depths of this titanic galaxy.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With humanity’s understanding of the wild universe as well as the cover of the various galaxies, they were able to skirt around the saints. But slowly, there would always be some human influences that were discovered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was because human influences were simply far too large. The populations of these influences often reached into the quadrillions and quintillions and the star territories they occupied had dozens and hundreds of planets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Originally, a great number of humans had fled to the wild universe. Then, the leaders of humanity also adopted population-related policies that encouraged having more children. Like this, through several hundred generations, the population of humans in the wild universe exploded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This massive population base also involved countless Heavenly Palaces, spirit ships, sects, as well as a gargantuan number of low level martial artists. To have this giant force engage in guerilla warfare was easier said than done.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although those that evacuated to the wild universe were all elites of humanity, after over 6000 years of reproduction passed, there would always be some human descendants whose talent wasn’t particularly high. Although they would be capable of cultivating to the Revolving Core realm or Life Destruction realm, when it came to the great clashing waves of two races warring against each other, and in this wild universe that was filled with unspeakable dangers, they weren’t any different from mortals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In truth, these types of people were the overwhelming majority of humans that lived in the wild universe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, once a planet that had all its elites withdrawn was discovered by the saints, what occurred next would be brutal plundering and massacre!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The survivors of the carnage would become slaves, slaves that were reared in pens by the saints. They would become cannon fodder used to further expand their control of the wild universe in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since the wild universe was already opened to them, the saints had decided to simply eat this piece of fat meat and make it their territory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Like this, after another hundred million years passed, this wild universe would become the saint race’s ninth universe. If they managed to also wrest away the Asura Decree that was in the hands of Divine Dream, then they would also be able to easily open more paths into new universes and establish routes and bases in those new lands. The saints would be able to lay down seeds throughout the 33 Heavens until they finally became the number one race in existence!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>

A woman in black war armor stared out a window of this celestial palace, looking at a peaceful blue planet deep in the starry space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She gently sighed. Her ink black hair flowed down her back like a waterfall, brushing against her icy cold armor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She gently touched the window. From the surface of the crystalline window glass, her vague figure was reflected back. Although she was beautiful to behold, she seemed thin and haggard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was Lin Ming’s wife – Xiao Moxian.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Moxian now had subjects of her own…</span></p>

From the human younger generation, besides Frost Dream, she was the first one to step into the Empyrean realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To become an Empyrean meant that Xiao Moxian could no longer follow behind the elders and be a youth that was protected. Now, she shouldered the heavy mantle of duty and was responsible for her own vital tasks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the wild universe, every enclave of humanity needed an Empyrean to assume personal command. This was because wherever humans had gathered there was also the chance that an ancient Empyrean level vicious beast would come to raze and devour the cities. Without an Empyrean standing on guard the consequences would be unimaginable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The day Xiao Moxian broke into the Empyrean realm she had accepted the mission of protecting a land that had been developed by humanity. At the same time, she also gained her own subjects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because Xiao Moxian hadn’t been an Empyrean for too long, her territory consisted of a mere single planet – New Ming Planet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This planet was named by Xiao Moxian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone who first gathered at New Ming Planet had voluntarily come from other human enclaves. They were the first group of residents who decided to inhabit this wasteland and develop the planet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They sowed the seeds of humanity. Through their hard work and constant construction, New Ming Planet slowly became more and more prosperous.</span></p>

Husbands and wives would give birth to many children, increasing the population with every generation.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the overlord of this planet she had to protect her subjects from the chaos of war. They had come here because they had trusted her! How could she toss them away and flee by herself?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The war between the humans of the wild universe and the saints had already gone on for hundreds of years. Because the wild universe was far too vast and the inner workings of the galaxies were too complex and dangerous, as well the fact that some humans had already moved into another wild universe using the Asura Decree, the battlefield was just far too wide a stage. Searching for anyone was extremely burdensome, thus the advance of the saints was forced to slow down precipitously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But no matter how slow the saints were, they still only took several hundred years to find this place!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Hidden Dragon Galaxy now faced its own great war!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Moxian and the lives of the hundreds of billions of people that followed her and were shouldered by her, now stood against the army of the saints.</span></p>

It would be difficult for the legions of the saints to find this place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, no matter how well-hidden this planet, all mysteries were eventually grinded away by the saints through the use of time. Ten years ago, a saint race legion had sailed into a star domain near New Ming Planet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Moxian made a decisive choice. She took the initiative to lead the disciples of her Demon Fairy Celestial Palace to a place far away from New Ming Planet. Then, she purposefully revealed some flaws to the armies of the saints, allowing them to discover her before she escaped and led them away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Like this, Xiao Moxian was able to forcefully lead away the legions of the saints that had arrived at her doorstep.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The saint legions that chased after Xiao Moxian weren’t easy to deal with. They had two middle Empyreans in their ranks and they were also skilled in tracking techniques. Xiao Moxian with her vast number of disciples as well as her fleet of spirit ships was ultimately unable to rid herself of this tracking. So, after bringing the fleet of the saints to a desolate part of space that was quintillions of miles away and leaving the Hidden Dragon Galaxy, her forces suddenly turned around and engaged the saints in a life or death battle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This battle had been cruel and tragic. The two saint race Empyreans were completely killed off and their fleets were almost completely annihilated, but her Demon Fairy Celestial Palace also paid a deep price.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those brave warriors of Demon Fairy Celestial Palace who died in that battle were Xiao Moxian’s most loyal followers who had served her before New Ming Planet was even established…</span></p>

Without experiencing war it was impossible to understand the feeling of only being able to stare helplessly on as one’s comrades died all around them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But, even though Xiao Moxian’s heart was pained she quickly stood up and brushed herself off. This was because she knew that her followers all hoped to see a stronger her. So, she would carry their dying wishes upon her shoulders and continue leading the battle to protect New Ming Planet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, good fortune never came in pairs and misfortune never came alone. After these saint legions were destroyed by Xiao Moxian, an even stronger enemy approached.</span></p>

Finally, she cleaned out the battlefield. Xiao Moxian thought that her own identity hadn’t been leaked, but the arrival of the Good Fortune Saint Son meant that her whereabouts had likely been made known to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some matters were impossible to explain. Xiao Moxian didn’t know how the Good Fortune Saint Son had discovered her. Perhaps it was his intuition, perhaps he had found some clues, or perhaps his arrival was simply a coincidence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But in short, what Xiao Moxian now had to face was the head of the saint race’s five saint generals, the Good Fortune Saint Son, as well as the terrifying Legion of Famine!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Moxian originally didn’t fear the Good Fortune Saint Son at all. But presently, the Good Fortune Saint Son was in control of Famine’s avatar!</span></p>

As for Famine’s avatar, although it was weaker than its main body, it still had war strength close to that of a middle True Divinity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the hands of the Good Fortune Saint Son, the power that Famine’s avatar could display was greatly limited. Still, it must possess a strength similar to the weakest of True Divinities.</span></p>

When facing Empyreans, they were absolutely invincible!</span></p>

After undergoing their Famine-induced body metamorphosis, they would be able to fully contend with the weakest of Empyreans!</span></p>

Once both forces met, the battle would be no different from an egg trying to crack open a rock; there were no mysteries as to what would happen at all!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And even with all this, Xiao Moxian didn’t request any help from humanity’s headquarters.</span></p>

However, Divine Dream had to face the diversion of the two other True Divinities of the saint race – Soaring Feather God King and Astral Vault God King. As one person facing two, she was already burdened enough in dealing with them.</span></p>

The Monster Emperor’s great longevity banquet from over 6000 years ago was a thorn that forever pierced him. When given the chance to pull out this thorn, how could the Good Fortune Saint Son give up such an opportunity?</span></p>
