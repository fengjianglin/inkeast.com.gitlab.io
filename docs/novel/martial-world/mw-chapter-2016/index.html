Not every star territory that had been blockaded by the saints managed to stay in communication with Potala Galaxy. For instance, the Hidden Dragon Galaxy where Xiao Moxian was had already been severed from contact for a long time.</span></p>

Besides the Good Fortune Saint Son who wasn’t here, Soaring Feather God Mountain’s Fairy Blue Lotus, the two Empyreans Highsun and Darkmoon, as well as four other veteran peak Empyreans were here, composing a formidable war council.</span></p>

Within these 3000 World Kings, 200 were Great World Kings.</span></p>

But if 3000 World Kings gathered together, especially World Kings that had fused with the flesh and blood of Famine, and then laid down a joint attack battle array, their might could be imagined!</span></p>

Every time the Legion of Famine underwent body metamorphosis it would be greatly damaging to their blood vitality and would even reduce their lifespan. Thus, the Legion of Famine wouldn’t easily undergo body metamorphosis.</span></p>

Fortunately, the primal god race and celestials were also within Potala Galaxy, and the two peak Empyreans of Diwuhen and the Battle Sovereign were able to aid Mount Potala. But even so, as it stood, Mount Potala was barely able to hold on against the saints!</span></p>

If they were accidently surrounded somehow then they would lose everything!</span></p>

They were analyzing the current war situation. Just a day ago, an exciting piece of news had been passed onto them.</span></p>

They even lost around 300 members of the Legion of Famine! I really have no idea who did this…”</span></p>

He looked at Emperor Shakya and Great Limitless Buddha, wanting to elicit an opinion from the two leaders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Great Limitless Buddha didn’t speak.

But from the intelligence that our scouts have transmitted to us, this shouldn’t be the case. We have a fragment of a saint race Heavenly Palace that our scouts brought back.”</span></p>

The two of them both looked at this fragment but it was hard to say just what type of cultivation method had been used to damage it.</span></p>

It seemed divine, yet tainted with an evil aura. It was difficult to discern just what Laws it contained.</span></p>

Since childhood, this old monk has read through the book collections gathered within Mount Potala. Although my talent is lowly, I must confess that I believe my knowledge to be rich. But, the energy aura in this fragment is something that not even I can determine… it seems to contain a few characteristics of the power of divinity, yet that is also all I can judge from this…”</span></p>

Of those present, Emperor Shakya was considered the strongest. But in terms of experience, Great Limitless Buddha far outstripped everyone else. He had lived for an incredibly long time and was also experienced in Mount Potala’s rich accumulated history and knowledge. It was hard to imagine that such a knowledgeable Great Limitless Buddha still wouldn’t be able to analyze any clues about what this energy was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even fragments left behind by attacks from the Good Fortune Saint Sovereign weren’t difficult to identify. This was because no matter how strong the Good Fortune Saint Sovereign was, his powers primarily belonged to astral essence, the strength of one of the three great cultivation systems in the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This really feels strange…”</span></p>

This was because Lin Ming’s strength was fused with the power of divinity and the power of demons. This strength could be called unprecedented in history, something that perhaps not even the Asura Road Master or Immortal Sovereign possessed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In addition, the Laws that Lin Ming used were a fusion of the Asura Laws and Holy Scripture Laws. In front of the people in this hall, these two Laws stood at a peak of martial arts that they couldn’t even hope to see.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A strange strength, the peak of Laws, this left even the vastly experienced and knowledgeable Great Limitless Buddha at a loss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Concerning this mysterious person, we have a pitiful understanding about him. All we have are some eyewitness accounts. According to what they said, when this mysterious person destroyed the saints at Fire God Galaxy, a life form similar to a dragon appeared. It had a body that was a thousand miles long and its strength was astonishing! From descriptions it is similar to a Black Dragon with a royal bloodline, but its rear area is covered with spikes and its wings are as sharp as sabers. Its appearance is fiercer than could be imagined. From the way it was described, this life form could more appropriately be called a demon dragon.”</span></p>

A small projection cast a display in the air, showing an image of the Black Dragon. This was an image drawn up by Mount Potala’s scouts according to the descriptions of some eyewitnesses.</span></p>

After a long period of silence, he spoke up, and his words were shocking enough to fluster those present.</span></p>

Even for a peak Empyrean it is impossible to destroy five saint race bases in three months and also kill seven saint Empyreans at the same time. Even the numerous powerhouses of the saints were unable to escape… perhaps the saints are also confused and have thought that our human race have somehow managed to raise a secret ultimate weapon, but… we are well aware of our own matters. This is not the action of any of our human powerhouses. If so, then this matter is somewhat suspect. Only if…”</span></p>

It’s true that he needs to hide from the saints but there is no reason for him to conceal the truth from us… and right now, we don’t even know if the life form that appeared in Fire God Galaxy was a dragon. Even if it is a dragon, then according to the time that Lin Ming revealed the dragon egg, over 6000 years have passed. It is utterly impossible for a dragon egg to hatch and also for the dragon to grow to over a thousand miles long in this period of time…</span></p>

No matter how fierce Lin Ming was, he still shouldn’t have had some heaven-piercing method to deceive Soaring Feather God King when he was at the Holy Lord realm, right?”</span></p>

Sometimes, this information wasn’t even recorded in jade slips. This was because every army was continuously travelling and their positions were only revealed when the commanders contacted each other, and this was also only during times they needed to coordinate their movements. In other words, this information was all stored in the minds of the army commanders, so how would the mysterious person know this information?</span></p>
