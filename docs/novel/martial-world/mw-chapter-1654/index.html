Just when they thought Lin Ming was already strong, he always managed to show that he was even stronger than they imagined, leaving them all speechless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This celebration banquet continued deep into the night before it ended.</span></p>

As soon as the banquet ended, this news had already spread out wide into the city. As the many circles of divine runic masters learned of this, it was like a large boulder crashing into the world of divine runic arts, sending shockwaves rippling outwards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, Lin Ming didn’t bother with this. As soon as he returned from the banquet he locked himself back into his divine runic room.</span></p>

His skill in balancing intricate energy patterns as well as understanding the various changes in the Asura Laws had reached a new level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now, he was confident he had at least a 70% chance to successfully create the Soul Recovery Pill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Creating a Soul Recovery Pill consumed a massive amount of soul force. Moreover, there was an extremely strict environmental demand; the slightest fluctuation of outside energy could be catastrophic.</span></p>

His right hand whistled as a wisp of heavenly tribulation fire burst to life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, Lin Ming stretched out his left hand. He revolved the bloodline in his body and a tiny wisp of life essence left in his body from Xiao Moxian burst out, forming a black nirvanic flame that rose from his left palm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In essence, nirvana was a heavenly tribulation that a phoenix had to undergo. If they failed in their nirvana, even a phoenix would perish.</span></p>

They were both flames that were condensed from the Heavenly Dao Laws and their grades were almost the same.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The jet black flames twisted together with the blazing red flames, slowly spinning as they evolved into a strange array diagram in the array. The phantom of the Heretical God Tree appeared behind Lin Ming, and perched on this Heretical God Tree was a dark phoenix!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In these scorching flames, Lin Ming revolved his comprehensions of alchemy to the limit. All sorts of materials were fed to the flames where they dissolved into liquids.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From the start, Lin Ming didn’t take this process lightly nor did he dare to slack off. The soul force within his body gushed out like a wave, rushing into the furnace in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Runes appeared in his hand, shining with a black light. Then, they fused into the furnace…</span></p>

Because of the sweat that poured from his body being evaporated, a thin layer of salt appeared over his skin like frost.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He maintained a high intensity consumption of soul force until even he approached his limits. But at this time, the nirvanic flames and heavenly tribulation flames in his hands suddenly extinguished themselves. From the furnace, a mystic pill appeared, filled with a bewildering power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This pill was jet black. All rays of light that neared this pill were dragged into it and cleanly absorbed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a semi-complete Soul Recovery Pill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With Lin Ming’s current ability, he still lacked the skills to complete the Soul Recovery Pill in one session.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Following this, Lin Ming rested for two days. Then, he used three days to produce the best medicinal divine runic symbol that he could and placed it atop the Soul Recovery Pill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After finishing all of this, Lin Ming slumped back onto a stone chair, utterly exhausted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a full ten days, this Soul Recovery Pill could be considered more or less complete.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The pitch black Soul Recovery Pill was placed in a jade box. Its surface was smoother than jade, and as one looked into its shiny depths, it made one feel as if their soul was falling into it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a pill with the demonic charm of a soul. If a person with an unsteady will and mind were to look at it, they could even fall into illusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But even so, Lin Ming wasn’t satisfied with this pill’s effects. There were many places that had yet to achieve perfection, but this was also the best he could do within the constraints of his abilities. After all, it wasn’t easy to produce a pill that an Empyrean could use.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Lin Ming couldn’t wait. He had already been gone from Tragic Death Valley for nearly 30 years. According to the 10:1 time flow that occurred within Tragic Death Valley, nearly 300 years had passed there. Empyrean Divine Mist must have inevitably weakened during this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In a sense, it was fortunate that Empyrean Divine Mist had weakened this much because in his state even an imperfect Soul Recovery Pill would have a wondrous effect on him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming didn’t leave his room yet. Instead, he stayed in the divine runic room for another one to two months, producing another 50 Heavenly Fire Symbols and 50 Heretical God Symbols. He took these divine runic symbols and went looking for Suya.</span></p>

Moreover, Lin Ming had promised that he would help Suya. Lin Ming wasn’t someone that liked owing anyone favors. Once he left the Divine Runic Masters Guild there were many other matters he would have to complete. Not only did he have to return to Tragic Death Valley but he had to find a place to refine the Ravenous Wolf Heaven Pill and break through the second Dao Palace in the Nine Stars of the Dao Palace. After all of that was completed, there was still the final trial.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming and Xiao Moxian found Suya and handed the divine runic symbols to her. Suya was astonished, but she also had a faint feeling in her heart. “Sir Lin, are you planning on going on a long adventure?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mm…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming nodded, not hiding anything from Suya.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suya sighed. “You are a dragon amongst humans. The Divine Runic Masters Guild isn’t a place that can hold someone like you for long. But as for me, I must stay here. This war… if the Extreme Star Holy Lands win, then I will still stay at the Extreme Star Holy Lands until my old age… in the future, the most I’ll be able to become is the Internal Affairs Envoy. And if we lose, then there is nothing to say. But no matter what happens and where our fates bring us… I’m afraid that our roads won’t cross much…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suya didn’t know why she had such a feeling. But, this feeling was quite accurate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming remained silent. Suya was right. The most he would stay in the Asura Road was another 20 or so years. 20 years from now, after the final trial was complete, he would leave the Asura Road and return to the Divine Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Divine Realm was Lin Ming’s homeland.</span></p>

Even if he was nothing but a little tree in this great calamity, unable to do anything at all, Lin Ming still had to return.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because the human race was Lin Ming’s roots.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mm… I understand. Please, take care…” Suya took a deep breath and in this moment she seemed far thinner and paler. In truth, she and Lin Ming only had a cooperative relationship. At best, they could be considered casual friends. With such a light and pale relationship, she didn’t have any qualifications to speak out words to ask him to stay. But as she thought about parting here, and perhaps to never meet again, Suya couldn’t help but feel an inexplicable loss in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She wanted to say something but she eventually only looked at Xiao Moxian with envy in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Moxian paused. She suddenly felt that Suya, this Suya that she had loathed in the past, suddenly wasn’t so annoying. She bit her lips and hesitantly said, “Miss Suya, is there anything you wish to say that isn’t convenient? Perhaps it would be better if I left first?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Xiao Moxian’s response, Suya was stunned. Then, she chuckled, her smile bright and friendly. “It’s nothing special. I wish that you and Lin Ming can grow old together until your hair turns white, I wish that you two remain safe and happy, and I wish that your home will be filled with children and grandchildren, all of them dragons and phoenixes…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suya had finally said a blessing mostly used by mortals. As for the world of martial artists, although there were blessings and praises, they rarely ever mentioned growing old or having many descendants. This was because martial artists lived long lives and to them descendants were not an extension of their lives. There was also no need to bring honor to their ancestors. When blessings were given, it was usually to wish for others to have breakthroughs in their boundaries and for their strength to increase.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Suya suddenly spoke out this strange mortal blessing, Xiao Moxian blushed red. She didn’t know what to say for some time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, she immediately thought of something else and imperceptibly sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Between her and Lin Ming, it was impossible to have a home filled with children and grandchildren.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was because the more powerful a race was, the more difficult it was to bear children. God Beasts were the supreme example of this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even when two God Beasts of the same race came together, they might not be able to produce a child. As for Xiao Moxian, she was a half-phoenix. Her birth was a miracle of the universe, something that might not occur even within a billion years in the Divine Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With Xiao Moxian, her God Beast bloodline was already far paler than that of a true God Beast. But with Lin Ming, it wouldn’t be easy to have children. Although having children wouldn’t be as difficult as Xiao Moxian’s own birth, it wouldn’t be strange if she never became pregnant in hundreds of thousands or even millions of years. In the worst case situation, she would never have children of her own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking of this, Xiao Moxian was inexplicably moved. She couldn’t help but fear such a future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She wanted to have a child – a child that belonged to her and Lin Ming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming and Xiao Moxian’s minds were connected and he could faintly guess what she was thinking. He gently gripped her hand…</span></p>

He also went searching for Old Su and Old Xue and said his goodbyes to them too.</span></p>

After all, Lin Ming was far too valuable and had far too much wealth on him. Even if he had a supposed great master behind him serving as a deterrent, he couldn’t guarantee that some people wouldn’t decide to take the risk to kidnap him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He first changed his appearance with the Divine Dream Law. Then, Xiao Moxian hid away in Primordius Heavenly Palace. With this, he quietly left through a secret transmission network within the Divine Runic Masters Guild. He blended into the crowds of people and disappeared into the endless night…</span></p>
