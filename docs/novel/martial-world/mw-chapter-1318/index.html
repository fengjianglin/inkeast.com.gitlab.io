 <p><span style>Chapter 1318 – The Climactic Battle</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They are waiting for Lin Ming to wake up and compete with Frost Dream before they continue with the final battle? There must be some mistake!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As many spectators heard this, they were immediately roused to anger. Many of them had come to the First Martial Meeting specifically to watch Frost Dream, not Lin Ming. What did it matter to them if Lin Ming finished his matches or not? Moreover, Lin Ming had injured himself because he was trying to show off. If he missed his matches because of his wounds, how could anyone but himself be blamed?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The referees must have gone senile! If Lin Ming doesn’t wake up for a month, does that mean we have to wait for a month? If he doesn’t wake up for two months, do we have to wait for two months? Also, does anyone even think that Lin Ming can defeat Frost Dream? Frost Dream is someone who is said to far surpass Hang Chi, and Lin Ming lost miserably to Hang Chi, even suffering severe soul wounds in the meantime, so how could he possibly battle Frost Dream? They want us to take such a long break just to wait for him to fight a little teaser match?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is the intent handed down by the two great Empyreans. If you have complaints about how this First Martial Meeting is being conducted then why don’t you go and bring it up with them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As someone said this, the heroic young elite who was speaking before suddenly shut up. Go and complain to an Empyrean? He wouldn’t do that if he had 100 times the courage. Why would an Empyrean bother with the ideas of someone so unimportant. They wouldn’t even bother glancing in his direction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I heard that Lin Ming was placed in a time enchantment. One day out here is numerous days inside. He should wake up soon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Time enchantment? Is that okay? If he hasn’t woken up even after spending several months inside, then what’s going on? Is he dead?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many people were dissatisfied with the current situation but there was nothing they could do.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, like this, five days passed!</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the moment when Lin Ming entered the time enchantment, one year and three months had passed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s almost been 500 days. How come Lin Ming still hasn’t awakened?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Deep within Vast Universe Heavenly Palace, Empyrean Vast Universe frowned. It was clear that Lin Ming was suffering some sort of extremely complex situation, but his time deep in slumber had surpassed Empyrean Vast Universe’s estimations. “Divine Dream, could there have been something that happened to Lin Ming that damaged his spiritual sea and caused him to not be able to wake up?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Divine Dream was silent for a moment before slowly saying, “Have your disciple adjust the rate of the time enchantment to 1:150. Also, there is no need for Hang Chi and Frost Dream’s competition to drag on for such a long time. Once Lin Ming wakes up he can compete with Frost Dream.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Divine Dream’s words affirmed that Lin Ming would definitely wake up. Empyrean Vast Universe could only nod his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason that Divine Dream stepped forwards to conduct this First Martial Meeting was to a large extent because of Frost Dream. She also insisted that Frost Dream fight each and every great battle. And towards Lin Ming, Divine Dream had a faint premonition that his deep slumber was related to the Divine Seal Altar and wasn’t as simple as it seemed from the outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Like this, Lin Ming would surely become a good match for Frost Dream.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Xin Shenzi obtained the orders from above, he sped up the flow of time in the enchantment to 150 times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within a time enchantment, the more exaggerated the flow of time was, the more unstable the Laws within would be. In a time enchantment that ran 150 times faster than normal, it was hard to enlighten oneself on the Laws of the universe because they were simply too chaotic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, in his deep sleep, Lin Ming was absorbing the Laws that Empyrean Divine Seal had left behind. Because these Laws weren’t related to the outside, there weren’t any problems.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The four young jade bunny race girls attended to Lin Ming with utter care. As Lin Ming was sleeping, his face was determined and dashing, but his aura was also gentle and soft. From his appearance, it was hard to imagine the great dangers he was experiencing in his dream.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the dreamland space, the sphere of energy within Lin Ming’s inner world had expanded to the limit; it was ready to erupt at any given moment!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once it erupted, the impact on Lin Ming’s body would be unimaginable. If he couldn’t withstand it then his inner world would completely collapse and he would die.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he was able to withstand it, then after that true essence exploded, he could condense it into a black hole seed and thus begin the first crucial step to cultivating the Divine Seal Art!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming had already condensed the energy sphere for an entire month. Now, he was still adjusting himself, waiting, optimizing the energy to most the accurate proportion. This was an extremely risky step. Without certain assurances, Lin Ming wouldn’t play around with his own life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Lin Ming was cultivating without end, on the arena stage, Hang Chi and Frost Dream’s climactic battle was soon about to start!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This battle certainly had its own gambling bet. Vast Universe Heavenly Palace had already revealed their compensation rate. Frost Dream’s victory had a compensation rate of 1.3 and Hang Chi’s victory had a compensation rate of 2.7.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most people favored Frost Dream but there were also many people that favored Hang Chi. After all, Hang Chi was a very low profile individual, and in every match he fought so far he had always held back and never won in an excessive manner. Thus, it was hard to tell just where the limits of Hang Chi’s strength lay.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, when Hang Chi had fought Lin Ming and given him a severe soul wound, making him fall unconscious until even now, this matter had caused many people to hold Hang Chi in even higher regard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ming was a freak of nature after all; even Xiao Moxian had lost to him. For Hang Chi to defeat Lin Ming to such a degree was enough to prove how strong Hang Chi was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Also, Frost Dream’s compensation rate was simply far too low to have any fun. Even if one put down one billion they would only win 300 million; there simply wasn’t any meaning to this. Thus, many people bet on Hang Chi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Junior-apprentice Sister Frost Dream, this poor monk greets you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hang Chi stood on the arena stage, bowing respectfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Frost Dream’s eyes were calm and cold, her clothes floating around her. Even facing Hang Chi in what could be called the most important battle of the First Martial Meeting, her mood didn’t change at all. It was as if nothing in this world was able to change that look of hers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Match, begin!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Vast Cosmos announced this, the several hundred million spectators in the arena all began to wildly cheer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hang Chi took several steps back as a massive golden Buddha chart appeared behind him. A golden spinning halo of light also appeared beneath his feet. This was the Wheel of Samsara!</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the very start, Hang Chi displayed the Wheel of Samsara. One could see from this just how highly he thought of Frost Dream.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This poor monk has heard of Fairy Frost Dream’s renowned name for a long time. But, I have yet to have the good fortune of sparring with Junior-apprentice Frost Dream. This time can be considered as a wish fulfilled.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In Hang Chi’s eyes, a rare tint of fighting spirit shined.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As an ascetic, Hang Chi usually lived a modest and pious life. He had a naturally low profile temperament that avoided disputes and grudges. But, he too was a young heroic elite. To meet a similar opponent, that was something to feel excited over. This was what it meant to find a perfect rival; there was nothing better than that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Frost Dream’s entire body flowed with dreamy streams of water. She was using her divine dream space!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Up until now, Frost Dream had only used three moves to remain undefeated in the Divine Realm First Martial Meeting. One was illusions, the second was the Ruling Spirit Art, and the third was the divine dream space!</span></p>
 <p><span style>To deal with weaklings, Frost Dream only needed to glance at them to have them be lost in illusions and achieve instant victory.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But to deal with powerhouses like Xiao Moxian and Dragon Fang, she merely needed to envelop them in the divine dream space to win.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hu - !</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A cold air began to lift upwards. The entire timeless god stone arena was covered with a shimmering layer of condensed frost.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Frost Dream’s body floated in the air. Her feet were bare and her icy blue hair danced around her. The divine dream space had covered the entire arena!</span></p>
 <p><span style>As long as one stepped in this space, that was the same as stepping into Frost Dream’s ‘dream’. Within this dream, Frost Dream was god. All within it had to withstand the judgment of her will!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Xiu xiu xiu!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Vicious nightmare beasts began to appear within the divine dream space, one after another, all of them madly roaring towards Hang Chi!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hang Chi gathered his palms together, a smile on his face, “The divine dream space is truly magnificent. Then, this poor monk will make his move!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Hang Chi spoke, the Wheel of Samsara beneath his feet shot outwards, turning into a massive Dharmic wheel that hurtled into the sky towards Frost Dream.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ka ka ka!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The Dharmic wheel rapidly spun. As it flew forwards, all of the nightmare beasts it passed were cut apart, their blood sprinkling down!</span></p>
 <p><span style>If any of these nightmare beasts were chosen, any one of them had the ability to enter the top 20 rankings of the First Martial Meeting. But in front of Hang Chi’s Wheel of Samsara, they were nothing more than golems of mud, easily cut down!</span></p>
 <p><span style>In an instant, the Wheel of Samsara had arrived in front of Frost Dream!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Wheel of Samsara was both a material attack and soul attack. But, Hang Chi was well aware that soul attacks would have no effect on Frost Dream. He could only rely on a material attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the audience saw the Wheel of Samsara about to cut Frost Dream in half, many of her supporters, even though they knew that she had yet to reveal her true strength, cried out in sheer horror and alarm. This was still a transcendent divine might, and after being sent out by Hang Chi, its strength could be imagined.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In this critical situation, Frost Dream simply stretched out her slender right hand. “Infinite dreams, manifest a stone wall.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In that instant, endless starlight gathered into Frost Dream’s hand and a common-looking stone wall rose straight from the ground!</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the start when there was nothing on the ground, it only took a thousandth of an instant for a 100,000 foot high wall to rise into the world!</span></p>
 <p><span style>In that moment, a 100,000 foot high cliff had appeared in front of Frost Dream!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This stone wall was impossibly high and dreadful. It emitted a vast and boundless aura. Atop this stone wall was a massive ghostly head that looked incomparably fierce. It looked down at the world and grinned demonically.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Compared to this terrifying stone wall, the Wheel of Samsara looked like nothing but a tiny glass plate in front of a solid oak door. It was simply unworthy of mentioning.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The Wheel of Samsara cut into the stone wall. The Dharmic wheel spun around, crushing stone and sending shards of rubble flying everything, causing a tooth-aching sound to echo outwards. Finally, as the Dharmic wheel cut in just over halfway, it lost all power and thoroughly disintegrated!</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the audience saw this they were all shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just what kind of force was this!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The power of Hang Chi’s Wheel of Samsara was evident to all. Lin Ming and Xiao Moxian had both lost to this move! But in front of Frost Dream, it was so easily broken.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Frost Dream is too terrifying. Within her divine dream space, she is invincible. That divine wall was instantly created by her using the Divine Dream Laws. If she can make a divine wall, she can also make divine swords, divine spears, and anything else she wishes. Whether it is attack or defense, she has reached the limit in all aspects! If I hadn’t seen that Wheel of Samsara before, I would never have known how powerful it was. Even so, it is still useless in front of Frost Dream!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, the divine dream space is far too heaven-defying. Anyone that dares to fight Frost Dream within it is sure to lose. Hang Chi should have other methods, but I think that whatever he does is likely to be useless…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In just the first exchange, Frost Dream had suppressed Hang Chi’s transcendent divine might. As she did this, she had revealed the great strength of the divine dream space. It was simply a perfect offensive and defensive system!</span></p>
