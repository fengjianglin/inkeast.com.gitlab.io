As he looked down below at the numerous disciples of Demon Fairy Palace, his voice was grave and earnest.</span></p>

They thought that Lin Ming would speak some emotional words that would impassion them all, but they didn’t think this would be the first thing he mentioned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We know!” Many people loudly shouted out in reply.</span></p>

He looked at the vast sea of human martial artists before him and the swirling black nebula above. After a long period of silence, he finally opened his mouth and slowly said, “3.6 billion years ago, humanity was the same as it was today, facing a saint race that was several times more formidable. They had to face Famine in its peak state as well as saint Empyreans and saint True Divinities that were multiple times greater in number! The difference in strength was too great and humanity had no chance of winning. Through any logical reasoning, the only conclusion that could be made is that they would be annihilated and reduced to slaves. However, that war was one humanity won. Do you know what it was they relied on to win?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming’s question left the crowd dazed. Although they knew that humanity had also suffered a great calamity 3.6 billion years ago, the problem was that far too much time had passed and too many great influences had been destroyed, thus a great portion of history had been lost. They only knew that Empyrean Divine Seal had led the warriors of humanity to win that great war, but as for the exact details of how, they weren’t sure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“For a race to stand tall in the 33 Heavens, for a race to possess their own territory, for a race to have sovereignty, to have freedom, they must have great strength or their own bravery! The bravery of a race is that intangible desire condensed from the bloodline of the people, the power to fight for their dignity!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“3.6 billion years ago, humanity knew that their strength was far surpassed by the saints, but they were not afraid! Empyrean Divine Seal led the troops from the Divine Seal Altar! 200 Empyreans, 200 God Beasts, several million Holy Lords! With Holy Lords as soldiers, with Empyreans as generals, all of humanity joined forces to engage in slaughter with the saints! Finally, Empyrean Divine Seal brought numerous great hosts of humanity to voluntarily burn even their own lives to lay down a great array formation and seal away Famine’s soul!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In that great war, nearly all the Empyreans, World Kings, and Holy Lords of humanity died in battle. The great martial arts civilization of humanity declined. Our inheritances were cut off, and in order to redevelop all of this, endless effort needed to be paid. However, this was all worth it, because… we preserved… our dignity!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming said these last words clearly and without hurry. The entire audience was completely silent. The tens of thousands of disciples stood in the square or floated in the skies, respectfully listening. Their faces were filled with solemn respect and reverence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Because of the sacrifices our seniors made, we do not need to live like slaves! We have our own martial arts civilization, and although it is not the best, it is still ours! We have our own territory, our own homeland, and even though we only possess a single Heaven, we can still develop and restart from the beginning! However, as we truly began to develop and our martial arts civilization began to grow bright once more, the saints returned yet again! And this time, their ambitions were even greater!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Step-by-step, they want to gradually take control of the 33 Heavens. Their leader, the Good Fortune Saint Sovereign, wishes to merge together with Famine and finally swallow up the essence of every race in the 33 Heavens, taking a step Beyond Divinity. He regards the spiritas as his greatest opponent and our human race as a stepping stone. Yes, just like before two riders meet on the battlefield, they have to feed their horses grass. And our human race has been regarded as this grass.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming honestly spoke these words. As the martial artists of Demon Fairy Palace heard this, all of them began to stir with excitement. Many of them started to breathe heavily, the blood vessels straining in their necks as if they were about to erupt where they were. But as Lin Ming stood on the high platforms of the wall, no one spoke. This was because of their respect towards him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After several breaths of silence, Lin Ming suddenly asked, “Do you all think you are grass to feed horses?”</span></p>

There is Empyrean Primordius, who chose to become the incarnation of a demon to fight the saints to the death! There is Three Lives Old Man, who prolonged his life for 300 million years to wait for the great calamity, and finally sacrificed himself to buy time for the elites of humanity to enter the wild universe! Not just them… but there are numerous Empyreans, World Kings, and Holy Lords that we do not know the names of… as well as even more, countless martial artists of lower cultivation, and beyond them, there is also the common people who die cruel and tragic deaths. They all traded their lives for the chance for us to stand safely here today. Do you think that they did all that just so that we could be grass used to feed horses?</span></p>

We entered the wilderness, taking vicious beasts as our neighbors.
