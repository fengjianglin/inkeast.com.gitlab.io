 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When an ordinary martial artist broke into the Holy Lord realm, to someone on the level of an Empyrean, that was the same as a tiny bug breaking out of its cocoon. It simply wouldn’t arouse their interest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But, Lin Ming breaking into the Holy Lord realm left all the Empyreans present shocked speechless for a long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The half-step Holy Lord Lin Ming had already been strong enough to suppress the Good Fortune Saint Son. Then, just how strong would he be after becoming a Holy Lord?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If the current Lin Ming were to fight with the Good Fortune Saint Son again, just what sort of scene would that be?</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Today was the most frustrating day he had experienced in his life.</span></p>

Even so, the damage to his mortal body was nothing compared to the blow to his deepest feelings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In particular, after the battle finished, the seriously wounded Lin Ming had broken into the Holy Lord realm and had cast him further behind by a larger margin. When this was combined with the fact that Lin Ming was younger than he was, this left him unable to summon the courage to chase after him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your Highness Wumo…”</span></p>

When the saints invaded the Divine Realm, the Good Fortune Saint Son had won a series of victories. First he had led the grand army of the saints in an expedition through the Bright Luster World, obtaining countless accolades, and after that he had continuously challenged human World Kings and even a Great World King, beating them all one after another!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For the last several dozen years, the momentum of the saints had risen to the top of the wave. At the same time, the morale of humanity had been pushed into a pit. The Good Fortune Saint Son was originally someone with illustrious and nigh undefeated exploits, but today he had been defeated by Lin Ming and it had been an absolute loss!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The saint Empyrean didn’t know how to comfort the Good Fortune Saint Son. He could only say, “Your Highness, the day for our saint race to conquer the Divine Realm is not too far away. At that time… Lin Ming will absolutely not have had the time to grow. A dead genius is no genius at all…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the saint Empyrean spoke, the Good Fortune Saint Son didn’t seem to hear him at all. The Good Fortune Saint Son gripped his fists together, releasing explosive crackling sounds from his knuckles. He could not tolerate such a defeat. Even if the saints were to destroy humanity in the end, he had still lost to Lin Ming – this was an unchangeable fact as well as the ultimate disgrace of his life!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wumo! You have been defeated! According to our agreement, take out the methods for humanity to break into True Divinity as well as the Nine Orifices Exquisite Pill, and also cancel your marriage proposal to the demon race!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming grasped the Black Dragon Spear and pointed it towards the Good Fortune Saint Son. Killing intent gushed out from his body, forming a sound like rolling thunderclaps that stunned the world!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this time, because Lin Ming had just made his breakthrough, his originally damaged body and energy had been restored by over half. Thus, as he spoke, his aura was extremely powerful. The sound waves of his voice caused space to shiver and the already severely wounded Good Fortune Saint Son found this difficult to withstand. His body shook and his complexion paled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The saint Empyrean beside him released a wisp of astral essence and poured it into the Good Fortune Saint Son. Only then was the Good Fortune Saint Son able to relax.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To the Good Fortune Saint Son, this was an unprecedented humiliation. In the past, when hadn’t it been him who had used his aura to suppress and frighten others? Even when Empyreans were present, the Good Fortune Saint Son was still able to rely on the Grandmist Spirit Bead in his body to remain composed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But now, his meridians and organs were damaged and his astral essence was in utter chaos. He was completely unable to stimulate the Grandmist Spirit Bead at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had been entirely suppressed by Lin Ming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Good Fortune Saint Son gnashed his teeth and glared at Lin Ming with eyes that could kill. He waved his arm and two jade slips and a pill box shot out like arcs of lightning!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pa!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The jade slips and pill box fell into Lin Ming’s hand. The pill box shattered, immediately revealing a longan-sized pill. The pill was a deep green and had a fragrance that warmed the heart and mind. This was the Nine Orifices Exquisite Pill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Nine Orifices Exquisite Pill was a pill whose grade neared the True Divinity level. It had been personally refined by the Good Fortune Saint Sovereign and the materials used to refine it were extremely rare. It was a true miracle medicine for body transformation martial artists. For Lin Ming, it was extremely useful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the two jade slips, they were True Divinity cultivation methods that could be used by humans. One was relatively complete and one was extremely incomplete.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming cultivated the Asura Heavenly Dao thus these jade slips weren’t too useful to him. But for the Empyreans of humanity, their significance was completely different!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the many human Empyreans present looked at the two jade slips in Lin Ming’s hand, their eyes shined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These were human cultivation methods for breaking into True Divinity!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the great calamity 3.6 billion years ago, the inheritances of humanity had been severed and breaking into the realm of True Divinity had become a myth that was no longer possible. To the Empyreans of humanity, this had become a pain forever lodged in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although they were clearly aware that even with these two sets of cultivation methods it was still incomparably unlikely for them to become True Divinities, there was still a ray of hope. For those dedicated to traversing the road of martial arts, what they feared the most was not that it was dangerous or arduous, but that there was no hope to continue at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For a time, the several human Empyreans present couldn’t help but use their senses to probe the jade slips. Hope shined in their eyes without reserve.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Each one of them had extraordinary levels of experience. They were naturally able to see that these jade slips weren’t fakes, but real True Divinity level cultivation methods!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Humph! These half-dead geezers, do they really think they can break into True Divinity with this? Even if I gave them the jade slips it would still be useless!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Good Fortune Saint Son ferociously thought in his heart. Not only was becoming a True Divinity nearly impossible, but even if they could, who knew when that would happen? When an Empyrean cultivated, they used millions of years or hundreds of thousands of years as the unit of time. In the Good Fortune Saint Son’s eyes, humanity would have long perished by then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even so, these two jade slips that Lin Ming won had an extraordinary significance for humanity…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lin Ming, you have really helped us a lot…”</span></p>

Beside him, Empyrean Divine Dream also slightly bowed. Although these two True Divinity cultivation methods didn’t have much use to Lin Ming, he had still put forth the Black Dragon Spear in a gambling bet with the Good Fortune Saint Son. And, that Black Dragon Spear was definitely highly significant to Lin Ming!</span></p>

Otherwise, humanity wouldn’t even need the saints to attack. There would inevitably be traitors in their ranks that would cause humanity to be in an even more precarious position.</span></p>

As she looked at Lin Ming, there was a complex emotion in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Divine Realm First Martial Meeting was when Divine Dream had first seen Lin Ming. At that time, Lin Ming had still been weaker than Hang Chi and Frost Dream and his talent was slightly inferior to that of Xian Moxian. Back then, she had only paid a minor amount of attention to him, not attaching too much importance to him in her heart. She never imagined that so many years later, Lin Ming would have such legendary accomplishments!</span></p>

I fear that in another 100-200 years… Lin Ming will catch up to me…”</span></p>

He felt nothing but heartfelt joy at seeing Lin Ming’s breakthrough but he also felt it was unbelievable. 100-200 years from now, Lin Ming would only be a few hundred years old. To have strength comparable to an Empyrean at this age was mind-boggling.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In this grand world, heroes will pour forth from the ranks. At that time, Lin Ming will inevitably be the one leading them. As for the other young elites, they will surely shine brilliantly, but no matter how dazzling they are they still won’t outshine Lin Ming…”</span></p>

At that moment, Empyrean Vast Universe felt the true weight of his age.</span></p>

Only Empyrean Divine Dream, Great Limitless Buddha, Emperor Shakya, Empyrean Demondawn, and other such peak Empyreans had the ability to stand upon the stage of the world. For them there was even a faint ray of hope that they could take one more step forwards and break into the realm of True Divinity!</span></p>

With a wave of his arm the two jade slips shot out and fell into Divine Dream’s hand.</span></p>

If the jade slips were given to her it would give her words that much more weight. After all, Divine Dream was only the nominal leader of humanity and many Empyreans might not be willing to listen to her. But with these two jade slips, she would be the one controlling power and authority. Just who would dare not listen to her?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Divine Dream grasped these two jade slips that were still warm from Lin Ming’s touch and heavily nodded. She would receive this gratitude. Although Lin Ming owed a graciousness to her, it was far inferior to how Lin Ming had just repaid the favor.</span></p>

He had to make use of this remaining time as well as he could and increase his strength as much as possible!</span></p>
