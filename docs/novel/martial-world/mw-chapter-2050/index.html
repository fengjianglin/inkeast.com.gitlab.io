There, he had wanted to pay a price in order to facilitate an alliance between humanity and the spiritas. But the result was that his proposal had been refused by Sheng Mei. Now that he thought of it, this was also completely normal. Whether it was the Soul Emperor or Good Fortune Saint Sovereign, both of them thought that humanity was nothing but a tiny chess piece within the grand game they were playing. If humanity were to undergo a great apocalyptic calamity in which they went extinct, this would be no different from a chess piece being taken off the board.</span></p>

He thought of the thoughts he had at the time, the thought of being hunted down by Soaring Feather God King and then being shifted into the Sky Spill Planet by Sheng Mei, and even the sad face she had when she left after stealing away his source soul force…</span></p>

Lin Ming shook his head. “It’s nothing. I was just recalling some past events… I’m worried about what the spiritas are planning…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Lin Ming met up with Xiao Moxian, Mu Qianyu, and Qin Xingxuan, he had six hours before his battle with the Good Fortune Saint Son. During this time, Lin Ming recounted his experiences to them, and Xiao Moxian also learned about Sheng Mei and the Soul Emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiao Moxian didn’t continue this topic.

He suddenly remembered that in the backup troops that came, there were few ships but their war strength was incredible. Yes, in the Hidden Dragon Galaxy there was not just Xiao Moxian but also Dragon Fang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During these past years, both forces had worked together to harass and divert Good Fortune Saint Son. Dragon Fang was slightly weaker than Xiao Moxian and Xiao Moxian also had Lin Huang at her side. It was obvious that Dragon Fang had a much more difficult time surviving in the Hidden Dragon Galaxy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking about it, Dragon Fang shouldn’t have been too far away from this area. So, when he saw the light from the massive explosion, he rushed over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Dragon Fang broke into the Empyrean realm.” Xiao Moxian suddenly said.</span></p>

Dragon Fang was about his age, and to break into the Empyrean realm at 6,000-7,000 years of age was a bit too exaggerated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this was likely because of the great calamity. With the arrival of disaster, many geniuses grew rapidly. If this calamity continued on and more and more human martial artists perished, there would also be more powerhouses that rose from their ashes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the tides washed the sand away, true gold would emerge. To the weak this great calamity was a living hell, but to geniuses this great calamity was a stage set for their growth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lin Ming thought for a moment and then took out a jade slip from his spatial ring. This was the sound transmission mark of the Mount Potala Wartime Alliance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was about time for humanity to reunite.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Currently, the invincible forces of the saints had been slowly whittled away. Although humanity couldn’t engage in a counterattack, they could at least resist the saints head-on before the Good Fortune Saint Sovereign left seclusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, there was something else he wanted to do. Lin Ming wanted to find out news about Mo Eversnow through the human intelligence network. According to what Xiao Moxian knew, Mo Eversnow had left early on in the great calamity, and as for where she went, Xiao Moxian didn’t know. But Mo Eversnow had brought Fishy away with her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There might be some human Empyreans that would know where Mo Eversnow had gone…</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…..</span></p>

A tall and robust middle-aged man strode in, a group of silver-armored warriors following close behind him. As these silver-armored warriors saw Lin Ming, visible excitement shined in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This middle-aged man was Empyrean Vast Universe. Empyrean Vast Universe stretched out a hand and slapped Lin Ming’s shoulder. “I knew it! I knew a brat like you wouldn’t have died so easily! It’s been 6,500 years and you’ve finally returned! Good! Too good! This is just far too good!” Empyrean Vast Universe shouted, his complexion beaming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the past, he and Divine Dream were the human Empyreans who had noticed Lin Ming’s capabilities first. At the time, Empyrean Vast Universe only thought Lin Ming was a genius with excellent talent who would become an Empyrean in the future. He even believed he had underestimated in his judgment of Lin Ming, but he never thought that his underestimation would be so great. Now, Lin Ming was already able to create the miracle of reversing this war.</span></p>

When the saints began their full invasion of humanity, the human elites had to evacuate the Divine Realm to guarantee the continuation of their inheritance. In order to safely arrive at the wild universe, the armies of the human Empyreans, led by Divine Dream, had to go to Bright Luster World to block the advance of the saints.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And Empyrean Vast Universe had been one of these brave Empyreans. Lin Ming knew that Empyrean Vast Universe’s strength wasn’t considered strong amongst the many human Empyreans and he worried that Empyrean Vast Universe would perish in battle. After all, this was an elder that he respected and he also appreciated Empyrean Vast Universe for having recognized him in the past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Lin Ming saw Empyrean Vast Universe standing alive in front of him, he was overjoyed from the depths of his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, don’t call me senior anymore! Boy, you are the hero of humanity. If Divine Dream were to see you now, she would definitely be happy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior Divine Dream…” Lin Ming’s thoughts stirred. “I heard Senior Divine Dream was fighting two other saint True Divinities in a different wild universe. How is the current situation?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Empyrean Vast Universe shook his head. “I don’t have much of an understanding about how she is doing. When Divine Dream sent a message to me, she instructed me on how humanity should continue the war… and she also conveniently mentioned that she was engaged in battle with two True Divinities…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh? What instructions did Senior Divine Dream give?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It was very simple, just a single word – endure. Divine Dream wants the various human forces to go into hiding and not to directly confront the saints. We’re to use guerilla tactics to engage them in order to drag out as much time as we can. Now, it seems that we really managed to wait for our favorable turn to appear!” Empyrean Vast Universe laughed once more. Lin Ming’s appearance had truly been their favorable turn.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“As for Divine Dream’s current situation, I only know the approximate difference in strength between her and the other two True Divinities. If Divine Dream and Soaring Feather God King were to be compared alone, it’s hard to say if either of them could truly harm the other. But if Divine Dream were to face Astral Vault God King, she has a considerable superiority over him. This is mainly due to the height of the Laws they cultivated when they stepped into True Divinity and also because her cultivation methods naturally restrain his. Astral Vault God King has a formidable mortal body, but he is weak when it comes to the spiritual sea and mental strength. Against someone like Divine Dream who is familiar with illusions and soul attacks, he suffers far too great a loss. Divine Dream said she used her divine dream space to trap Astral Vault God King and then she was able to lead Soaring Feather God King around. Like this, she was able to fight one against two.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But this is also because Astral Vault God King and Soaring Feather God King have no intentions of going all out against Divine Dream. If they did, Astral Vault God King could simply burn his blood essence and even if he can’t see through the illusions of the divine dream space, he can still use brute force to break through the divine dream space’s force field enchantment.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I see…” Lin Ming let out a sigh of relief. He was originally afraid something might have happened to Divine Dream since she was fighting one against two, but it seems the situation was better than he hoped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, you don’t need to worry about Divine Dream. I’ve known her for more than 10 million years and I personally know just how fierce she is. In the past, she and I both participated in a great tournament similar to the Divine Realm First Martial Meeting. Afterwards, we adventured together, passed through dangers together, and explored mystic realms together. She has always been creating miracles. Between her and I, our relationship is just like…” As Empyrean Vast Universe spoke to here, a thoughtful expression crossed his face. He laughed and said, “It’s just like you and Hang Chi. You always seem to be making moves that defy all common sense, and when it comes to you, there doesn’t seem like there is anything that is impossible. As for Hang Chi, he’s an honest and diligent person who works hard on his cultivation, just like me! These days, honest people like me really find it hard to keep up, haha!”</span></p>

In the last six thousand some years, he hadn’t smiled so brightly and openly.</span></p>

A part of them were Holy Lords, some were young Divine Lord powerhouses, and there were even some Divine Transformation realm juniors who weren’t strong enough to enter the battlefield and were only part of the reserve forces.</span></p>
