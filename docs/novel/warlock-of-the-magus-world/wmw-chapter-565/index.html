 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong> Fire Phoenix</strong></span></p>
 <p>Leylin walked out of the inn, with the hypnotised boss and attendants left behind.</p>
 <p>After he left, these people would forget his appearance and him having been there at all, and would not even doubt their memories. This was a spiritual force intent planted deep in their minds.</p>
 <p>He had learnt this technique from the Spirit Circle Warlock, Paul.</p>
 <p>He returned to the station to find Schiker waiting for him, having come in secret. After a lengthy conversation with him, Leylin was left wanting to both laugh and cry as he looked at the item on the table.</p>
 <p>This was a little book with a fiery-red cover. Within was the information on the tenth level of the fire feathered technique!</p>
 <p>Schiker had come over just to give him this. The tenth level of Fireplume that had been on Leylin’s mind had landed in his possession quite easily.</p>
 <p>“I don’t know how to react…” Leylin commanded the A.I. Chip to destroy the book after recording the thing down. “But it looks like he has gotten rid of all suspicion towards me…”</p>
 <p>On top of that, the item he had been desiring had landed in his palms. Leylin was in a pretty good mood.</p>
 <p>[Beep! Recording of tenth level of Fireplume complete. Beginning analysis…] The A.I. Chip’s voice sounded, and Leylin carefully looked through the contents in his memory bank.</p>
 <p>Compared to the ninth level, the tenth touched on the Morning Star Realm, and was a path that focused on strength. Given that this had the unique characteristics of a foreign world, Leylin believed it would have very high research value.</p>
 <p>Many ancient Magi were all-embracing, incorporating these paths from other worlds into their own systems to advance. By making use of others’ strengths to make up for their own weak points, they had been able to achieve the splendour of the ancient era. And Leylin, too, wanted to do the same!</p>
 <p>“The tenth level of Fireplume!” Leylin’s expression gradually became solemn.</p>
 <p>The more he watched on, the more he felt that the person who had created this technique had a talent that was off the charts. This was definitely a powerful technique that could contend against many other top-grade meditation techniques!</p>
 <p>As the A.I. Chip’s analysis progressed, Leylin’s aura gradually changed.</p>
 <p>Within his body, the boiling hot energy from the ninth level of Fireplume gradually purified and turned transparent, emanating a frightening might.</p>
 <p>Large amounts of fire elemental crystals appeared, and even seemed to turn into a whirlpool.</p>
 <p>*Skreee* A high-pitched phoenix cry sounded by Leylin’s ear. It felt as if his spiritual and soul force had made a connection with some unique existence!</p>
 <p>At the bottom of an abyssal starry river, a giant, terrifying beast with a body that spanned several worlds suddenly opened its eyes, gazing at Leylin coldly.</p>
 <p>“Could this be the legendary ancient fire phoenix? With this aura, it’s probably the king or even primogenitor of fire phoenixes!”</p>
 <p>Leylin knew very well that even if what he saw was merely a phantom, such an ancient existence was mysterious and difficult to fathom. It could perhaps even use its phantom to display its strength.</p>
 <p>The rage in the phoenix’s eyes caused Leylin to feel a biting cold.</p>
 <p>‘Crap, it’s realised that I’ve been wearing a disguise!’ A thought flashed in Leylin’s mind, and immediately after he sensed a tremendous crimson current flooding towards him.</p>
 <p>*Rumble!* The sound of shattering was heard in Leylin’s lower abdomen, and he immediately turned pale, spitting out a mouthful of blood. His expression, however, was that of rejoicement.</p>
 <p>“Luckily, I’ve already condensed my point mass!” Leylin could still feel fear as he looked into his body.</p>
 <p>His point mass, which had already turned silent, had suddenly appeared when Fireplume was writhing, ready to break through to the tenth level. That had shaken the crimson energy essence that had gathered and broken the process of the advancement to the tenth level of Fireplume, the Star rank. For this reason, Leylin had been pulled out of that dream-like fantasy, or else the consequences would be dire.</p>
 <p>“That fire phoenix that was like a world itself… Could it be the ancient lord of phoenixes?”</p>
 <p>Leylin recalled that terrifying giant fire phoenix. In his mind, it could only be compared with existences such as the Snake Dowager, Trial’s Eye, and a few others.</p>
 <p>“It looks like Fireplume and the fire phoenix have a relationship, and the tenth level of Fireplume requires connecting with the fire phoenix, and even withstanding the corruptive power radiating from it. Of course, the Emberwings would call that power an additional boost”</p>
 <p>The true body of the tremendous fire phoenix was obviously not here, but with sacrificial rites, or other techniques absorbing some sort of energy, disseminating power was a method used by many existences to traverse worlds.</p>
 <p>If not for Leylin having already reached Morning Star and having his own path, forcefully interrupting the advancement of Fireplume might have immediately caused his death at its hands!</p>
 <p>‘So Fireplume at the Morning Star rank is a path of sacrifice! By offering sacrifices up to the ancient fire phoenix or even changing one’s bloodline, one will ultimately become part of its family…’ Leylin touched his chin. These methods were similar to the belief in various gods, but was still different. Gods focused on quantity, while the path of sacrifice was passed on on a large scale, but then focused only on the elites. It was more like a chosen community of its own.</p>
 <p>Leylin’s expression grew grim, as he thought of something, ‘These methods, this feeling of being suppressed...it’s very similar to the rule of the Snake Dowager…’</p>
 <p>“A.I. Chip, begin modification of Fireplume. Moderate the force of point mass and simulate fusion of the two, eliminating the possibility of being controlled via sacrifice…”</p>
 <p>Since he would attract attention from the fire phoenix after reaching the higher levels of Fireplume, Leylin obviously would not persist. However, he was rather interested in modifying the technique and fusing it into the Magus World system.</p>
 <p>In the ancient era, these thoughts had been proven countless times to be workable. On top of that, the element he had the second most affinity with was the fire element, and in this area he had a natural advantage.</p>
 <p>This led to an even more insane thought.</p>
 <p>‘Since all this has to do with the bloodline, meditation techniques and controlling cultivation pathways, I can probably make use of this Fireplume and find ways to deal with the Snake Dowager…’</p>
 <p>Leylin’s eyes turned darker. He was unwilling to serve beneath anyone, and while he had not gained the attention of the Snake Dowager yet, he could not tolerate the idea of being manipulated. He was already preparing for the day that will eventually come.</p>
 <p>Whether it was attempting to break through bloodline shackles or abandoning the bloodline restraints from meditation techniques, it was all for this cause.</p>
 <p>‘Where is the fun in having immortality at the peak yet being under the oppression of another?’ A trace of profound thought flashed in Leylin’s eyes.</p>
 <p>[Beep! Beginning fusion simulation, mobilising 80% of task resources. Tenth level of Fireplume, meditation technique Kemoyin’s Pupil… Estimated time: 16 days, 14 hours, 34 minutes and 56 seconds…]</p>
 <p>The A.I. Chip loyally intoned.</p>
 <p>After Leylin had entered the Morning Star realm, its calculations and simulation techniques had been reinforced, and the time limit set was now precise to the second. This was a rare occurrence while simulating techniques in the past.</p>
 <p>“16 days? It will be completed right before the Holy Solar Festival. That’s not bad!” Leylin touched his chin, rather satisfied with this outcome.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>In the residence of the leader, at the deepest part underground.</p>
 <p>Boiling heatwaves of hot lava expanded and withdrew, but were unable to advance due to an isolated maroon spell formation.</p>
 <p>Within the maroon spell formation, there were many crowded buildings that formed a large number of private rooms.</p>
 <p>In one of them, the leader, with his red brows and hair and young looks, was now meeting the gaze of another black figure in a mirror on the ground.</p>
 <p>The figure in the mirror donned loose, majestic Magus robes, with a moon rune on his forehead. Those eyes were now filled with fury.</p>
 <p>Zegna’s voice was low. “Scarlet Eye! You obviously knew that the Mobius Organisation was mine, and yet you still made a move? On top of that, there’s the fall of Collins as well. You need to take responsibility for it…”</p>
 <p>The leader of the Atlan Union, Scarlet Eye, snorted. “When we last communicated, I reiterated many times that the Atlan Union is my territory, and I won’t let any outsiders spy on us, particularly Magi from other worlds. You seem to have forgotten that, my friend.”</p>
 <p>Zegna, who was in the mirror, sighed lightly as if finding this a pity. He obviously knew what was taboo to the other party, but how could he have a large world right there but not do anything about it?</p>
 <p>“But a Morning Star from our end has fallen! Do you know how much resources we would need to compensate that?” Zegna’s voice became sharp.</p>
 <p>“Based on the intel from my subordinates, he was already seriously injured and on the verge of perishing when we found him. Those three enemies of yours had attacked him…” There was a hint of schadenfreude in Scarlet Eye’s voice.</p>
 <p>Zegna’s voice was stilted, and he was slightly regretful.</p>
 <p>When he had used this world and set a trap, he had been absolutely confident in taking care of the three dukes. That was why he had not minded the leaking of this world’s coordinates. However, he had grossly underestimated his opponents’ abilities, and they had used quite a few bloodline treasures to break free from their trap forcefully and descended down to this world. That had made things very troublesome for him.</p>
 <p>If he could turn back time, he would probably not do the same thing.</p>
 <p>“Besides… you have not kept to your word. Trading between us needs to be halted for a period of time…” Scarlet Eye tossed him a heavyweight bomb.</p>
 <p>“No!” Zegna immediately cried out, and instantly saw the mocking smile on the other person.</p>
 <p>He lowered his head unwillingly, but said little more. The other party did not mind losing the support of his technology, but he could not let go of the firasource stones. That was his only hope at having a glimpse into the Breaking Dawn throne!</p>
 <p>Hence, he had no choice but to duck his head and gentle his tone. “Revered leader, I’m afraid we both have to take some responsibility, but this shouldn’t affect our friendship…”</p>
 <p>“That’s right, my friend! As a cost of you violating the promise between us first, you will need to halve the price of the secondary element balancing spell formation you promised the last time!”</p>
 <p>“Alright!” Zegna was practically gritting his teeth as he agreed.</p>
 <p>When the communication was closed off, he stood up while roaring. The black throne under him continuously creaked, terrifying air waves dissipating in all directions.</p>
 <p>“I’ll definitely kill that Scarlet Eye someday and roast his soul above my Magus Tower for ten thousand years!”</p>
