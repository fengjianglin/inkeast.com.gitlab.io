 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Seal of the Dark Corrosion&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
 <p>The corrosive black flames were like a chasm which separated Toram from the rest.</p>
 <p>As for the other rank 3 Magus? The flames had inflicted him with heavy injuries, and he had escaped to the side while letting out blood-curdling screams.</p>
 <p>”What… What are you trying to do?” At that moment, the tiger skull Magus was truly terrified. He felt the increasingly horrifying strength emitting from both of Leylin’s hands, and the savage spiritual force which had sealed his sea of consciousness. For the first time, he felt terror from the bottom of his heart.</p>
 <p>He began to regret not escaping immediately upon Leylin’s arrival. Because of that, he had landed himself in his current circumstances.</p>
 <p>”What I’m trying to do?” Leylin’s lips curled up. Shadow arms emerged from his back in rapid succession. Enormous muscles emerged indistinctively, and fused onto both of Leylin’s hands.</p>
 <p>*Creak! Creak!* First, the skin ruptured, then the muscles, then the bones.</p>
 <p>The tiger skull Magus had a twisted expression, and was in so much pain that he could not even make a sound. His entire being seemed to have been stretched apart by Leylin.</p>
 <p>”Let him go! Wait! NOOOOO….” Amidst Toram’s blood-curdling screams, the tiger skull Magus was ripped into two. Large amounts of bloodshed could be seen everywhere.</p>
 <p>”Don’t you think it’s too late to say these things only now?” Leylin expertly avoided the blood, a skill he’d acquired from experience. His body had not even been tainted by a smidgen of it.</p>
 <p>As if tossing out the garbage, he threw away the two segments of the corpse before turning towards Toram, his face emotionless. “You should have come to your senses before you decided to rebel against the Ouroboros Clan!”</p>
 <p>”You’ll perish here today! This is my promise to Borgin!” Toram’s face instantly calmed down. Still, Leylin could very distinctively see the desire for vengeance in her eyes.</p>
 <p>This was not a hot-blooded vengeance that arose merely from this one incident. It was rather a collective response to the extended period during which they were hunted down like prey. Many of Toram’s friends and family presumably died amidst the massacres conducted by the Ouroboros Clan, and Leylin’s actions earlier had fully evoked her wrath.</p>
 <p>”Even now, you refuse to learn!” Leylin shook his head.</p>
 <p>”Currently, you don’t seem to be fit to be my opponent. Let me give you a hand!” Just as he finished these words, a Magus dressed in a black robe, who looked identical to Leylin, suddenly emerged before the rank 3 Magus who had been seriously injured by the Arm of Vengeance.</p>
 <p>A few multi-coloured potions were thrown out by “Leylin”, as he kept a straight face. They collided in mid-air and emitted terrifying energy ripples.</p>
 <p>”Rank 3 potion combination spell— Divine Prairie Flames!”</p>
 <p>The endless flames instantly swallowed the rank 3 Magus, even spreading so far as to include the “Leylin” in the area of effect.</p>
 <p>”Leylin” who was surrounded by the many flames suddenly laughed hysterically, and morphed into many shadow chains that confined the rank 3 Magus in the flames.</p>
 <p>”Master Toram! Save me!” The rank 3 Magus’ face was full of dejection. He did all he could to seek help, and him looking to Toram for help was his last hope.</p>
 <p>But Leylin had blocked Toram’s path, and mercilessly dashed that last hope.</p>
 <p>”You must be the only high-ranked Magus left in the stronghold now?” Leylin looked to Toram after the rank 3 Magus’ life aura had completely dissipated in the sea of fire.</p>
 <p>”If you don’t use your remaining time to make me happy during our battle, I’m afraid I’ll continue to hunt down and kill all the other Magi below!”</p>
 <p>”That female Magus must be your apprentice? The two of you might even be related by blood. Don’t even think about lying to me. Both the bloodline ripples on your bodies and the spiritual force frequency have revealed your relationship…” Leylin shot a glance at one of the corpses lying around, and what he said caused Toram’s facial expression to change.</p>
 <p>Just when Leylin’s gaze shot across the area, the female Magus with a childlike face who had been lying behind the remains felt as if she was stared at by a fierce ancient creature. Her limbs began to shake uncontrollably.</p>
 <p>”It’s… It’s too terrifying!” Upon realising that she had been discovered, the female Magus tried to escape.</p>
 <p>A light green wind dissipated from her body and carried her to the depths of Doray Forest.</p>
 <p>”Other than Nina, even Master Borgin has….” As she started to sprint, tears streamed down her face.</p>
 <p>At the instant when Leylin had released his deadly attack, the low-ranked Magi were all exterminated. Other than the three rank 3 Magi, almost everyone else had instantly perished.</p>
 <p>No antidotes or defensive runes had any effect on the attack. Before the terrifying toxins of the Giant Kemoyin Serpent, everyone else was feeble and weak.</p>
 <p>Toram’s innate defensive spells had not in the least bit affected Leylin’s attack. If not for the protective charm she’d obtained from her mentor, she would have perished as well.</p>
 <p>The female Magus that was lucky enough to survive had hidden herself behind a wall, witnessing Leylin’s cruelty and terror. The two powerful rank 3 Magi had perished at his hands one by one, and from the looks of it, Leylin had not even unleashed his full power. Now, he was even using her life to threaten her mentor!</p>
 <p>After hearing her mentor’s hurried whisper, the female Magus could not take it anymore, and started sobbing out loud.</p>
 <p>Even so, the energy particles below her feet had not once stopped shining, as if escaping from that area was instinctive.</p>
 <p>In the depths of her subconscious, she did not want to return to face the horrifying monster anymore.</p>
 <p>”That’s not too bad of a suggestion! Looks like you care for her a lot!” Leylin watched as the rank 1 Magus escaped, with no intentions of giving chase.</p>
 <p>On the contrary, he turned to Toram who was ahead of him, and a taunting expression flashed across his face. “However, I’m afraid you’ll have to try to buy time. If not, she won’t be able to make much headway…”</p>
 <p>”Lunatic! Monster!” Toram cursed. A majority of Warlocks had anger management issues, something that was only exacerbated by battle.</p>
 <p>Compared to Magi, Warlocks prefered to ruin their opponents or even vent their desires upon them.</p>
 <p>Toram had previously witnessed similar scenarios. It was painful to see dead Magi, and many female Magi subjected to horrible violations.</p>
 <p>And now, she thought of Leylin in the same light as those crazy Warlocks.</p>
 <p>”Even if I have to put everything on the line, I will stop you at all costs!” Toram announced as she ripped the silver necklace off her neck with eyes full of determination.</p>
 <p>”Haha! Excellent! That’s the mindset!” At that instant, Leylin felt like the big villain from the movies of his previous life.</p>
 <p>”Seal of Dark Corrosion! Release!” Toram performed some gestures and, in that instant, the silver necklace exploded.</p>
 <p>In a flash, the energy waves on her body strengthened significantly. Drops of blood even started seeping out of her pores.</p>
 <p>The detailed black runes instantly crawled all over her body. Coupled with the scar on her face, she looked even more terrifying.</p>
 <p>Leylin could sense that she’d already reached the peak of the Hydro Phase. In fact, some of her spiritual force had already formed traces of crystals from repeated attempts at compression.</p>
 <p>Once completely solidified, Toram would reach the Crystal Phase.</p>
 <p>Of course, her rash actions put her in grave danger. However, right before her body completely fell apart, she’d stepped one foot into the Crystal Phase realm!</p>
 <p>This was definitely her trump card, some sort of mysterious spell that would put everything at stake.</p>
 <p>Strangely, Leylin did not try to stop Toram’s actions, instead allowing the aura on her body to rise slowly as he let out a hearty laugh, ”Haha… Good! Indeed, with this sort of mysterious spell, you won’t disappoint me!”</p>
 <p>From the very beginning, the entire reason why Leylin had adopted such abusive methods was to force Toram to use a spell that would exhaust her vitality and allow her to temporarily increase her strength.</p>
 <p>Although he’d accepted it as a task from the organisation, he also intended to experiment with his newly developed rank 3 spell— Fatality’s Tip.</p>
 <p>Even though its ability to break through the defensive spell formation spoke volumes of its formidability, he ultimately lacked the physical data to affirm its full capability. Especially with regards to its ability to clash with Crystal Phase Magi, something that engendered his resentment.</p>
 <p>He had discovered that with his strength, he was the best of the best among Hydro Phase Magi, and even a peak Hydro Phase Magus like Toram could do nothing to him. Only a Crystal Phase opponent would cause him trouble.</p>
 <p>And the A.I. Chip lacked data specifically regarding Crystal Phase Magi. Given the fact that Leylin would have to deal with Magi of that rank, he desperately needed a standard to measure his own capabilities.</p>
 <p>And now, Toram had become such a standard.</p>
 <p>When he’d probed her during the previous battle, the A.I. Chip had detected that not only had her strength become feeble, she had even seemed to be injured, something that resulted in her not performing to her fullest potential.</p>
 <p>And so Leylin took such drastic measures to compel his opponent, to incite her her will to live on so as to battle him.</p>
 <p>And from the looks of it, he’d achieved his goal.</p>
 <p>Originally a peak Hydro Phase Magus, Toram indeed possessed the formidable ability to partially crystallise her spiritual force using this mysterious spell, even if she’d pay for it with her life.</p>
 <p>It was rare to experience a fight against a Crystal Phase Magus. After all, the Crystal Phase Magi he’d previously come across were mostly his seniors, and he could not fight them.</p>
 <p>Magi like Toram, who had a probability of losing control when they forcefully entered the Crystal Phase, were even more scarce.</p>
 <p>Leylin immediately ordered: “A.I Chip, record this battle in detail!”</p>
 <p>[Orders received! Scan scheduled!] The A.I Chip intoned.</p>
 <p>A pale blue screen was projected ahead of Leylin’s eyes, and Toram who was in the screen was engulfed by strong radiation.</p>
 <p>The mysteries of Crystal Phase spiritual force were also slowly being uncovered by the A.I. Chip and presented to Leylin.</p>
 <p>”The madmen of the Ouroboros Clan should not even exist in this world!” Having advanced to the Crystal Phase, Toram’s strength now was a far cry from what it was before.</p>
 <p>Just the suppression of the aura in the atmosphere caused Leylin to feel discomfort.</p>
