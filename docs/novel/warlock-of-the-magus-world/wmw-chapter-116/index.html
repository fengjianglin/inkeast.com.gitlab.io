 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Taking Action</strong></span></p>
 <p>“Indeed! The inheritance of an official Magus is a sufficient reason for this fellowship to be broken!”</p>
 <p>Jayden spoke slowly.</p>
 <p>“Not only that!” Now, the metal liquid covered Bosain’s body and turned into a silver white armour.</p>
 <p>“If it was just a spell model, Grine Water or something of that sort, I wouldn't mind at all. But this is Norco Curadu Sfar’s legacy!”</p>
 <p>Bosain’s face became flushed.</p>
 <p>“We are talking about the great Magus Serholm! The inheritance of a rank 4 Morning Star Magus!”</p>
 <p>“The great Magus Serholm?!” Clarity appeared on Jayden’s face. Of course, he had heard of the legend of this great Magus.</p>
 <p>However, in the legends, the great Magus Serholm used an alternative title. Apart from Leylin who had an overpowered way to store data and Bosain who had a solid family foundation, there were many who weren't aware of this fact.</p>
 <p>“Since you know the reason, you can die in peace!”</p>
 <p>Bosain did not conceal the killing intent on his face as he viciously slashed the silver white sword down upon Jayden.</p>
 <p>*Hua!* The longsword split into countless small silver needles that were sent flying towards Jayden.</p>
 <p>”Form a shield!” Jayden shouted. More vines appeared from the badge and took the form of a large shield, in front of Jayden.</p>
 <p>*Ding Ding Dang Dang!* Countless needles fell like rain onto his shield, creating many small holes.</p>
 <p>The huge impact sent Jayden staggering backwards. His face became filled with despair.</p>
 <p>“Jayden! I know all of your tricks. Apart from your magic artifact what other trump cards do you have?”</p>
 <p>Bosain spoke these words to try and shatter Jayden’s confidence.</p>
 <p>Jayden retreated until his back hit a wall, then he turned his head and shouted to Leylin. “Leylin! Let's act together! If not we will both die!”</p>
 <p>“Leylin! Don't believe him! If you can stay neutral and be on the sidelines, or even help me, I swear that you will obtain the friendship of the Lilytell family!”</p>
 <p>After listening to the persuasion of both sides, Leylin appeared panic-stricken; he staggered back two steps and spoke in a quivering voice. “No! I don't want any inheritance anymore, just let me go….”</p>
 <p>After hearing those words, Jayden’s face looked even more aghast and anxious. Even his vine shield had become smaller in size.</p>
 <p>Bosain, on the other hand, laughed loudly. “Haha… My Lilytell family will definitely welcome a Potions Master like Leylin…”</p>
 <p>“As for you Jayden! You're finished!”</p>
 <p>The longsword in Bosain’s hands split again and each droplet of liquid metal floated in the air, turning into dart-like objects.</p>
 <p>“With my blood....”</p>
 <p>After seeing the opponent’s attack, hopelessness surfaced on Jayden’s face. He used the same method as before and smeared his blood on the green badge.</p>
 <p>In an instant, the green vine shield turned into a red giant one.</p>
 <p>“The energy in your badge should deplete soon huh? Even if you use your blood as a substitute how long can you last?!”</p>
 <p>Bosain shouted and sent countless needles flying towards Jayden.</p>
 <p>*Bang!*</p>
 <p>The red shield exploded and the innumerable needles pierced Jayden’s body.</p>
 <p>With countless holes present all over his body, Jayden was immediately dyed red. Regret and disbelief filled his face as he fell slowly to the ground.</p>
 <p>“Hu hu…” Bosain was panting somewhat loudly at this moment. He turned around and faced Leylin.</p>
 <p>“Well done! You did not attack me with him earlier!” With a sinister smile, Bosain pointed at Jayden who laid within a pool of blood.</p>
 <p>“I, the heir to the Lilytell family, the pride of Abyssal Bone Forest Academy, the silver white swordsman Bosain will grant you your preferred choice of death!”</p>
 <p>As he spoke, a commiserating yet toying expression appeared on his face; he was like a lion or tiger who was playing with a rabbit.</p>
 <p>“Choice… Way to die....” Leylin squeezed out a smile, “Mister Bosain, I don't quite understand you!”</p>
 <p>“My meaning is extremely clear, you can only die here!” Bosain’s expression was cold, “The inheritance of the great Magus Serholm is too important. I cannot allow the possibility of you leaking any information!”</p>
 <p>“Originally, as a genius in Potioneering, you had a bright future. What a pity…” Bosain looked at Leylin regretfully, as if feeling sorry for his plight.</p>
 <p>“Perhaps, you would like to end your own life … It might reduce some of the pain…”</p>
 <p>Bosain edged closer and closer to Leylin, his voice gentle yet enticing.</p>
 <p>There seemed to be a magical force in his voice, luring Leylin to do things the way he said.</p>
 <p>Leylin’s eyes went blank, his lips unconsciously formed the following, “I want to…”</p>
 <p>“It's going to be a success!” exclaimed Bosain, gleefully.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Leylin raised his head and grinned, revealing a pair of bright and shiny teeth, he said, “I want you dead!”</p>
 <p>*Bang!*</p>
 <p>A silver streak flew from Leylin’s hand onto Bosain’s face.</p>
 <p>Shock filled Bosain’s face, but a layer of liquid metal automatically formed a mask, protecting his face.</p>
 <p>*Ka-Cha!* The silver light skid against the mask, emitting sparks.</p>
 <p>“A pity that it’s a magic artifact with instantaneous defensive capabilities!”</p>
 <p>Leylin looked at Bosain who was retreating, his face showed a hint of regret and disappointment.</p>
 <p>“You… You were pretending earlier!” Bosain touched his face which had already swollen, and his expression began to contort.</p>
 <p>“Such a boring illusory spell! I was not afraid of it when I was a level 2 acolyte!”</p>
 <p>Leylin smiled brightly, “This look suits you very well! Like a pig head!”</p>
 <p>“You’re seeking death!”</p>
 <p>Bosain’s face was flushed from anger; the liquid metal crept and covered his whole body, forming a silver armour.</p>
 <p>His eyes were a little bloodshot as he brandished his longsword and charged towards Leylin.</p>
 <p>“I want to pluck each and every tendon from your body, you useless trash who only knows Potioneering!”</p>
 <p>“Oh really?”</p>
 <p>Leylin frowned. A black longbow appeared in his hands and a frost arrow was shot.</p>
 <p>*Sssii!* Bosain did not dodge nor hide, letting the arrow land on his body.</p>
 <p>The frost arrow was blocked by the silver armour and turned into a white mist that covered the surface of Bosain’s armour.</p>
 <p>Suffering from its effect, Bosain’s speed had lowered somewhat.</p>
 <p>“I have been watching you all along — all the potions in your bag should have been fully used up, am I right?” Bosain smiled maliciously, directly rushing at Leylin.</p>
 <p>“An accurate guess!”</p>
 <p>Leylin’s smile did not waver, which suddenly made Bosain feel a bad premonition.</p>
 <p>“It is unfortunate, but my trump card is not related to potions!”</p>
 <p>“Fallen Star Pendant! Activate!”</p>
 <p>Along with Leylin’s command, a layer of silver-grey light radiated from his body.</p>
 <p>This layer seemed like starlight, dim but sturdy and unwavering. It covered Leylin’s body forming a silver-grey armour all over him. On the surface of this armour, a few gems were flickering.</p>
 <p>*Bang!*</p>
 <p>Bosain struck with his longsword, but he was blocked directly and grabbed by Leylin’s right hand, which was covered by the armour. Following which, Leylin viciously punched Bosain’s face!</p>
 <p>*Ka-Cha!*</p>
 <p>The mask on Bosain’s face dented inwards and he immediately spat out several teeth as he flew backwards with a look of disbelief on his face.</p>
 <p>“As expected using fists to hit someone feels the best!”</p>
 <p>Leylin narrows his eyes and spoke with some satisfaction.</p>
 <p>*Hua La La!* Bosain crashed into a few empty bookshelves and they toppled over him. Numerous decomposing wooden boards buried Bosain within the rubble.</p>
 <p>*Bang!* The wooden boards were blasted away. Once again Bosain stood before Leylin with his bright silver armour.</p>
 <p>“I have underestimated you! A defensive type magic artifact! You are actually the one amongst us with the most secrets!”</p>
 <p>Bosain’s face now was extremely solemn. However, with two swollen lumps on both sides of his face, Leylin felt like laughing when he saw him.</p>
 <p>“Too much nonsensical stuff has been said!”</p>
 <p>Leylin’s muscles bulged and he clashed with Bosain.</p>
 <p>*Bang!* *Bang!* *Bang!*</p>
 <p>Booming noises sounded from the study room, sending dust flying everywhere. Through the barely visible dust screen, two humanoid creatures wearing armour could be seen charging at each other.</p>
 <p>These two creatures seemed not to be afraid of injuries. They only used the most brutal and barbaric fighting style — completely forsaking their defence, each one simply attacked his opponent.</p>
 <p>Bookshelves collapsed continuously and chaos ensued.</p>
 <p>If not for the two creatures deliberately avoiding the middle study-table containing the remnants, it, too, would have shared the fate of those bookshelves.</p>
 <p>With the seconds turning into minutes, it could be seen that the human figure — the one with the bright silver armour — seemed to be at a disadvantage. The white light on it, too, had somewhat dimmed.</p>
 <p>Finally, with a punch from the person armoured a silver-grey, the bright silver armour broke, turning back into its liquid metal form, and then it was restored to its original ball-shaped form.</p>
 <p>Leylin once again stomped on Bosain who was on the floor.</p>
 <p>*Crack!*, the sound of breaking bones could be heard from Bosain’s chest.</p>
 <p>After which, a shoe coated in silver-grey light nonchalantly stepped on his chest.</p>
 <p>One corner of Bosain’s lips was overflowing with blood, “I regret this! If only my scroll was still here, if only I didn’t use ‘silver light’ so many times earlier!”</p>
 <p>*Ka-Cha!*</p>
 <p>Leylin’s eyes were devoid of emotion. He showed no quarter towards Bosain and withdrew a dagger from his robes and severed all 4 of Bosain’s limbs.</p>
 <p>“Arghh….”</p>
 <p>Bosain’s facial muscles contorted, and cries of anguish reverberated in the whole study room.</p>
 <p>Leylin kicked the severed limbs away and took out a hemostasis potion, after which he took out a hemostasis potion and poured it on Bosain’s wound — he wasn’t going to let Bosain bleed to death.</p>
 <p>“You...Just kill me!” Bosain’s face was extremely pale as he forced the words out from his mouth.</p>
 <p>“How could I have the audacity to kill a member of the mighty Lilytell family?”</p>
 <p>Leylin smiled slightly, yet to Bosain, it seemed to be a very sinister and sadistic smile.</p>
 <p>“As the heir of a Magus family, you would definitely have some tracking spell cast on you by an official Magus. It is very likely that once I killed you, that official Magus would be able to sense it!”</p>
 <p>Leylin spoke slowly. At the same time, Bosain’s expression turned completely ashen.</p>
