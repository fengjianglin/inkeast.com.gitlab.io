 <p>[Beep! Database has been refreshed. Update completed.] After Leylin had flipped through about half of the book in his hands, the A.I. Chip which had gone silent for a while suddenly sounded out.</p>
 <p>“Good! Let’s see if there are any differences in the upgraded A.I. Chip!” His attention immediately wandered from the book, and he focused on his A.I. Chip.</p>
 <p>[Beep! Database on soul force is complete. Beginning collection of host’s data, recalculating.] The first prompt that the A.I. Chip gave had Leylin elated.</p>
 <p>“So soul force has finally been enumerated...” He had been at a loss due to the A.I. Chip’s inability to enumerate soul force for a very long time. All this while, he had collected a lot of information on the soul, and performed many experiments and thought of numerous conjectures. However, all that had not been able to complete the database on the soul.</p>
 <p>Now, the A.I. Chip had completely deduced this information.</p>
 <p>“Show me my current stats!” Leylin immediately commanded.</p>
 <p>[Leylin Farlier. Rank 4 Warlock. Bloodline: Giant Kemoyin Serpent (complete form). Strength: 50, Agility: 45, Vitality: 74.9, Spiritual Force: 956.8, Magic Power: 956 (magic power is in synchronisation with spiritual force). Soul force: 96 (Five Star)]</p>
 <p>The A.I. Chip intoned.</p>
 <p>“96 soul force? What does ‘five star’ mean?” Leylin asked.</p>
 <p>Soon after, a passage of information was shown by the A.I. Chip, [The star rating is a method that the Sky City has come up with to evaluate Morning Stars, based on organisms in the astral plane. Newly-advanced Morning Stars are at one star, while the peak is at five stars…]</p>
 <p>“I see. What beings are used as the standard?” Leylin wasn’t that interested in this star system. Instead, he was rather tempted to perform research on the organisms that had been set to be the standards for Morning Star Magi.</p>
 <p>[The organisms that have been set as the standard are the beings of the astral plane— the Heavenly Astral Race! At birth, they possess strength at the Morning Star realm, and it’s unknown how powerful they can become. The race was wiped out during ancient times. The Magi of Sky City obtained some of the data from ancient times, which is how it became the standard when it came to evaluating strength!]</p>
 <p>“Heavenly Astral Race? Beings from the astral plane? Morning Stars at birth?!”</p>
 <p>This piece of information had Leylin completely stunned. Never did he expect there to be dwellers in a place like the astral plane, and they were even so powerful that they had Morning Star strength right from birth.</p>
 <p>If compared to the Heavenly Astral Race, Giant Kemoyin Serpents could only cry. Their end point was this race’s beginning! There was no way to begin to compare them since they weren’t even on the same level.</p>
 <p>“Even such gifted creatures went extinct. Looks like the events during the ancient times were unfathomable…” Leylin sighed deeply.</p>
 <p>[Acquired information on a standard individual of the Heavenly Astral Race. Change standards?]</p>
 <p>Leylin’s current system of measurement used the standards from his previous world, which was why the numbers in each attribute seemed to be so phenomenally high, especially since they were calculated with regular humans in mind. If he used the standard criteria of the Heavenly Astral Race, his stats would immediately drop sharply.</p>
 <p>Compared to before, with the standard strength of a regular person at 1, this was now compared with the terrifying strength of a Heavenly Astral Race at 1. There would obviously be a marked difference in quantity.</p>
 <p>‘Changing the measurement units? Let’s try!’ Leylin touched his chin. “Display it!”</p>
 <p>[Beep!] A blue light flashed, and the numbers immediately changed before Leylin.</p>
 <p>[Leylin Farlier. Rank 4 Warlock. Bloodline: Giant Kemoyin Serpent (complete form). Strength: 1.5, Agility: 1.2, Vitality: 2.7, Spiritual force: 4.3 Soul force: 4.3 (Five Star)]</p>
 <p>Seeing the numbers that had decreased drastically, Leylin was rendered speechless.</p>
 <p>‘In other words, my strength and agility are only slightly higher than a Heavenly Astral Race at Morning Star. My vitality is twice that of theirs, while my spiritual and soul force are more than four times greater. All in all, I can take on two or three of them at once?’</p>
 <p>This comparison had stunned Leylin. He was now considered to be at the apex amongst Morning Stars in the central continent. He could even rival a Radiant Moon, and yet he was only slightly stronger than a child of the Heavenly Astral Race?</p>
 <p>This was quite a blow to his ego.</p>
 <p>“Forget it! Show the numbers according to the units from before. At the very least, the smaller the base numbers, the higher the precision!” Leylin stroked his chin, ‘When the numbers in all aspects increase by a large amount, I’ll then begin using the units of the Heavenly Astral Race. That’s better!’</p>
 <p>With a flicker from the A.I. Chip, all his data reverted to the original.</p>
 <p>[Display host’s soul diagram?]</p>
 <p>At this moment, the A.I. Chip showed another prompt.</p>
 <p>“Of course!” Leylin did not hesitate at all. After the soul force database was completed, his grasp on soul force was even greater, and he could do things that would have been very difficult before.</p>
 <p>One of these included the structural diagram of his soul.</p>
 <p>*Bzz!* A diagram that had been magnified countless times was projected in front of Leylin’s eyes.</p>
 <p>His soul, which was also the truesoul of a Morning Star, was protected within the point mass. The point mass’ terrifying density and strength was the last defensive layer protecting a Morning Star’s truesoul.</p>
 <p>There were few Magi who could clearly observe their own truesouls within their point mass, and make appropriate changes to train the soul. In fact, there were practically none.</p>
 <p>With the help of the A.I. Chip, he could finally pass through this barrier.</p>
 <p>In the diagram, Leylin’s truesoul was like a tiny star, emanating bright rays of light, with a tinge of crimson within. It was as if a crimson Giant Kemoyin Serpent was cruising inside the thing.</p>
 <p>[Beep! Host’s soul composition is loose and not dense enough. Suggestion…] Through the diagram and the A.I. Chip’s analysis, Leylin’s issues when training the soul were made apparent, and the A.I. Chip gave concrete suggestions.</p>
 <p>If other Morning Star Magi were to know of this, they’d want to commit suicide out of envy.</p>
 <p>When had the mysteries of the soul ever been displayed before Magi?</p>
 <p>‘It was probably because of the hasty infusion of Fireplume.’ Leylin stroked his chin, ‘Luckily, I can still salvage the situation through the improved meditation technique.’</p>
 <p>Every three ranks in training as a Magus was a major hurdle. The first to third focused on training spiritual force, and the fourth to sixth on the soul. If problems with the soul were not resolved now, there would be huge issues during his future advancements.</p>
 <p>However, this was not the end of the surprises that the A.I. Chip had to offer.</p>
 <p>[Beep! To generate a conjecture of Radiant Moon soul and compare it to a diagram?] The A.I. Chip asked robotically,</p>
 <p>“Yes!” Leylin obviously chose that option.</p>
 <p>Afterwards, beside his soul diagram, a few other similar ones appeared, marking out the initial, middle, and late stages of Radiant Moon.</p>
 <p>In the diagram, the difference between Morning Stars and Radiant Moons was made obvious. The soul of a Morning Star was similar to a star, dazzling and condensed, but a Radiant Moon who had just advanced had a soul that was tens of times larger than that of a Morning Star, forming a large and full sphere.</p>
 <p>In other words, it resembled the moon.</p>
 <p>As for the Radiant Moon stages, those who had just advanced had souls which only emanated bright rays from a small portion of its full area. The rest of the moon was dim, forming a crescent. It was like a new moon being blocked by the sun.</p>
 <p>Magi at the middle stage of Radiant Moon had half their soul emanating clear rays, like a half moon. Peak Radiant Moon Magi had light that was dazzling and transparent, like a full moon.</p>
 <p>“Name these stages New Moon, Half Moon and Full Moon!” Leylin did not hesitate to label these Radiant Moon stages.</p>
 <p>Of course, his soul was now merely a star and was a large distance away from reaching Radiant Moon.</p>
 <p>‘There were mistakes in my previous conjectures. Zegna was probably merely a New Moon, while Scarlet Eye was at most a Half Moon. He had yet to achieve the peak, Full Moon!’</p>
 <p>Leylin’s eyes suddenly flashed with understanding. He had not obtained the twelfth and thirteenth levels of Fireplume, so it was plausible that the fourteenth level could still be at the Radiant Moon realm, and was representative of the soul reaching Full Moon.</p>
 <p>‘In that case, the road from rank 4 to rank 5 has completely unravelled in front of me!’ Leylin looked ecstatic. The third and fourth ranks had a very large disparity between them, with spiritual force upgrading to soul force. There was another huge gap between rank six and seven, with soul force upgrading to the manifestation and wielding of Laws. Hence, all these gaps were immense and usually caused tremendous changes.</p>
 <p>Advancing from rank 3 to 6, one’s training was mostly on the soul, because it was the level of one’s soul that signified one’s strength.</p>
 <p>“First is Morning Star, where the soul becomes a tiny star, with power from one star up to five. Next are the New Moon, Half Moon and Full Moon phases at the Radiant Moon realm!”</p>
 <p>The path through Morning Star and Radiant Moon were completely presented before Leylin.</p>
 <p>‘That’s basically it. Of course, there might be some odd geniuses at the apex who break through these boundaries, but in general, that’s how this is divided.</p>
 <p>‘This upgrade was definitely worth it! Even just the completion of the soul force database alone would have been enough, not to mention the rest.’</p>
 <p>An expression of elation rose on Leylin’s face as he could not hold himself back and burst into laughter.</p>
 <p>“My Lord!” At this moment, Yuro’s voice travelled over. It was very low, and she was obviously afraid of disturbing the other scholars.</p>
 <p>“Mm?” Leylin turned back and saw Boffel behind her.</p>
 <p>“Haha! So Your Grace has been staying in the library all this while. Such a thirst for knowledge is definitely admirable, but the Sage Appraisal is about to begin. Besides, the Monarch of Skies would like to meet Your Grace...”</p>
 <p>Boffel had on an amiable smile, while the female Magus beside him looked rather flabbergasted.</p>
