 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong> Elite Group of Magi </strong></span></p>
 <p>“Yes! I’ve considered it thoroughly, I cannot sit back and watch my clan die in war!” Ivanov insisted, with an unexpectedly sanctified look on his face.</p>
 <p>“Very well! Our targeted enemies are only those evil bloodline warlocks. You guys, who have awakened in time, are still a part of us Magi!” A voice echoed from the imprint.</p>
 <p>“There’s no doubt about that! I’m honoured!” Ivanov said excitedly.</p>
 <p>Immediately, he asked again with worry, “Is this communication channel safe? The headquarters of the Ouroboros Clan has very strict isolation and tapping capabilities!”</p>
 <p>“Haha… Rest assured! This has already been encrypted personally! Our conversation will definitely not be leaked out!”</p>
 <p>“Alright then, what do you need me to do?” Since he had already decided to betray, Ivanov was pretty much nonchalant.</p>
 <p>“Very simple, you only need to…” The voice softened over time, while Ivanov nodded repeatedly.</p>
 <p>The dim light slowly extinguished as darkness engulfed the entire place.</p>
 <p>…..</p>
 <p>It was only a matter of time before the attacks began.</p>
 <p>By the time the Warlocks, who had gotten used to the martial law, discovered that the entire city had been surrounded by a patch of carnivorous plants, many of them felt a sort of relief.</p>
 <p>Contrary to the previous uneasiness and tension, these visible enemies made them feel more secure. What followed next would be a great war— the winner would survive, and the loser would be doomed for all eternity. It was as simple as that.</p>
 <p>Compared to open war, the oppressed feeling of the wait from before was what caused mental breakdowns.</p>
 <p>But many Warlocks only felt relieved for a moment. By the time they saw the legion of airships all over the sky pressing in like dark clouds, even Faisal had a slight feeling that it was as if his previous efforts to fight for power had become a joke!</p>
 <p>“Alert!” He shouted at the top of his voice, a slight tremble to his tone.</p>
 <p>“Magus Tower authorisation complete! Constructing core defence system!” Contrary to him, those Warlocks with specific orders could still carry out their tasks orderly.</p>
 <p>*Buzz!* A Magus Tower began to shake, and many runes emerged from the surface of the tower as they shot up into the sky.</p>
 <p>All the towers in the city were in the same situation. The many runes, constructed of strings of light, converged at the heart of the city, taking the form of a bright sun.</p>
 <p>A water screen surrounding the sun cascaded from all directions with a crystal clear glow on its surface, engulfing the entire city.</p>
 <p>“Such a terrifying spell formation, it should be employing at least 50 to 60 elemental reactors and pools!”</p>
 <p>In the centre of the enemy camp, a green-haired Magus sneered, “Pity, the other party was too impatient. We were only scaring him, yet he exposed his trump card!”</p>
 <p>“Yes!” Another female Magus dressed in red covered her lips and smiled charmingly, “If the Ouroboros Clan’s warlocks are all of such quality, victory will definitely be ours!”</p>
 <p>“In fact, as long as the other party’s three elders do not rush back, there will be no change to this war’s result. At most, it will be a matter of time!” the green-haired Magus corrected. As a high-ranking leader of the legion, the intelligence he possessed was far greater than that of ordinary Magi. He even knew about the disappearance of Gilbert and the others.</p>
 <p>“Hence, what we need to do now is to try attacking…” The female Magus bit her lips, seeming rather playful.</p>
 <p>In front of her, the male Magus appeared very confident, and he announced a little proudly, “There’s not even a need to test it. We can have the other organisations to help us with everything!”</p>
 <p>“You mean the Arm of Vengeance?” The female Magus nodded, giggling immediately and stretching her body in a relaxed manner, “Since we already have them helping us, should we take this opportunity to do other things…”</p>
 <p>Her voice was sweeter than the sweetest honey. The male Magus could not help but be intoxicated by it.</p>
 <p>Faintly, two other soft voices echoed over, “Those Magi, are they reliable?”</p>
 <p>“Just mere sacrifices. Anyway, when the time comes, they’ll be given up. What's there to worry?”</p>
 <p>“I’m still a little worried……”</p>
 <p>“At worst, I’ll hand over command to you. You just have to keep an eye on them for me…” In here, all sorts of conspiracies were gradually staged, yet they were completely hidden due to the many green plant legions.</p>
 <p>The things that happened here did not attract any attention from the outside world.</p>
 <p>Following the encirclement of the plants and airship armies, dark clouds of war immediately filled the region surrounding the Ouroboros Clan. The approaching storm made many of the Kemoyin Warlocks clasp their hands tightly. Just then, the candidate who was to serve as the main offensive walked down from the airship.</p>
 <p>The Magus had a pockmarked face and a prosthetic wooden leg. He walked with a limp, and his face burned with the desire for vengeance. He stared at the city of Warlocks, and if looks could kill his gaze alone would’ve burnt it down.</p>
 <p>“Ouroboros Clan! Kemoyin Warlocks! To think you’d face such a day too!” An ice-cold voice seemed to be forced out from the crevice between his teeth.</p>
 <p>“Sir Lober! According to the orders of the alliance, you will command the first wave of attacks!” said a masked figure from beside him as he slightly bowed down. Even with his expression hidden behind the mask, his tone was oozing with contempt.</p>
 <p>Robert clenched and relaxed his fists repeatedly several times, but still gritted his teeth and spoke, “I understand! Please inform the sirs that Robert will fulfil his mission!”</p>
 <p>“Very good!” The masked man made a swift bow before his body vanished into thin air.</p>
 <p>“Mentor! We’ve finally reached this point!” Another old man, his head full of grey hair, walked down from the airship as well. When he saw the already-surrounded city of warlocks, he could not control himself as tears streamed down his face.</p>
 <p>The Magi who descended from the airship were mostly those who had a deep-seated hatred for the Ouroboros Clan.</p>
 <p>Due to their vengeful desires, as well as the possible benefits, they did not hesitate to take up the role of the coalition’s vanguard. They even embarked on the bloody path of revenge in their own territories, cleaning it up in revenge for all the humiliation and hardships that their ancestors had been through.</p>
 <p>And Robert, the chief of the Arm of Vengeance, was the leader elected by the many small groups.</p>
 <p>On the other side, many Warlocks were observing the enemy from on top of a great tower. The only difference was, while the other side was quite free and leisurely, even able to pursue the pleasures of life, their situation was much more difficult.</p>
 <p>Their expressions, Faisal’s included, were dark and filled with fear.</p>
 <p>“Azure Mountain City’s Azure Rain Knights! And the Demon Magus Army from the Nefas!” Freya’s hands gripped the railing as she watched the other two armies who had distinct insignias. Her eyes were full of disbelief.</p>
 <p>In the direction she was looking, a formation of knights that were armoured in blue with a bunch of giant feathers on their heads were standing quietly. So were a strange-looking group of Magi who possessed scaly bodies as well as claws and horns.</p>
 <p>The mere energy waves unconsciously emitted from their bodies was enough to suffocate a rank 1 Magus. Even the allied army did not dare to stay too close, and kept their distance.</p>
 <p>“The Demon Hunter and the Azure Mountain King have shed all pretence of cordiality; they actually sent their elite subordinates out to attack…” Compared to the other forces who were secretive, the Azure Mountain City’s and Nefas’ forces evidently did not have as many considerations.</p>
 <p>This explained the other party’s vengeance and hate towards the Ouroboros Clan. It was to the extent that they were already confident that the three elders would not return, so they would give no quarter.</p>
 <p>“The Azure Rain Knights are still alright, they are only counterfeits of the ancient Steel Knights, but these demon Magi…”</p>
 <p>On the other side, Lucian also frowned, “They are all Magi who have communicated with the demon plane. Their bodies have been altered by demonic power, allowing them to possess a very special power. They even resorted to signing contracts with the demons to awaken all kinds of strange abilities! And only the Demon Hunter can completely subdue them and keep them for his own use. Often, their appearance represents destruction and death…”</p>
 <p>“This was all caused by your Mentor,” Faisal sneered. “Moreover, even at this point in time, your brother Leylin still hasn't appeared!”</p>
 <p>Because Gilbert had forcibly snatched away many portions of the Forgotten Land’s resources from Cyril, the relationship between the two was never good. Faisal did not agree with the way Gilbert did things, hence he naturally had to use that as a pretext to make a fuss.</p>
 <p>In fact, if he knew that the Azure Mountain King’s exasperation was caused by Leylin, he would probably go even crazier.</p>
 <p>“What we decided originally, is the Elder Association’s decision. Furthermore, the three elders did this together, don't say that you didn't use those bloodline treasures at all!” Freya immediately rebutted.</p>
 <p>Seeing her speak up for him, Lucian could not help but direct a kind smile to Freya.</p>
 <p>“Ahem…” Upon noticing that the situation was descending into a cold war, another old man whose face had mottled snake scales immediately came over to mediate the dispute.</p>
 <p>“Leylin and Schadt both have to deduce Mentor and the others’ coordinates. Now is the most crucial moment; it's normal that they’re not here. We need to work together to overcome our difficulties right now”</p>
 <p>Not only did this aged warlock possess Crystal Phase strength, he was also of a relatively high rank. Even Faisal could only display anger on his face, shutting his mouth after.</p>
 <p>By this time, they had also noticed the other party’s movements.</p>
 <p>Many small Magus organisations swaggered to the city’s borders under another Magus’ lead. They then began to set up a spell formation.</p>
 <p>“Robert?! This bastard! He actually dared to come out!” A feminine Warlock licked the blade of the knife in his hand and said, “I should've given him a few more slashes that time!”</p>
