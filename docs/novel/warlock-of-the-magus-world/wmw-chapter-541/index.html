 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong> Determination and Action </strong></span></p>
 <p>The spiritual flame of a Morning Star Magus had an intricate relationship with their body. Its strength also reflected the time the Magus had remaining.</p>
 <p>That Freya’s necklace had encountered such a situation meant the original body of Blood Duchess Emma had likely been dealt severe damage in the foreign world.</p>
 <p>Trauma would weaken a Magus’ vitality, which in turn caused such a change in the spiritual flame they left behind.</p>
 <p>“Mentor… Mentor!” Freya’s eyes turned red as she covered her mouth, but Leylin’s secret imprint twinkled before he could try to console her.</p>
 <p>“Yes, Faisal?” Leylin frowned as he tapped the secret imprint open.</p>
 <p>“Your Grace, my Mentor… the spiritual flame of the First Elder was extinguished a minute ago…” Faisal’s voice was husky. It was as if his heart had sunk, and he was feeling hopeless.</p>
 <p>“Extinguished?” Leylin touched his chin. If the spiritual flame had been extinguished, the Morning Star Warlock’s originally body must have perished.</p>
 <p>The only thing that supported the First Elder’s group was that he was still alive. There was still hope for them to return from the foreign world.</p>
 <p>And now, that final hope had been shattered. Faisal’s change was understandable.</p>
 <p>“But what happened? Wasn’t it all good until now?” Leylin felt puzzled, it seemed like a conspiracy was afoot.</p>
 <p>Another connection request came up before Leylin could end Faisal’s secret imprint call, and Kesha’s panicked voice sounded out.</p>
 <p>“Leylin! Leylin!” She called his name directly, forgetting about his current status. It showed how desperate she was.</p>
 <p>“What happened?” The ominous feeling in Leylin’s heart grew stronger.</p>
 <p>“... Forgive me, Your Grace!” Kesha paused to correct her misbehaviour before continuing, “It’s Mentor. The spiritual flame Duke Gilbert left behind has grown extremely unstable, and is flickering strongly. I… I’m very worried…”</p>
 <p>“I got it!” Leylin nodded, and his voice turned serious and solemn, “Pass down my orders, all Crystal Phase Warlocks are to report to the meeting room. We might be in trouble...”</p>
 <p>The Warlock elites were now congregated here instead of residing in their own territories. Since they were all in Phosphorescence Swamp, they could gather immediately after Leylin’s orders were passed.</p>
 <p>Leylin reckoned that these people would not have come so fast if it was not related to their teachers.</p>
 <p>“Duke Farlier!” The panic-stricken Warlocks calmed a little upon seeing Leylin dressed in his huge robe.</p>
 <p>“Please, sit down and be at ease!” Leylin sat at the head chair. With his battle experience, he had long since acquired a dignified aura that turned the meeting room solemn.</p>
 <p>“Thank you, Your Grace!” A number of Crystal Phase Magi bowed and settled down in order.</p>
 <p>By virtue of being his wife, Freya occupied the seat next to Leylin, a fact that left some of the rest in envy.</p>
 <p>Leylin sighed while looking at the handful of Crystal Phase Warlocks in an upright position. The last war had caused tremendous loss to the Ouroboros Clan, and the loss of their elite forces was especially tough to recover from.</p>
 <p>It would take at least a few hundred years for them to recover to peak condition.</p>
 <p>“Schadt, report!” Leylin said after glancing across everyone and called for Schadt only when everyone settled down.</p>
 <p>“Master!” Schadt wiped off the fog that was on his thick spectacles, bowing to Leylin immediately after he stood up. He spoke in a dignified manner, “The spiritual flames of the elders that we’d kept in our technical department started fluctuating vigorously 24 minutes ago, and the First Elder’s has completely died out. I’m afraid that…”</p>
 <p>Leylin too felt somewhat frustrated and aggrieved. After all, this was the fall of another Morning Star Warlock.</p>
 <p>Even though Schadt did not continue his words, Faisal and one of the Crystal Phase Warlocks had lowered their heads. Losing the First Elder was definitely a huge blow to their morale.</p>
 <p>“I’ve asked the other two Morning Star seeds as well. It’s not just a single spiritual flame that flickered, it’s all of them. The other two elders must be in the same plight as the First Elder in the foreign world…”</p>
 <p>There was not much to say for now. After Schadt sat down, the rest of the Warlocks placed their focus on Leylin.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing their reaction, Leylin cleared his throat, “Schadt, have the coordinates of the foreign world been confirmed?”</p>
 <p>“My apologies! The technical department and I have been working on this problem endlessly. There are two possible coordinates on our list, I will send them to you after this!”</p>
 <p>A tinge of shame surfaced on Schadt’s face. This incident was a humiliation to the entire technical department. They had been overconfident and bragged that they were going to solve the problem in a few days’ time, but took them nearly five years. It was such a dereliction of their duty.</p>
 <p>The Crystal Phase Warlock who had tears in the eyes just like Faisal slammed the table and shouted, “Schadt, you old fogey! Are you pulling strings and intentionally not revealing the coordinates of the foreign world?”</p>
 <p>The moment he heard these words, Schadt fumed with rage. “Nonsense! I vow in the name of everyone in the technical department, never have I orchestrated something like that!”</p>
 <p>Before, he’d suffered in silence because it had been difficult for him to locate the coordinates. Afterwards, there seemed to be another strange interference that added to the complexity, leaving him grasping at his hair.</p>
 <p>‘Could it be the interference of another organisation that is not eager to see our Dukes being saved?’ A thought surfaced in Schadt’s mind, but was quickly suppressed as it was too sinister a plot.</p>
 <p>However, Faisal remained silent. Hid reaction affirmed the Warlock’s suspicion, but before he could snarl at him, Faisal dragged his arm with force.</p>
 <p>“What the hell are you doing, Faisal!” The Crystal Phase Warlock growled.</p>
 <p>“Watch your manners, Marquis Ordofol!” Faisal’s voice was equally low, but it carried within an undeniable order.</p>
 <p>“I’m sorry, I acted out of line! Please forgive me, Marquis Schadt!” The Warlock’s face blushed, but he stilled apologised to Schadt and bowed to Leylin who was in the head seat, “Please forgive me, Your Grace!”</p>
 <p>“Never mind!” Leylin waved and stared at Faisal with intrigue until sweat glided down his cheeks.</p>
 <p>Leylin took a last look at the Warlocks before he spoke in a low voice, “I have come to a decision, I will set off tomorrow to rescue the Elders!”</p>
 <p>There was a minute of pause, which then quickly recovered as excitement and joy could be seen in everyone’s eyes.</p>
 <p>Still, they did not dare to show their emotions. They kept reminding Leylin not to fall for tricks.</p>
 <p>“My dear…” After all the Crystal Phase Warlocks had been dismissed, only Freya was left behind, her eyes filled with worry.</p>
 <p>Emma was her Mentor, but Leylin was her dearest husband. This situation was complicated, like a spider web that pulled her heart apart.</p>
 <p>At last, she asked, “This time round… is it going to be dangerous?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, there will be danger, but it’s a chance too! Trust me, I’ll bring your mentor back!” Leylin gave Freya a reassuring, heart-warming smile.</p>
 <p>Seeing Leylin with such confidence, Freya felt more at ease. However, she had missed the trace of complication in Leylin’s eyes.</p>
 <p>After returning to the Magus Tower, Leylin went straight to the astral gate and fell into deep thought.</p>
 <p>“This time... I’m afraid that I really have to make the trip!” Leylin was very clear on the fact that there were voices asking for his help being circulated in the Ouroboros Clan, and they had grown stronger now.</p>
 <p>He had suppressed these messages as long as he could. He had to do something now, otherwise the entire Ouroboros Clan might fall apart.</p>
 <p>Luckily, he had already gotten what he wanted during this period of time. Even if the other two Morning Star Warlocks returned, his power in the clan was unshakeable.</p>
 <p>Also, Leylin was not too worried about the trip as he had already formed a more complete strategy after getting to know the existence of the puppetmaster behind the scene.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Almost at the same time, high up on a throne that was made from eternal darkness and rumbling thunder.</p>
 <p>The rank 5 Magus that had a moon rune on his forehead was exchanging thoughts with someone through telepathy.</p>
 <p>“How are things going with the Ouroboros Clan?”</p>
 <p>“Everything has been prepared and we are ready to take action! As long the opponent enters the foreign world, we can block him completely from this world and wipe out the entire Ouroboros Clan!”</p>
 <p>“You disappointed me the last time. I do not wish to see it again!” The Radiant Moon Magus warned with great dignity.</p>
 <p>“There is no need to worry, Master!” The Morning Star conscient dispersed on its own, and the Radiant Moon Magus sat still in the throne, pondering.</p>
 <p>“Was it really that kiddo in the ruins of Scarlet Crescent? What an interesting pup!” A mysterious voice sounded in the air, but the Radiant Moon Magus did not seem surprised at all.</p>
 <p>“I wasn’t quite confident, but Siebel’s already dead; he’s the most suspicious!” Radiant Moon Magus spoke in a cold tone, “I have to get him!”</p>
 <p>“He’s just a Kemoyin Serpent Warlock, even if he had any trump cards, the bloodline shackles will be his Achilles heel!” the mysterious voice sounded in disdain.</p>
