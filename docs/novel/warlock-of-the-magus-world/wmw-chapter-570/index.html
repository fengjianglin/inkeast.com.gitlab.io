 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong> Chaotic Battle</strong></span></p>
 <p>“Number 1, order received!” “Number 2, order received!” “Number 3, order received!”</p>
 <p>Along with the old man’s command, three different voices sounded from the dark-green metal bracelet.</p>
 <p>“Begin extraction of aggrieved souls! Start the sacrifice…” The old man’s voice was calm, yet held within it a bone-piercing chilliness.</p>
 <p>At the same time, all the Star ranks in Tylasus City felt a chill in their hearts.</p>
 <p>“This feeling?”</p>
 <p>“A spell formation from the Magus World, an undead element spell formation aimed at aggrieved souls!” Leylin, Gilbert and Emma immediately recognised this unique energy.</p>
 <p>Seeing the flesh and blood flying everywhere in the square, Emma laughed bitterly, “Such an environment will do wonders for an undead spell formation!”</p>
 <p>Even if the Morning Stars restrained themselves, they would still cause major damage to the surroundings. On top of that, it was currently the Holy Solar Day, and those gathered here were not just the residents of Tylasus City. Tourists, followers from different regions, and many others had packed the city to the brim, and the square especially held a large crowd. Now, they had all been turned into minced meat.</p>
 <p>Even if they were high-ranking officials or nobles, many had died. Obviously, nobody would bother with the commoners.</p>
 <p>“I’m afraid the Magi of Jupiter’s Lightning have made their move!” Leylin tangled with a two-headed fire elemental hound as he transmitted to Gilbert and the others.</p>
 <p>In front of Leylin was a giant flaming hound about two stories high and with inverted steel spikes on its body. Its savage gaze settled on Leylin through its skull, similar to the Cerberus of the underworld in myths.</p>
 <p>This was also one of the members of the delegation, and the energy on its body had already reached the limits of rank 3. Hence, Leylin found ‘some trouble’ when dealing with it, and even needed to depend on support from other team members to somewhat handle it.</p>
 <p>Making use of the chaos in the square, Gilbert and Emma secretly came to Leylin’s side. The three Morning Stars made a team that might seem to have been formed by chance, and surrounded the double-headed flame hound.</p>
 <p>There were many temporary team-ups like this in the square already. Besides, at this point not many would pay attention to Leylin.</p>
 <p>Of course, Bowens was an exception.</p>
 <p>“Schiker, do you see that?” Despite the chaotic situation, Schiker was devoted to his duty and was guarding at the centre, with Bowens at his side.</p>
 <p>“There’s definitely something off about that Ley! One of the nobles near him is an Earl, and the other a Viscount. Both are people on the list for thorough investigation. Furthermore, Loke has pointed out that their existence itself is suspicious…”</p>
 <p>“Let me think about it! Let me think…” Schiker clutched at his forehead, feeling a headache coming on. At this moment, he was more concerned for his father. As for Ley? That was just a trivial matter. As long as his father was still around, there was nothing that could not be solved.</p>
 <p>Just when Schiker had made up his mind, the undead spell formation set-up by Jupiter’s Lightning was activated.</p>
 <p>“What’s that…”</p>
 <p>Dark green rays flashed out of the ground, forming a mysterious round symbol in the air. Phosphorescent green lights shone gloriously.</p>
 <p>“It’s the symbol of the Mobius Organisation. They’re here too!”</p>
 <p>Many loud cries sounded, and caused the square to descend even further into a state of chaos. This was especially so after many Emberwings found that the green ring of light was absorbing the energy in their bodies, and even their flesh and blood!</p>
 <p>Streams of black gas were emitted from the body of a noble. Before he could sense anything was wrong, he had already collapsed to the ground, a strange expression on his face as his body dried up.</p>
 <p>The weaker nobles all lost their lives instantly under the mysterious spell formation deployed by the Mobius Organisation. Even experts at the eighth level of Fireplume and above could feel the strength being sapped out of their bodies.</p>
 <p>“We can’t wait any longer!” A few Emberwings at the peak of level nine exchanged glances and charged into the air, blazing flames behind them forming the phantoms of large phoenixes.</p>
 <p>*Boom!* The flames and the dark green light collided, but that only resulted in a few of them being sent flying, spraying blood everywhere.</p>
 <p>“You guys can’t do it. I’ll take care of this!” Without waiting for these Emberwings to reach the ground, a pair of large powerful arms stopped them from flying. The streams of black gas being emitted from their bodies were burnt to nothingness by the flames.</p>
 <p>“The head of the garrison!” These few Emberwings recognised him. This was the head of the garrison of Tylasus City, and they immediately saluted him.</p>
 <p>“Mm!” He was a man of few words. He had a head of long, soft silver hair, his handsome face currently filled with annoyance.</p>
 <p>“The Mobius Organisation! Those little mice that only know to hide in the gutters and shadows… Looks like teaching them a lesson by destroying their headquarters wasn’t enough!” He snorted, and the force field of a powerful Star rank fighter exploded forth. He soared into the air, a red fiery streak shooting towards the distorted dark green circle of light.</p>
 <p>*Boom! Boom! Boom!*</p>
 <p>The streak of fire was obstructed midway, and multiple human figures appeared. A total of seven Magi dressed in black robes floated in mid-air, unique undulations from their point mass causing this Emberwing to have a huge change in expression.</p>
 <p>“So many Star ranks?!” Shock instantly filled his mind. According to his intel, the Mobius Organisation was quite small. Though their sacrifices were bloody and insane, they didn’t even have as many as the three patriarchs of the Triserpent Sect.</p>
 <p>Now, however, they had deployed seven Star ranks to fight him. How could it not be appalling?</p>
 <p>There were likely less than seven Star rank Emberwings in the entire capital! The addition of such a powerful force instantly reversed the situation.</p>
 <p>There was one more thing to consider. If the Mobius Organisation had been concealing their strength in the past, what were they planning now?</p>
 <p>There wasn’t any time left for him to ponder on these things, and ferocious energy was emitted as the seven Star ranks cast their spells.</p>
 <p>Their Morning Star domains appeared, overlapping with each other to form a starry sky. This caused the Star rank Emberwing to turn deathly pale. His body had been suppressed.</p>
 <p>“Using spells in other worlds is much too troublesome, but thankfully our organisation has prepared and analysed countless spell models. Though our Morning Star Arcane Arts don’t suit the rules of this world well, rank 4 spells are enough for now. Prepare the combination spell!” The Morning Star Magus standing in the middle spoke coldly.</p>
 <p>A ferocious tide of elemental particles surged towards his palm like a tsunami, forming a terrifying energy spheroid. More condensed into it, and it strengthened continuously.</p>
 <p>“Rank 4 spell— Binding Forcefield!” A female on the right pointed at the leader of the garrison.</p>
 <p>In that instant, the leader felt like he was stuck inside a rock. The air around him became incomparably heavy, and even just moving was becoming difficult</p>
 <p>“Rank 4 spell— Five Sense Severance!” Another Magus spoke up, their voice sounding strange. It was like a continuous shriek, piercing to the ear.</p>
 <p>“Rank 4 spell…”</p>
 <p>Rank 4 spell after rank 4 spell was cast by these Morning Star Magi, binding the Emberwing tightly and draining all his strength.</p>
 <p>The overlay of seven Morning Star domains had practically created an independent space. With the strength of their combination spell, they had even sealed off this region. It left the Emberwings outside with no choice but to watch on furiously, with no way to send help.</p>
 <p>“In the name of the flesh of Mobius, I bestow unto you your death…” As if chanting, the Morning Star Magus in the middle passed his judgement.</p>
 <p>*Boom!* The Emberwing’s silver hair drifted in the wind. This garrison head’s body now completely lacked any form of an aura, and even his soul had been destroyed, giving him no chance at revival.</p>
 <p>Though this was another world and executing spells was slightly troublesome, seven Morning Star Magi had joined hands and even used a combination of rank 4 spells. This strength did not lose out to some Morning Star Arcane Arts!</p>
 <p>Indeed, a Star rank had fallen with a single move. The Morning Star Magi from another world showed their sharp teeth in front of the other races once more.</p>
 <p>Even as the corpse of the garrison head fell to the ground, many Emberwings stood there in disbelief. Though there had been a large battle from earlier, this was the first time a Star rank had died!</p>
 <p>On top of that, this was the Holy Solar Festival, a celebration for all Emberwings. This was the first time a Star rank clansman had died at the celebration, and that was the ultimate ridicule!</p>
 <p>In that moment, the Emberwings felt like they were dreaming.</p>
 <p>“Haha, friends of the Mobius organisation, you’ve appeared just in time!” The fire elementals, who had been at a disadvantage, suddenly roared and quickly transformed into tremendous lava giants, beginning to wreak havoc in Tylasus City.</p>
 <p>With the addition of seven Morning Star Magi, the Emberwings were put at an immediate disadvantage. Though they won in terms of their numbers, they were at a disadvantage in terms of their Morning Star strength.</p>
 <p>In front of Morning Stars, tactics of victory with numbers were a joke, especially with these seven Magi of Jupiter’s Lightning specialising in water and ice elemental spells. This caused the many Emberwings who had never encountered such a situation to fall into trouble.</p>
 <p>With the retreat of military officials and high-ranking bodyguards, the entirety of Tylasus City collapsed into a mess of blood and fire.</p>
 <p>The whole city seemed to be crying and yelling. The flying flesh and blood broke off and burnt many of the banners that had been put up in celebration, mocking them.</p>
 <p>Seeing this scene, Schiker’s fingernails dug deeper into his flesh, and blood even began to flow. However, he was told by many bodyguards to retreat.</p>
 <p>‘Father, end the battle quickly and save your people!’ Schiker could not help but silently pray in his heart.</p>
