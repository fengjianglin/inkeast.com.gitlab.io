 <p>Much to his chagrin, Leylin had discovered that even though the Ouroboros Clan had a long heritage and was a large, powerful organisation, there were many traditions and complex regulations that were very tedious.</p>
 <p>Especially in terms of hierarchy; nobody knew whether it was inherited from the Giant Kemoyin Serpents, but their hierarchy was very rigid.</p>
 <p>Previously, even if they were all Giant Kemoyin Serpent Warlocks, Kesha who had reached the Vapour Phase would pay no attention to someone like Leylin. Yet, the moment he made the breakthrough himself, here she was, her attitude having flipped completely. This had dumbfounded Leylin.</p>
 <p>Lucian was the same. He who was at the Crystal Phase was the strongest here, and sat quietly in a corner, drinking smugly. Unfortunately, everyone had already accepted such behaviour as a norm.</p>
 <p>Even if he rolled his eyes internally, Leylin understood that he could only do things according to the rules.</p>
 <p>”Senior Lucian has always been like this. He has suffered a lot previously, and just can’t bring himself out of it!” Robin transmitted after noticing Leylin’s gaze.</p>
 <p>”Actually, he’s extremely delighted at your breakthrough. Normally, he wouldn’t even deign to take a glance at a banquet invitation!”</p>
 <p>Perhaps because he was Gilbert’s butler, Robin’s communication and observation skills were outstanding. Just a glimpse at Leylin in his peripheral vision and he’d realised things, explaining Lucian’s attitude.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry, I understand!” Leylin smiled wryly. Even if Lucian decided not to show him respect, he could do nothing about it.</p>
 <p>Even with all his trump cards, Leylin could at most deal with a Hydro Phase rank 3 Magus. With that kind of difference in strength, it was useless to talk about it. Had Lucian not considered his Mentor Gilbert and the fact that it was Leylin’s first invitation, he might not even have come.</p>
 <p>”Oh, right! Let me introduce you to my apprentice, Snoopy!” A reserved youth walked up at Leylin’s introduction, a dimpled smile on his pockmarked face.</p>
 <p>”He… Hello distinguished masters!” Snoopy greeted all the Magi, stumbling on his words.</p>
 <p>A few rank 3 Warlocks merely nodded aloofly and did not pay much attention, and even Kesha’s 2 younger generations looked down on him.</p>
 <p>They could see Snoopy’s Black Horrall Snake bloodline at one glance. Even though a rank 3 Warlock bloodline was considered a big deal even in the central continent, those with higher bloodlines thought nothing of it.</p>
 <p>Immediately, they linked this sight to Leylin’s top subordinate, Parker and guessed the motives behind Leylin’s acceptance of this apprentice. They would naturally not pay any more attention, but on account of Leylin, they had nodded their heads in recognition.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, Leylin had only brought Snoopy out for exposure, and quickly dismissed him after he had bowed to everyone.</p>
 <p>Snoopy’s response was quick, and his withdrawal was even faster. With a tinge of embarrassment on his face, it appeared to Leylin as if he was fleeing.</p>
 <p>”This is the hierarchy of Warlocks!”</p>
 <p>Leylin sighed internally. In comparison, though Kesha’s 2 younger generations were slightly lower in strength, because their bloodline was distinguished and there was the possibility of making a breakthrough to rank 4, they would immediately receive more attention. Even the rank 3 Elders would consider this normal.</p>
 <p>For Warlocks, even though bloodline could not determine your lowest achievements, it could dictate your greatest.</p>
 <p>Take for example the two Giant Kemoyin Serpent Warlocks Kesha had brought along. They needed only to put a bit more effort and spend more time, and it would be child’s play to reach the Vapour and even Hydro Phase. However, the advancement to the Crystal Phase depended on one’s innate talent. As for the breakthrough to the Morning Star realm, innate talent alone was not enough. There was a huge amount of luck to be factored into it!</p>
 <p>After all, they were not first generation Giant Kemoyin Serpent Warlocks. Their bloodline was not as pure, and could not allow for the adults to easily advance to rank 4.</p>
 <p>In actual fact, in the entire Ouroboros Clan, there were already no more absolutely pureblood Giant Kemoyin Serpent Warlocks. Their bloodlines had faded with the passage of time. For the three elders to break through to the Morning Star realm required not only a large amount of resources and effort, but also a stroke of luck.</p>
 <p>Leylin did not know how pure his bloodline was, but the A.I Chip and the recognition by the few seniors and Mentors seemed to suggest that it was not too bad.</p>
 <p>In fact, he had immense confidence in the bloodline purification skills of the A.I Chip.</p>
 <p>During the period of time he was in the Ouroboros Clan, he had discovered that even in the central continent, there were no microscopes here that could form images at the genetic and atomic levels.</p>
 <p>Their research at most halted at the cells. Their best microscopes could at most see the structure of a cell.</p>
 <p>Previously, the A.I Chip had directly extracted the part of the genes that belonged to the Giant Kemoyin Serpent from the bloodline essence of the Black Horrall Snake, and reconstructed them.</p>
 <p>Leylin even suspected that the bloodline within his body could compare to that of a first generation Giant Kemoyin Serpent Warlock!</p>
 <p>Mind you, that was a bloodline that allowed a Warlock to progress to the Morning Star realm automatically as he aged.</p>
 <p>Leylin’s own improvement had been too rapid. He was only a hundred years old, an infant among Giant Kemoyin Serpent Warlocks. Thus, he did not have a deep enough understanding of the frightening potential of his bloodline.</p>
 <p>Still, it took way too long for Giant Kemoyin Serpents to mature. If he was to advance at the same rate as his bloodline would let him, he would only be a rank 1 Warlock as of now. With the passing of time, he would feel his spiritual force growing slightly even if he did nothing but sleep all day. After finishing semi-conversion and complete conversion, his strength would soar. At about 500 years of age, he would become a rank 3 Warlock. As for a Morning Star Warlock? That would take him until he was 900 if he only depended on his bloodline.</p>
 <p>In other words, Leylin’s current improvement was rapid to the point that his bloodline could not keep up with him.</p>
 <p>‘Even if I have almost 900 years of life according to the A.I. Chip, the risks with waiting that long are way too high!’ he thought as he stroked his chin. On top of that, Leylin can’t be sure that the purity of his bloodline was enough for a breakthrough to the Morning Star stage by the time he reaches 900.</p>
 <p>As such, he would continue to work hard!</p>
 <p>At the very least, his bloodline shackle would not retard his progress before he hit rank 4, and he would be able to advance to that realm without any obstacles.</p>
 <p>“Penny for your thoughts?” His introspection had obviously drawn Robin’s attention.</p>
 <p>”Oh… It’s…” Leylin summarised his ruminations on his bloodline growth, obviously concealing his conjecture on its purity and instead diverting the conversation to how he could develop his bloodline.</p>
 <p>”...So, you wish to find out whether there are any medicines or materials the Ouroboros Clan uses to speed up bloodline growth?” Robin looked at Leylin, and did not know whether to laugh or cry.</p>
 <p>”Many Warlocks depend on the strength of their bloodlines when using their meditation techniques to slowly improve in ranks. A case like yours, where the host’s strength surpasses that of the bloodline’s growth is extremely unlikely…”</p>
 <p>”Unlikely, but not impossible!” Leylin was determined. The central continent had many groundbreaking talents, and the Ouroboros Clan was where Giant Kemoyin Serpent Warlocks congregated. There must be a way!</p>
 <p>Still, any solutions that existed were sure to be extremely precious and hidden. Leylin had never seen such a thing in the trading hall.</p>
 <p>“Indeed. Like you, Leylin, our organisation has had a few Warlocks in the past whose strengths far surpassed their age!”</p>
 <p>Kesha interrupted, “And they used a top-notch precious material to increase the growth of their bloodline to remarkable results!”</p>
 <p>”What material?” Leylin’s eyes glowed.</p>
 <p>”Lamia Hair!” Kesha did not intend to leave Leylin in suspense, and gave him a specific term.</p>
 <p>”A.I Chip!” Leylin recited internally: “Query the database for Lamia Hair!”</p>
 <p>Collecting data and books was habitual for him. Naturally, he hadn’t slacked off on it in his time in the Ouroboros Clan.</p>
 <p>The Ouroboros Clan was a major power of the central continent. Its library had a rich collection of data, and since Leylin was a Marquis, he had little restriction on what he could read, and had thus expanded his database significantly. What was remaining was naturally not too big a problem.</p>
 <p>Although he could not claim that he knew everything about the central continent, the knowledge he had accumulated in this period would not lose out to that of a scholar who was a few hundred years old.</p>
 <p>[Lamia Hair: It is an ancient precious material. Legend has it that a strand of hair from the ancient Lamia has a extremely horrifying ability. Rank: 3, Rarity: 4, Description: The Lamia was an extremely tyrannical being in ancient times. Other than strange spells, they were experts at controlling lower serpents to attack, and normally lorded over snakes! Legend has it that they were direct descendants of the Snake Dowager, and were comparable to Radiant Moon Magi in adulthood!]</p>
 <p>Leylin saw the description given by the A.I Chip and could not help but smile wryly.</p>
 <p>A description in terms of rank and rarity was standard on the central continent. Rank 3 indicated that the material was only effective for rank 3 Magi, while the rank 4 rarity meant only Morning Star Magi could get their hands on one.</p>
 <p>Needless to say, the assessment on how it could compare to a Radiant Moon Magus in adulthood shocked Leylin completely.</p>
 <p>A Radiant Moon Magus was at rank 5! They exceeded Morning Star Magi by one full rank, and there were few Magi on the central continent who possessed such strength.</p>
 <p>How would Leylin, who could not afford to offend even a single Morning Star Magus, dare to think of a plan involving Radiant Moon Magi?</p>
 <p>Of course, the strength of the beings themselves was one matter, the resources were yet another.</p>
 <p>”For senior Kesha to mention it, could it be that Mentor has strands of Lamia Hair?” Leylin’s eyes lit up. The ancient Lamia had been extinct for a long period of time. But some remains could have been discovered by Magi, and it would be extremely normal to obtain these resources as a result.</p>
