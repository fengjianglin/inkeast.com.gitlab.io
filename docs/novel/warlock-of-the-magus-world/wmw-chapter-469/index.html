 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Multi-Armed Race</strong></span></p>
 <p>This was the result of the natural radiation of a creature which had achieved the Morning Star realm.</p>
 <p>The space in the hillside was even larger, and many creatures’ remains were casually abandoned at one side. The remaining energy waves on them made Leylin feel suffocated.</p>
 <p>In the middle the platform, the livers of all kinds of animals were casually laid out at one side. An entirely black boiler foamed with white bubbles, making Leylin feel as if he was seeing a shaman of his old world.</p>
 <p>Be it the insignia on one side or the totem, they were all decorated with bloody brown symbols.</p>
 <p>This was Leylin’s evaluation: the entire hillside seemed just like an unsophisticated laboratory, but it already possessed a certain ability for research.</p>
 <p>In a flash, the large Multi-Armed Race being threw Leylin’s seed onto an altar in the middle as the surrounding blood-red emblems immediately emitted a faint radiance.</p>
 <p>Leylin suddenly felt as if he was isolated from his surroundings, and even if he wanted to explode, he could do nothing at all.</p>
 <p>“Spell formation of a different tribe? Pretty interesting!” With the seed in their hands, the worst thing that could happen was just to lose it, hence Leylin was not especially afraid.</p>
 <p>“The other… world’s… spiritual force seed?” At this time, the Multilimb Clan member spoke. Using the ancient Byron language, he stuttered slightly, but Leylin managed to understand his words.</p>
 <p>“Yes, honourable sir! I am a space traveller, and I accidentally ended up here!”</p>
 <p>Leylin’s heart soared. Being able to communicate meant that there was hope for a transaction. “Do you know the ancient Byron language?”</p>
 <p>“Yes! Although we of the Quark tribe have already experienced 3 extinctions, our civilisation’s legacy has never been gone!” The large Multi-Armed Race being seemed very proud.</p>
 <p>Leylin nodded. In such a brutal tribe, the clan leader, witch doctors and leaders always had deep knowledge. This was a rule that held true in almost every world.</p>
 <p>“As you have seen, I am currently only a spiritual force seed, which has nearly dissipated and poses no threat. May I know if it is possible to make a deal with you?” Leylin told him his requirements.</p>
 <p>The spiritual force seed needed the person’s own spiritual force to work, and now, it could be said that time was counting down to its annihilation. Even if the other party had a way, they could only delay it at most, without being able to solve the root of the problem.</p>
 <p>Moreover, the journey to the Blackrain World this time was entirely accidental. It was impossible to create a space passageway even if he wanted to. Thus, he needed to obtain some valuable items immediately.</p>
 <p>From Leylin’s point of view, the Multi-Armed Race member who had already achieved the strength of the Morning Star realm largely fulfilled the requirements.</p>
 <p>“Are you really doing this just for a deal?” The Multi-Armed Race member’s eyes were full of distrust, and even more of cautiousness. The blood-red runes on the insignia twinkled, and it actually emitted energy waves similar to that of a lie detector.</p>
 <p>“Of course!” Leylin answered without hesitation, almost believing his own lie.</p>
 <p>“You are only left with a little bit of spiritual force, I’m afraid we have not much to discuss. Moreover, the previous disasters were all brought about by you all…”</p>
 <p>The large Multi-armed Race member evidently showed distrust towards Leylin. The entire altar began to rotate, almost wanting to destroy Leylin’s spiritual force seed completely.</p>
 <p>‘Bitch. Which bastard came first? They’re making things hard for those of us who came later…’ Leylin scolded in his heart. Still, he immediately shouted, “Wait, you don't need my things, but I’m sure your clan members do. I have a lot of remarkable information from different planes, including lots on organisational systems, planting, smelting, alloy-making, even potion-making and alchemy. I believe they will definitely be helpful to you and your clan…”</p>
 <p>“I can obtain these items directly from you…” The large Multi-Armed Race member laughed coldly. Streaks of blood-red lines emerged on the altar, even scheming to penetrate the spiritual force seed.</p>
 <p>“So it's this kind of soul-searching method!” Leylin’s spiritual force seed suddenly shook, emitting a great dark gold radiance.</p>
 <p>The streaks of blood-red spiritual force were drowned in the bronze radiance in a flash. Right after that, Leylin’s spiritual force seed seemed to be more illusory, as if it would be forcibly destroyed in the next moment.</p>
 <p>“As you have seen, this method is ineffective on me. Even more forced methods will not benefit us both in the end…”</p>
 <p>Leylin was secretly relieved. This Multi-Armed Morning Star being only broke through to the Morning Star Realm based on his body strength. Similar to that male scorpion in the Icy World, it was a representation of power. Hence, its experience with regards to the spiritual world was still very feeble.</p>
 <p>Such a creature could use its strong strength to beat up Leylin, but its power was inadequate to carry out a complicated job like soul-searching.</p>
 <p>Should Leylin’s spiritual force seed end up in the hands of a similar Morning Star Magus who concentrated on spiritual force, he would only be left with the road to annihilation, even having many of his memories opened up for the other to see.</p>
 <p>But with Leylin being at the Crystal Phase, it was still possible to somewhat confront a barbarian with Morning Star strength. In the worst case, he could order the spiritual force seed to self-destruct, leaving the other party with nothing to gain.</p>
 <p>“What exactly do you want?” The Multi-Armed Race member’s expression turned sour.</p>
 <p>”Simple. An equal exchange—both parties will provide valuable information, and as the outsider, I am willing to offer a portion first!”</p>
 <p>Leylin’s spiritual force seed vibrated, and sent a few books of information written in the ancient Byron language over shortly after.</p>
 <p>In those were some primitive introductions of systems, and simple agriculture and alchemy techniques. Although it was not of much help to a matured Multi-Armed Race member who was at least rank 1, it was still enough to use as reference.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, at the end of the information, Leylin specially attached some information on methods of setting up spell formations to refine their physical bodies, as well as knight-training manuals that were commonly seen in the central continent. Although it was just a starter, it was still valuable.</p>
 <p>The Multi-Armed Race, a bunch which concentrated on physical strength, would definitely be more interested in items in this aspect.</p>
 <p>Indeed, towards the agricultural techniques and other information that Leylin sent earlier, the large Multi-Armed Race member did not show any interest. Instead, he appeared very intrigued by the proposed killing techniques.</p>
 <p>“ An interesting item!” the large Multi-Armed Race member nodded, “The body refinement spell formations in here is enough to strengthen our children slightly. As for the last part about the killing techniques, although the structure is different, it can still provide some insights. I need the last part!”</p>
 <p>“Then may I ask what you have in exchange?” Leylin was no longer anxious now that he had proven his worth. All that was left was for the other party to make his offer.</p>
 <p>“You…” The large Multi-Armed Race member growled, but Leylin was not the least bit bothered.</p>
 <p>If he were in his original body, he would naturally be very polite to the other party to protect his life. However, the worst case scenario was only losing a spiritual force seed. It was not a big deal, and hence, he was not anxious.</p>
 <p>“What do you want?” Evidently, this Multi-Armed Race member also knew that now, Leylin was not afraid of him at all, and would not succumb to threats. If he still wanted that information, he could only give in.</p>
 <p>“I am very interested in your training methods. Maybe…” Leylin tried asking. He was there to search for a way to increase his strength. Anything in that regard would definitely be very valuable.</p>
 <p>A person such as this Multi-Armed Race member seemed to show hope for his own body to break through.</p>
 <p>“We Quark tribe people are born warriors. Our strength is not trained, Instead, we are born with it!” The large Multi-Armed Race member proclaimed proudly.</p>
 <p>Leylin rolled his eyes, “Then why is there still a great difference between you and your clan members?”</p>
 <p>Creatures that had achieved Morning Star level in their adulthood, were all abnormally terrifying species. This Multi-Armed Race was not worthy to claim itself as the Quark tribe.</p>
 <p>At the very most, they were only capable creatures with hopes of breakthrough to the Morning Star level. This piqued Leylin’s interest, and he wanted to conduct research on it.</p>
 <p>In fact, the Multi-Armed Race were also bloodline creatures. However, they were able to advance continuously, to a point that such monsters with Morning Star strength existed. This lifted Leylin’s spirits.</p>
 <p>If he studied their ways of obtaining strength, would he be able to find a method to break through the bloodline shackles?</p>
 <p>“That is a top secret of our Quark tribe. How can we reveal that?” The large Multi-Armed Race member rejected straight away without hesitation.</p>
 <p>“I don’t need it to be in-depth. Just the simplest and most basic explanations will be enough. What do you think of that? As long as you give me this information, I can give you all of the missing parts about the spell formation, as well as the next chapter of the killing techniques from before!” Leylin tempted enthusiastically.</p>
 <p>To the A.I. Chip, these most basic things were the most important, because they represented the foundation of the system! As long as the foundation was complete, based on the deductive ability of the A.I. Chip, there would be a day when this Multi-Armed Race’s hidden secrets would be laid bare before Leylin.</p>
 <p>”You give it to me first!” The large Multi-Armed Race member said.</p>
 <p>Leylin pondered for a while before giving a proposition. “From the current situation, none of us will trust the other side. How about each of us hand over the information to the other party at the same time?”</p>
 <p>“Alright!” The large Multi-Armed Race member agreed helplessly.</p>
 <p>A huge wave of energy was emitted from its horns and entered Leylin’s spiritual force seed.</p>
 <p>[Detected influx of spiritual force, accept?]</p>
 <p>“Accept!” Following Leylin’s order, the curtains to the path for evolution was slowly unveiled.</p>
 <p>Leylin did not go against his words as well. While receiving the information, he transmitted a large amount of information simultaneously.</p>
 <p>When the transaction was over, both parties were relatively satisfied with their gains.</p>
 <p>“Very well, visitor from the other world. You didn't deceive me!” The large Multi-Armed Race member was evidently delighted.</p>
 <p>“Of course. This transaction marks the beginning of our trust, and hopefully in the future, we will still…Oh damn!” Leylin spoke halfway and his tone suddenly became exasperated.</p>
 <p>The spiritual force seed that represented his existence suddenly became illusory, exploding into a ball of light shortly after and vanishing without any trace…</p>
