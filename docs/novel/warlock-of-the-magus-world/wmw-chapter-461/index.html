 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Trade</strong></span></p>
 <p>Leylin noticed that after those two Magi left, a few others in the cave had secretly followed along. Under the enormous temptation, it was evident that Magi did not mind being robbers every once in awhile.</p>
 <p>‘It’s a pity that compared to the Oakheart clan, your methods are too cheap…’ Leylin sighed and glanced up at the stage once more.</p>
 <p>When the Magus left the stage, another black ball of light streaked over to the position. A friendly male voice sounded, “Ladies and gentlemen, what I shall now display is…”</p>
 <p>Leylin watched on detachedly. The items on display were on a whole other level compared to the auction, and there were many precious items, some of which could even be said to have already been lost to time.</p>
 <p>The prices of these medicines were lower. Most Magi demanded that their items be exchanged for other items, and they were even willing to trade for lower-levelled materials.</p>
 <p>There were few Magi who were like the one before, agreeing to trade for any item, and even agreeing to take magic crystals. Most clearly indicated what resources they required. If nobody had the item, they would not make the trade no matter how many magic crystals were offered up, and might leave regretfully.</p>
 <p>In general, though the items here were top-grade, so the chances of success were not very high.</p>
 <p>Halfway through the event, it was finally Leylin’s turn. He muttered to himself as he headed onto the stage, already sure of which items he was going to exhibit.</p>
 <p>An ancient black female crown, as well as a few multi-coloured potions, floated above his hands.</p>
 <p>“A piece of magic equipment, the Dark Elven Crown. Extremely effective in concealing large groups. There’s also a blood-igniting potion, divine potions and other top-grade potions!” With a push, these items all began to float, undulating with tempting lustre.</p>
 <p>“I wish to obtain an astral stone in exchange for all these, or a means to obtain astral stones…” He had produced these items after careful deliberation. The Blood-igniting potion and the many others were top-grade potions, and with his knowledge as a Potions Grandmaster, it was not difficult to brew them again as long as he had all the ingredients.</p>
 <p>The Dark Elven Crown was not of much use to him, and it did not quite match his own strength. It belonged to Twilight Zone, and Magi of the central continent would definitely be unable to tell its origins, which made it perfect for sale.</p>
 <p>Bloodline treasures or refined bloodlines held very obvious markings that could very well expose him. Unless it was absolutely necessary, Leylin had no wish to sell them.</p>
 <p>It had to be said that the items Leylin had displayed were all very practical. The Dark Elven Crown was a piece magic equipment after all, and was definitely valuable.</p>
 <p>However, with all of the items together, he would probably only be able to obtain an astral stone the size of a little finger. If he obtained information on how to acquire them, that would be quite generous.</p>
 <p>Leylin watched the Magi downstairs expectantly. To construct an astral gate, it might not even be enough to sell himself away to gather enough astral stones. He had no high hopes, however, as constructing astral gates was something only Morning Star Magi were capable of.</p>
 <p>All he wished now was to obtain resources to proceed with the preliminary research. For this reason, he merely needed a few of astral stones.</p>
 <p>However, the rarity of astral stones exceeded Leylin’s expectations. Though the items he was exhibiting caused a commotion amongst the Magi, nobody was willing to make this trade.</p>
 <p>If they planned to use information, they lacked real news. One could not underestimate Magi; they were extremely sensitive to the authenticity of this sort of information. The Magi below were also unable to bring any news that would be able to cheat Leylin.</p>
 <p>Leylin sighed inside.</p>
 <p>All of a sudden, he saw one of the black blobs of light flickering at the corner of his eye.</p>
 <p>Elated, he immediately commanded the A.I. Chip to use its scanning abilities at full power, even emanating tempting ripples that lured the stardust bugs on the other party’s body to cooperate.</p>
 <p>In the A.I. Chip’s field of vision, the figure of an old man vaguely appeared. The image from the stardust bugs that Leylin had coerced might have been blurry, but it was enough for Leylin to recognise who he was. This man was someone he had seen before!</p>
 <p>‘It’s Vance, the head of the Rolithe family?’ Leylin immediately let go of his hesitation and turned to leave the stage.</p>
 <p>“Ladies and gentlemen, what I wish to trade is…” The moment he left, another Magus came up in a hurry, producing materials gained from high-energy creatures. He went on and on, introducing the item...</p>
 <p>When everyone Magus had gone up once, Leo immediately announced that the event would now continue to the free exchange segment.</p>
 <p>This free exchange meant that all the Magi present would have a place to display the items they wished to sell. It was just like a street stall.</p>
 <p>This was also the last chance for Magi who had not profited at all from before.</p>
 <p>Even if they could not obtain resources they were in urgent need of, they could also sell things here and exchange for more regular items, such as magic crystals.</p>
 <p>However, there were Magi who were already content or had no interest in magic crystals who left the anonymous barter after the first segment by the teleportation spell formation.</p>
 <p>Leylin unhurriedly came before an area and displayed the Dark Elven Crown and top-grade potions he had exhibited previously. He mentioned that he would only accept astral stones, and had no intentions of obtaining magic crystals.</p>
 <p>He caught a glimpse of Vance, who was hesitating not far away, and grinned.</p>
 <p>He was now ‘fishing’. The other party had not come forward for some unknown reason, but he definitely had an astral stone or might have some information about it. All this meant hope to Leylin.</p>
 <p>“Sire, may I see what you have?” Unexpectedly enough, before Vance came over, another person had been attracted to his stall.</p>
 <p>This person had blond hair and a very amiable smile. In the entire floor, the only person not using magic to conceal himself would be Leo.</p>
 <p>“So it’s Lord Leo. Of course, but I will only accept astral stones!” Leylin waved his arms, his voice already changed using the A.I. Chip. He was thus not recognised.</p>
 <p>“Tsk tsk… This magic equipment’s design is very ancient, and even holds the style of the ancient Gloomy Forest region…” Leo evidently had no eyes for the top-grade potions at Leylin’s stall, but was evidently unwilling to part with this dark elven magic equipment.</p>
 <p>“My apologies!” After staring at it for a long while, Leo finally put down the crown regretfully.</p>
 <p>“I have a female cousin who really likes things of this style. On top of that, this is even magic equipment! I hope to buy it, so just tell me a price in terms of magic crystals…”</p>
 <p>Leo’s expression showed his sincerity. With his status, it was very rare that he would speak so amicably.</p>
 <p>“I’m sorry, but I’m not lacking in magic crystals. I only want astral stones, no matter how small!” Leylin politely rejected him, “I’m sorry, but you’re in the way.”</p>
 <p>There were a few Magi waiting to watch a good show here with Leo around, but the blob of light that signified Vance seemed to be shrinking back.</p>
 <p>“Hehe… Sire, if you are willing to sell it, you shall gain a good relationship with our Oakheart clan!” Leo focused on the black bundle of light in front of him, eyes seeming to look past the concealing formation at Leylin’s face.</p>
 <p>“What? Is the Oakheart clan threatening me?” Leylin’s voice went higher, attracting the attention of many Magi.</p>
 <p>“Of course not, you’re misunderstanding! I was just impatient. My apologies!” This had not gone the way Leo had expected. It was the first time a Magus had not taken his clan into account.</p>
 <p>The prestige of his clan was the foundation of this very auction. He bowed in apology, but a sinister trace glinted in his eyes.</p>
 <p>‘You… you dare treat me this way?’ He silently sent down a command, and Leylin quickly found that the stardust bugs that he had hypnotised into submission had received a command. They would reveal information about his looks and ranking, as well as crawl over his body so that he could be tracked.</p>
 <p>‘If this were a regular Magus, they would be in trouble, but to deal with me…’ Leylin sneered inside, ‘A.I. Chip, send fake fluctuations!’</p>
 <p>[Mission established, beginning task…] Soon enough, false information was transmitted to Leo through formless undulations, and successfully sent information on his location.</p>
 <p>“Hehe… Sire, here is a portion of an astral stone as compensation!” Already thinking of Leylin as a dead man, Leo magnanimously produced a purple embroidered case and placed it before Leylin.</p>
 <p>‘Oh? I’m unexpectedly profiting?’ Leylin was delighted and opened the case, finding an astral stone the size of a quail egg.</p>
 <p>“I only wanted to try purchasing with magic crystals. Since you are unwilling to accept it, I can only resign myself and part with this treasure.” Leo’s words were elegant, and he had even given up this astral stone that was even more valuable than anything Leylin had on display. He successfully reversed the image of his clan.</p>
 <p>“Oh! I was much too hurried just now. My apologies.” Leylin knew when to stop and placed the cosmic stone back properly, “All these items are now yours!” he pointed at the potions and crown at his stall.</p>
 <p>With what he had, he could at most only obtain an astral stone the size of a pinky, but Leo had given him one the size of a quail egg. This meant Leylin had obviously gotten the better end of the deal.</p>
 <p>Leo kept everything from the stall properly while observing Leylin. He was especially careful with the Dark Elven Crown, though he was snickering inside.</p>
 <p>‘You must be proud, huh? Excited? It’s a pity, but you’ll only be taking care of that astral stone for a short period of time before you’ll have to spit it out obediently, and even give me your life while you’re at it!’</p>
