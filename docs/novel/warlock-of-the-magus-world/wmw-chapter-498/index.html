 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Confrontation </strong></span></p>
 <p>The Crystal Phase Magi who were on site held their breaths for a moment.</p>
 <p>In the past, small organisations like the Arm of Vengeance could only be low-profile, as they would be attacked on site. When did they get the guts to begin a fight?</p>
 <p>A well-built Warlock suddenly stood up and exclaimed, “I want to go out and kill them all!”</p>
 <p>“Don’t be rash!” Faisal responded while holding the person back, “With the combined defensive spell formation already activated, attacking them now will only ruin our only chances to turn the odds around! Do not let your emotions cloud your judgement!”</p>
 <p>Faisal truly was quite capable. At the very least, he was not a fool and could see through ordinary schemes.</p>
 <p>But then again, looking at how the enemy was valiantly showing off in front of him, Faisal must have been filled with anger as well; he was only forcing himself to hold back and not act rashly.</p>
 <p>“Once this ordeal is over, I will lead my team out again and have all these rats killed!”</p>
 <p>“Guys, look at this!” Freya exclaimed, pouting out the window towards the troops.</p>
 <p>“Eh?!”</p>
 <p>At this point in time, most of the Warlocks had not realised that the massive spell formation that Robert had cast earlier was gradually activating.</p>
 <p>*Rumble!* The earth shook repeatedly, giving rise to landslides that covered up the wetlands with all their sludge and sewage. The phosphorescence in the air rapidly dissipated.</p>
 <p>After the phosphorescence disappeared, the large amount of steam that evaporated from the wetlands turned it into a field of mud and soil. The soil became more compact, and eventually gained a rock-like texture.</p>
 <p>These tumultuous changes occurred all along the spell formation.</p>
 <p>“How dare they touch our base!” many enraged Warlocks started to cry out.</p>
 <p>The Ouroboros Clan back then had decided to chose this area precisely due to the unique phosphorescent wetlands. The abundant amount of darkness elemental energy particles and fire elemental particles that were present there matched perfectly with the bloodline of the Giant Kemoyin Serpent.</p>
 <p>Not only was the growth of the Warlocks boosted in this place, but it even enhanced the power of their spells.</p>
 <p>However, the destruction of large swathes of wetlands meant that the darkness elemental particles and fire elemental particles were gradually diminished, to be replaced by earth elemental particles.</p>
 <p>Even though the area affected was only this city, the impact it had on the high-level Warlocks was not small.</p>
 <p>“Haha… Robert who was outside laughed out loud unexpectedly.</p>
 <p>“Did you think we hadn’t planned out our revenge? What a big mistake! Even though we were chased all over the central continent, we never once stopped plotting our vengeance. This time round, we’ll uproot the entire Ouroboros Clan!”</p>
 <p>“There is no other way!” Looking at how the city gradually turned into a wasteland, and how the concentration of earth elemental particles slowly outweighed the now-meagre amount of darkness and fire elemental particles, Faisal’s face turned pale.</p>
 <p>“Alchemised puppets, attack! Work with the combined spell formation!” After he gave the orders, his face displayed a moment of shame. He had a sudden realisation that he himself actually initiated the entire defence spell formation, and all of this seemed too rushed.</p>
 <p>Especially after giving his last orders, it seemed as though he was slapping himself across the face.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing his actions, Freya and the other Warlocks could only sigh under their breaths. Faisal was relieved that they did not condemn him upfront.</p>
 <p>“At least there are still some smart people around!” Lucian surreptitiously nodded his head. Knowing that they had reached a point of life and death, it was not the time for resentments and conspiracies.</p>
 <p>From their common bloodline, it was already predetermined that these Warlocks would not obtain the mercy of the rest.</p>
 <p>*Crack!* The translucent spell formation that once enveloped the city had split open to form a large opening that had a current of steel streaming out from it.</p>
 <p>*Clank! Clank!* What appeared in front of Robert’s eyes was a giant troop of steel puppets.</p>
 <p>All these alchemised puppets were at least three metres tall, with intricate runes covering the bodies. The barb wires and hooks that hung on their bodies stood out reflected chilling lights.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, the massive barrels that hung on both sides of the puppets sent chills down Robert’s spine.</p>
 <p>“Portable spell-casting barrels! The Ouroboros Clan is not only gifted in bloodlines!” A masked boy, who was in the corner observing the whole scene, started to record everything down immediately.</p>
 <p>Simultaneously, he asked another observer behind him, “Have you recorded every movement that occurred since the activation of the spell formation?”</p>
 <p>The young girl, who only seemed to be seven-or-eight years old and was wearing oversized spectacles and a massive red ribbon, replied formally, “Yes Sir! Everything has been recorded clearly and the energy nodes have all been marked! In the process of calculating the geographical locations of the pressure points and the core!”</p>
 <p>“Very good! Continue recording it down! Such micronised cannon spells are still very useful. Remember to inform the rest of our people and I propose that we get this technology in our hands during the distribution of the spoils.”</p>
 <p>The masked man waved, clearly in high spirits. To him, breaking through the headquarters was only a matter of time.</p>
 <p>“Target locked on! Beginning fire!” The steel puppets that walked out from the city had lasers for eyes that marked a luminous red cursor on their targets. Robert and most of the Magi were locked on to. Just then, sounds of machinery could be heard within their bodies.</p>
 <p>“Not good! Hurry up and hide—” Robert couldn’t finish his sentence before he was disrupted by the glow of a white laser.</p>
 <p>*Pew!* The white laser beam swept through the area horizontally, disintegrating anything that stood in its path. Even the ground caved in where it passed.</p>
 <p>“No!” “Sir!” urgent and sharp cries were heard.</p>
 <p>A number of Magi did not even have a chance to speak before the laser burned them to ashes.</p>
 <p>Even a rank 3 Magus like Robert was put in a difficult situation because of the lasers. His clothes had been destroyed, and his wooden leg had vanished into thin air.</p>
 <p>“Initiate destruction!” a cold voice rang out once again, and the steel puppets reacted, firing towards the remains.</p>
 <p>It took but a moment for chaos to ensue. Light flashed everywhere, and many of the Magi were severely injured.</p>
 <p>The massive spell formation that had been operating till now was destroyed immediately, and the earth started to stabilise.</p>
 <p>“Tsk! How dare such a small organisation provoke the prestigious Ouroboros clan!” Faisal laughed out.</p>
 <p>“The real enemy hasn’t even begun attacking, and yet you’re satisfied beating these mere distractions,” Freya said coldly while rolling her eyes.</p>
 <p>It was indeed true that destroying the Arm of Vengeance was a piece of cake for the Ouroboros Clan. A simple slightly-powerful formation would be enough to send them packing, and even the heavens above would not be able to save them.</p>
 <p>However, what worried the Magi the most was how these hostile forces could cold-bloodedly watch the members of the Arm of Vengeance die so easily. They did not seem to even consider the possibility of helping the battered and exhausted Robert out, which was why they stopped considering the option of initiating the spell formation.</p>
 <p>“Sir! Why did…” Robert, who was seriously injured, shouted with a sore voice when he was finally saved. However, the rest of the members of the Arm of Vengeance were not as lucky as him; most of them fell at the hands of the steel puppets.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry. Your sacrifice will not be in vain! Now it’s time for us to avenge you,” A green-haired magus said coldly, sounding insincere. He had an air of steeliness about him.</p>
 <p>Yet, he was sneering secretly, ‘It’s only a given that we’ll reduce your strength and manpower after we’re done using it. Did you really expect us to leave you with so many benefits after the war? Dream on!’</p>
 <p>Not giving Robert, whose fists were clenched, a chance to say anything else, the green-haired Magus waved his hand, “Plant legion, attack!”</p>
 <p>*Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!* Many of the vines started moving and, within a moment’s time, a gigantic Man-eating Flower emerged from the mud and started moving towards the steel puppets.</p>
 <p>“Targets locked! Beginning the second wave of attack!” In front of the steel puppets stood a gigantic black steel robot which was more than five metres tall. After its laser eyes marked its target, the gun barrels that were hung on either side of its shoulders begin to roar.</p>
 <p>*Pew!* When the white lasers swept past the Man-eating Flowers, many of them fell and thick sludge started to permeate from their wounds.</p>
 <p>“Even the Azure Rain Knights would find these kinds of lasers hard to endure. Fortunately for my plant legion…” Looking at this scene, the green-haired Magus displayed a teasing smile.</p>
 <p>A large amount of spores started to shoot out from one of the Man-eating Flowers. Before these spores even reached the ground, they began to swell up into a giant ball, and within seconds another one emerged from the earth. The two intertwined, forming a gigantic one, at least ten metres tall, that swallowed the huge puppet from earlier.</p>
 <p>The earth rumbled as a war of green and black, nature and machine played out. These two incredible forces were fighting head on against each other. The whole surroundings were filled with white rays and green sludge.</p>
 <p>Looking at the scene outside, Lucian sighed.</p>
 <p>“I’m afraid that they’ve already found out about our last defence system from their earlier experiments, even keeping their battlefront exactly one kilometer away which exactly reaches our boundary of attack.”</p>
 <p>Faisal’s face turned black. Even though none of them said it out loud, everyone knew that this was his fault for initiating the combined spell formation too hastily.</p>
 <p>At this moment, another Crystal Phase Warlock screamed, “Look at this!”</p>
 <p>*Gush!* All the Crystal Phase Magi looked up. The sky was enveloped by the giant shadow of a sail that enveloped the place in complete darkness.</p>
 <p>“Initiate warzone number 2’s all-over attack!”</p>
 <p>*Bang! Bang! Bang!* Like shooting stars falling from the skies, bombs were thrown down from the giant ships above, wiping away the mess created by the Man-eating Flowers and puppets.</p>
 <p>Under these terrible attacks, the original giant puppets became a pile of scrap iron.</p>
