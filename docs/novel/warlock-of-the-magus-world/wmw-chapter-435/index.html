 <p>“No matter the profits or losses, it is time to leave.”</p>
 <p>Leylin nodded, approving of Robin’s suggestion.</p>
 <p>He had gained quite a lot this time, and had long since had the inclination to leave. More importantly, his pursuer, Tanasha, had surrendered into his service. The Green-skinned Barbarian Magus was also heavily injured, and only after being extorted precious materials from was he released. As for the road that Robin had taken, it was evident that it had been disastrous.</p>
 <p>These were Crystal Phase Magi! The three powers outside would probably be stamping their feet in anxiety.</p>
 <p>By the time they reacted to the situation, Leylin and the others would probably be met with the joint attack from the three powers.</p>
 <p>On Leylin’s end, the Black Horrall Snake Warlocks that Robin and Roya had brought were all dead, and those following Kesha were probably in a similar situation. Arcus, who Leylin had rescued, had not met with them here. This would only have happened if he had other plans, or he had met with some unexpected situation, causing his strength to be greatly diminished.</p>
 <p>If they did not choose to escape now, were they going to wait to be killed?</p>
 <p>“Alright, I agree as well.” Kesha sounded helpless. Out of everyone here, she had gained the least, and it was not even enough to make up for the loss of the three Warlocks from her family. When she returned, this would be a huge blow to them.</p>
 <p>Anxiety was apparent in Kesha’s eyes.</p>
 <p>“As for the way out, it’s definitely impossible to go through the entrance of the pocket dimension. We should use our original plan and look for the weaker areas of the pocket dimension, and use escape runes to tear through the space and exit!” Robin exclaimed.</p>
 <p>The entrance of the secret realm had probably been placed under heavy military guard long ago by the three organisations. Leylin and Kesha would not suggest leaving that way, and they all nodded in agreement.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Under the scorching rays of the sun, the moisture in the ground evaporated, cracks appearing within.</p>
 <p>Somewhere, many cracks converged and caused a terrifying explosion. A hole opened up in the void, and a few pitiful figures dashed out of a tunnel.</p>
 <p>“Based on these energy particles, it looks like we’ve successfully escaped and reached the Forgotten Land!” Leylin commented after sensing the energy particles that were so sparse that they could be overlooked around him as well as the desolate surroundings.</p>
 <p>“That’s right! This must be the Tuck Barren Lands close to the Forgotten Land, which is very close to the city of sins, Nefas!”</p>
 <p>Robin checked the surroundings, and he looked elated, “Leylin, I didn’t expect your abilities at calculating the areas where space is weak to be so impressive!”</p>
 <p>“Yes! Not only did you use the shortest time possible and find the place where space was weak, you also evaded space storms and chose a place that is closest to Nefas City!”</p>
 <p>It was no simple task to find the weakest spatial node in a pocket dimension. For Magi, this would require a very precise and meticulous probing ability, and the requirements when it came to calculation were even more terrifying.</p>
 <p>“Hehe… What are you saying, that’s only a coincidence!” Leylin rubbed his nose.</p>
 <p>All these may seem difficult to a regular Magus, but for the A.I. Chip, it was just a walk in the park. He had even especially chosen a spatial node closest to Nefas City, all so he could leave that place as soon as possible.</p>
 <p>He had reaped marvelous gains this time, and he had a bad feeling about this. It was this feeling that prompted him to leave without hesitation, even so going so far as to expose some of his abilities.</p>
 <p>“It’s best that we leave as soon as possible. Something feels off.” Leylin furrowed his brows. The resources in the Quicksand pocket dimension were far too plentiful, and just the highly valued pocket dimension, Quicksand Castle, was enough to arouse the interest and greed of Morning Star Magi. A Morning Star Magus was not something any of them could handle.</p>
 <p>“I have a bad feeling about this too.” Robin looked grim as he agreed as well.</p>
 <p>Hearing this, Noah and Kesha could feel the seriousness of the situation. The premonitions or feelings that Magi had, especially that of high-ranked Magi like Leylin and Robin, were usually accurate. It did nothing to reassure them, causing them to tremble in fear.</p>
 <p>“Have the organisations in the Forgotten Land contacted the external world? Or is there any supporter of theirs?” Leylin asked Robin as the group of Magi hurried along lightning-quick.</p>
 <p>“Contact? They’re a bunch of vicious criminals, or those who can no longer stay in the central continent. How could there be any communication between them?” Robin scoffed at the idea.</p>
 <p>“They can’t even leave the Forgotten Land, and can at most conceal their identities in Nefas City.”</p>
 <p>At this point, his expression changed and he immediately halted his footsteps. “You mean…”</p>
 <p>Leylin’s expression was grim as he nodded.</p>
 <p>“What’s going on?” Noah was baffled, while Kesha seemed to have some thoughts on this, “The organisations within the Forgotten Land and Nefas City have contact with each other? Or…”</p>
 <p>She did not dare speak further, but the heavy atmosphere lingered in their hearts.</p>
 <p>“But what can we do if we don’t go to Nefas City? The airship station there is the most convenient way to communicate with the external world.” Kesha bit her lips.</p>
 <p>“Let’s take the long route.” Leylin let out a long breath.</p>
 <p>“This will take more effort. I’ve seen the map, and we’ll pass through a few dangerous areas with rank 3 Magi. However, as long as we’re careful, there’s a large possibility of us passing through, though it might take a bit more time…”</p>
 <p>Robin nodded, agreeing with Leylin. Though it was very troublesome to divert their route all based on a conjecture, Kesha and Noah exchanged a few glances and did not object.</p>
 <p>The Magus World was filled with danger, and any carelessness could lead to the misfortune of death.</p>
 <p>Those who could become high-ranked Magi were very confident in their premonitions, and would prefer to avoid any trouble even if it would cause them to expend more effort.</p>
 <p>The moment this group was about to turn around, there was an unexpected situation.</p>
 <p>*Ka-cha!* A huge hole opened up in the sky, and countless black streaks of lightning appeared with a thunderous sound..</p>
 <p>An incredibly mighty pressure suddenly descended, causing Leylin and the others to stand in a daze.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Leylin felt this whole region being isolated from the surroundings, and the air suddenly becoming heavier, to the point that he could not even move a finger.</p>
 <p>“This is… the domain of a Morning Star Magus! I’ve felt it before at my mentor’s. I can’t be wrong!”</p>
 <p>Robin turned back, face so pale it was like a corpse’s.</p>
 <p>“Found you!” A hoarse voice was transmitted from the black hole in the sky, cold, unfeeling and condescending. It was as if Leylin and his group were a bunch of insignificant little ants.</p>
 <p>Numerous black streaks of lightning twined around each other to form a black, giant palm, grabbing at Leylin and the rest.</p>
 <p>“Ah-!” Leylin wanted to retaliate, only to find that not only was it difficult to use the spiritual force in his body, even the sparse elemental particles in the external world had disappeared, as if they had become insulators of elemental particles.</p>
 <p>[Host body affected by unknown force field. Spiritual force suppressed by 80%. Stats in all areas decreasing.]</p>
 <p>The A.I. Chip’s voice sounded, being distorted as if it was being interfered with.</p>
 <p>In terms of Leylin’s own stats, there was a large decrease in all of his abilities, and he had been suppressed to about as strong as a rank 1 Magus.</p>
 <p>“The suppression from a Morning Star domain, and its influence, has turned us into elemental insulators!”</p>
 <p>A wry smile appeared at the corner of Leylin’s lips, “The terror of Morning Star Magi is something I can only hope to achieve!”</p>
 <p>Honestly speaking, he was still in a good condition. Kesha and Noah had already collapsed, leaving Robin and him somewhat able to stay standing. However, in front of the giant black-lightning palm, they were helpless.</p>
 <p>“Hmph! Cyril, it’s not up to you to give my students a lesson!” Just as even Leylin gave up all hope, a voice suddenly rang from beside him, a familiar sound immediately perking him up.</p>
 <p>“Mentor Gilbert!” Robin and Kesha exclaimed, delighted.</p>
 <p>Following that, Gilbert appeared by Robin in loose white robes, his two eyes turning into dangerous vertical pupils.</p>
 <p>*Ka-cha! Ka-cha!* Ash gray stone skin extended on the black lightning hand, and it eventually collapsed in mid-air, turning into a pile of powder as it sprayed downwards.</p>
 <p>*Po!* Like a soap bubble that had been pierced through, Leylin felt his body become lighter, the region he was in returning to the world. That feeling of being shrouded in a tight membrane disappeared.</p>
 <p>The numbers on the A.I. Chip were returning to normal, as was his contact with the elemental particles.</p>
 <p>[Beep! Detected reactions from two unknown force fields, resulting in a neutralizing effect.]</p>
 <p>The A.I. Chip prompted, and a look of comprehension flashed in Leylin’s eyes. ‘This is mentor’s Morning Star domain, cancelling out the other party’s force field!’</p>
 <p>He had also gained a deeper understanding of how formidable Morning Star Magi were.</p>
 <p>Without reaching the Morning Star realm, just a Morning Star domain was a torture to many low-ranked Magi. In the face of Morning Star Magi, the concept of strength in numbers was just a joke.</p>
 <p>“Giant Serpent Duke Gilbert!” A figure appeared in the sky suddenly, and though he was just standing there, Leylin felt that he was like a high mountain.</p>
 <p>“Demon Hunter Cyril!”</p>
 <p>Leylin lowered his head, taking a few secret peeks at the sky.</p>
 <p>Cyril’s face was gaunt, and his lips were very thin. He had a pair of silver eyes that could inspire fear and the Magus robes he wore, with black threads that formed demonic images and the many chains, axes and torture instruments along with, made him look frightening.</p>
 <p>“Wait here. I’ll go have a good talk with him.” Gilbert placed his arms at his back. Wrapped in dense crimson rays, he floated above and, with Cyril, transformed into two shooting stars that disappeared into the horizon.</p>
 <p>“Hah…” Robin let out a long breath and dropped to the ground. He no longer cared about his image.</p>
 <p>The situation just now could be said to be extremely dangerous. If Gilbert had not reached in time, they would probably be in a terrible state.</p>
