 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Banishment</strong></span></p>
 <p>“Arcanist civilisation must never be allowed to be revived. That is the bottom line!” Mystra announced first. The many gods who had gathered revealed a tacit understanding.</p>
 <p>While they were confident that their avatars could enter the floating city, they were still afraid of the enemy. Who knew if there were traps specifically meant for gods, left behind by the Great Arcanist in the city?</p>
 <p>“It’s not advisable to go against it for too long. How about we…” However, just as Oghma broke the silence, an astounding change happened in the city.</p>
 <p>Dazzling rays enveloped the city and teleportation rays filled the area, causing it to seem translucent.</p>
 <p>“Dimensional leap? No, it’s a random teleportation. Stop it!” The many gods quickly made their moves, using powerful divine force to form a golden sealing web. However, they were too late. The floating city completely vanished, leaving behind gods exchanging gazes.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>A while ago.</p>
 <p>Near the core power testing room, Rogero stared hard at the blue test tube in front of him, looking nervous.</p>
 <p>“The expectations that the Great Arcanist had for his successor are a little too much. Even as a high-ranked arcanist, it’s still too difficult to successfully brew the mild blue light potion. Thankfully, I have this…”</p>
 <p>Rogero placed a white crystal under the test tube, and in the moment that it made contact with the test tube, the crystal instantly heated up.</p>
 <p>“A stabilising potion that increase chances of success by 50%— The dream stone, Sage Abofeld! Success or failure shall be decided in this moment!”</p>
 <p>Rogero took a deep breath and placed another pipette at the mouth of the test tube.</p>
 <p>“If the potion turns blue, that means it’s a success. If not, it’s a failure… There’s only one step till I get the inheritance…”</p>
 <p>Rogero prayed the most devoutly he ever had in his whole life. “Whatever god you are, please bless me! If I can succeed this time, I will become your most pious follower…”</p>
 <p>It was unclear if a remote god had favoured him, or if this was luck.</p>
 <p>The moment after the pipette dripped a bit of the potion, the entire test tube began to boil.</p>
 <p>Thick liquid boiled and kept changing colour, till it stabilised to a faint blue.</p>
 <p>At the beginning, the blue was not stable, and Rogero could feel cold sweat beading on his forehead. However, the dream stone that that was like white crystal emitted white rays that enveloped the entire test tube.</p>
 <p>The mild blue potion stabilised, and he immediately looked elated, “It’s a success!”</p>
 <p>He quickly darted over to the crystal door with a large vertical pupil carved in and splashed the freshly-made mild blue light potion onto the eye.</p>
 <p>*Tss tss!*</p>
 <p>After the potion made contact with the eye, it was as if sponge met water as it was absorbed.</p>
 <p>Rogero looked nervous as he waited for the results, feeling uneasy and nervous.</p>
 <p>‘Beep! Brewing of mild blue light potion is successful!’</p>
 <p>Time seemed to pass slowly, but it also seemed to be mere seconds. When the robotic voice sounded, Rogero could not help but give a whoop of delight.</p>
 <p>*Rumble!*</p>
 <p>The eye rolled and produced the mechanical sound of unlocking. The large door slowly opened, revealing a path straight to the power room.</p>
 <p>“Haha… I’ve succeeded. I’ve succeeded!” Rogero roared in his excitement. “As expected, there aren’t many arcanists left around. That black-clothed person might be an arcanist, but his ranking can’t be higher than mine. I definitely was the one to pass the test first, so I’ll get full control…”</p>
 <p>While looking emotional, Rogero’s footsteps never slowed.</p>
 <p>The path was short. With his speed, he quickly reached the core power room and saw the Mise energy core that was continuously providing the floating city with strength, floating in the air.</p>
 <p>“Haha… as expected, I was the quickest!”</p>
 <p>Upon seeing that nobody was around, Rogero could not hold himself back and chuckled loudly.</p>
 <p>“Mine, mine! The ancient floating city, the remains of the Great Arcanist and all the arcanists’ treasures all mine and mine alone…”</p>
 <p>Rogero looked expectant as he headed to the Mise energy core.</p>
 <p>He looked moved and greedy as he reached his trembling right hand out.</p>
 <p>The fairy appeared nearby, watching on expressionlessly.</p>
 <p>“Intellectual core, hand over control to me!” Rogero shouted, “As the master, I’ll definitely treat you well…”</p>
 <p>*Beep!* The fairy nodded expressionlessly, and the flooring under the Mise energy core opened up to reveal something like a control desk. A purple crystal flickered with dazzling rays above.</p>
 <p>“Good job!”</p>
 <p>Rogero laughed heartily and his right hand reached forward.</p>
 <p>However, just a centimetre away from the purple crystal, something happened!</p>
 <p>Glaring rays surged and enveloped his body. These were spell rays from a teleportation spell formation.</p>
 <p>The high-ranked legendary arcane spell: Dimensional Banishment!</p>
 <p>“No! Mine… my everything…” Rogero looked unresigned as he vanished, leaving behind his voice that echoed in the empty secret room.</p>
 <p>“Aha… he took so long to get here. I waited so long…” A transparent human figure walked over from a corner of the secret room. The illusion on his body gradually disappeared. This was Leylin!</p>
 <p>He was now yawning, looking nonchalant. “He couldn’t even recognise the dimensional banishment trap. Ha, to think he was a high-ranked arcanist. Looks like there’s something wrong with his inheritance. I’m pretty sure it’s incomplete…</p>
 <p>“But even if he recognised it, the way to get rid of this legendary spell is for it to work once. He made me wait for so long…” Leylin looked dissatisfied.</p>
 <p>“Only a legendary Great Arcanist like you can detect the arcane spell trap that master set up!”</p>
 <p>The fairy now bowed low to Leylin, “While I’d already confirmed that only you, who is also a legendary Great Arcanist, can take over the city that is the glory of the Netheril era, I had to do this for procedure’s sake. Please be understanding…”</p>
 <p>“It’s nothing much… Proceed with the transferring of authority please. There might be more variables from the passing of time…”</p>
 <p>Leylin headed to the control desk. The dimensional banishment spell had now been completely removed.</p>
 <p>“The Mise energy core… Rumours have it that any item that touches it will be hit with something like a legendary disjunction spell and crumble into numerous particles. How powerful can this be?”</p>
 <p>Leylin sighed, right index finger touching the purple crystal.</p>
 <p>‘Beep! Confirmation of qualified person. Beginning transferring of control.’ The fairy cooperated with the operation. Leylin felt that his self linked with the entire city, and that it seemed to become part of his body, and he could even see scenes of the invaders.</p>
 <p>[Beep! Obtained control over floating city. Supplementary scan ongoing.]</p>
 <p>The A.I. Chip’s voice sounded. With its help, Leylin could easily control the floating city. In terms of his proficiency, he immediately reached the level of the original owner.</p>
 <p>“The energy reserves are at less than 50%, and there are also divine force undulations detected outside?”</p>
 <p>Leylin looked at the report and frowned slightly.</p>
 <p>“Fairy, begin preparations to teleport floating city. Activate concealing spell formations and spatial location confusion spell formations…”</p>
 <p>Leylin commanded.</p>
 <p>“Understood, master! The previous master always called me Shaylin, but you can call me something else…” The exquisite face of the fairy broke out in a smile and carried out his order.</p>
 <p>“Also, send me to these locations. I still need to take care of a few worms before teleporting…”</p>
 <p>Leylin waved his arms high spiritedly, but at this moment, his expression changed.</p>
 <p>A strange beast skin scroll automatically floated from his dimensional pouch. The seals that Leylin had put on had all cracked.</p>
 <p>The Mise energy core emitted terrifying energy undulations, creating a pillar of light the size of a thumb at the middle, shining on the scroll all of a sudden.</p>
 <p>The energy that could break up all matter did not cause the scroll to be damaged, but the luster on it grew more dazzling as it slowly opened up. It revealed an arcane spell model that was so complicated it was terrifying.</p>
 <p>[Beep! Discovered high-rank arcane spell model. To scan?] The A.I. Chip asked.</p>
 <p>“Yes!”</p>
 <p>With Leylin’s order, the A.I. Chip immediately scanned and recorded the model. After which, the scroll seemed to be done with its mission and rolled itself back.</p>
 <p>“As expected, this scroll isn’t something dead but contains some will of Distorted Shadow?”</p>
 <p>In Leylin’s tests, the scroll obviously sealed something amazing. If it were opened suddenly, it might result in terrifying contamination or curses.</p>
 <p>But now, under the radiation from the only Mise energy core in the continent, this seemed to be the correct way to open it. He had been given a terrifyingly complicated arcane spell model.</p>
 <p>“This…”</p>
 <p>Leylin took a look at the A.I. Chip’s taskbar. As the spell model was exceedingly large and difficult, the effects and abilities still needed time to be deciphered. The only thing Leylin could confirm was that this spell had a very high grade!</p>
 <p>“The price for all these arrangements and even giving me my bloodline ability is finally showing itself?”</p>
 <p>Leylin looked solemn, but his eyes were now full of bloodlust and violence all mixed together.</p>
 <p>“What are you standing there for? Teleport quickly!”</p>
 <p>Leylin yelled at the fairy who seemed to have been scared stupid.</p>
