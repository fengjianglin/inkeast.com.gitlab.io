 <p>“Have you decided, my Lord?” The black shadow couldn’t help but feel delighted in front of Faisal.</p>
 <p>The satisfaction in being able to threaten the leader of the Ouroboros Clan, one of the largest clans on the continent, was something that could not be described with mere words. It was only furthered by the conflicted expression on the other party.</p>
 <p>The rewards if he succeeded at this were so great he wouldn’t even dare to think of them before.</p>
 <p>“Reporting in, my Lord!”</p>
 <p>At this timing, a high-ranking Magus pushed opened the door. Ignoring the shadow’s existence, he began his report, “The operation was a success! We’ve captured seven traitors and killed twelve. The energy of the combined spell formation has been conserved, and we’ve only lost a mere 2.75%...”</p>
 <p>“What is this supposed to mean?” the envoy questioned, his voice growing deeper and gloomier.</p>
 <p>“What is this supposed to mean? It’s exactly what you think it is!” Faisal suddenly gave an empty smile as his body instantly appeared before the shadow, grabbing his neck and lifting him up.</p>
 <p>“If you do this, the Lords outside will definitely not let you off!” Surprisingly, even at this moment, the shadow was calm.</p>
 <p>“I’ll be waiting,” Faisal nodded his head as he said seriously, “If you think that I’m unable to deal with you just because you’re a spirit projection, you’re wrong. You’re very, very wrong.”</p>
 <p>The moment he finished speaking, there was a visible change in the expression on the blurred face of the black shadow and he couldn’t help but give a cold smile, “It’s a pity, but it’s too late!”</p>
 <p>*Boom!* Huge amounts of blue electricity rushed towards the shadow, blowing him to pieces.</p>
 <p>Faisal sighed. “With such a huge stream of disordered data rushing in, even the main body would have its sea of consciousness suffer irreversible damage!” he said in an unhurried manner.</p>
 <p>“My Lord, this is brilliant!” The Magus that had just entered immediately bowed.</p>
 <p>“This is nothing, it’s just a little scheme, and it definitely won’t affect the general situation,” Faisal said. He then exclaimed, “The Ouroboros Clan is my family and the pillar of support for all Warlocks of our Giant Kemoyin Serpent bloodline. I want to be in control of it, not let it be destroyed…”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>*Thump!*</p>
 <p>The green-haired Magus who was standing outside the city fumed upon listening to the grievous news as he witnessed the death of one of his envoys.</p>
 <p>“Release the Kyasha Beast immediately!”</p>
 <p>“But, my Lord…” Just as he was about to continue, the attendant at the green-haired Magus’ side was interrupted, “I know I have limited authority. I’ll explain things to the other Lords later, but for now, I want those ignorant Warlocks to pay with their deaths!”</p>
 <p>“Coo coo…” After the order of the release of the warbeast, the brave and blood-soaked Magi standing on the frontline heard a bizarre roar.</p>
 <p>The roar resembled the beating of a broken drum, and carried a heavy pant with it. It created a sense of oppression that made one feel like they were suffocating the moment it fell on their ears.</p>
 <p>*Thump!*</p>
 <p>*Thump!*</p>
 <p>The ground started to shake. How scary was it for only one creature to cause the entire city to shake with its mere footsteps?</p>
 <p>Faisal couldn’t help but feel uncomfortable in that moment, as he quickly ascended to the highest vantage point.</p>
 <p>From there, he saw an incomparably large creature, a four-legged beast with a horn on its head. The creature was so huge and tall that in order to avoid it, the enormous airships in the sky could only wave their flags and ascend further into the sky, opening a pathway for it to walk through.</p>
 <p>The earth rumbled under this creature’s arrival, its enormous aura even causing Faisal’s breathing to stop momentarily.</p>
 <p>When it finally stopped right outside the Ouroboros Clan headquarters, Faisal thought he was seeing a mountain range instead.</p>
 <p>The Kyasha Beasts roared in anger. A terrifying and violent wave of energy swept across the battlefield, causing everyone to lose their balance.</p>
 <p>“Morning Star! It is a Morning Star realm creature!” Faisal’s expression blanked out as he clenched his fists tightly. “I’m afraid the cleansing operation this time provoked the enemy so badly that he’s using the deadly weapons that were used in the last big war. .”</p>
 <p>On the other hand, the enemy who’d lifted the restriction on the warbeast didn’t feel too good about it either.</p>
 <p>“My Lord, is it okay to lift the restrictions now? After all, we haven’t performed final adjustments on it… Besides, a lot of our soldiers will be injured by it as collateral damage…” One of the Magi smiled bitterly as he looked at the giant Kyasha Beast with a heavy heart.</p>
 <p>This giant beast was absolutely not a natural creature. It was a precious experiment created by a Morning Star Magus.</p>
 <p>When the creature was not in use, it would be sealed in ice. The Morning Star Magus that created it even warned that if they didn’t provide enough food for the beast to eat, even a large troop of Magi would be eaten alive by it.</p>
 <p>Naturally, despite such shortcomings, a Morning Star realm creature had its own worth. This was a beast that had a physique at the Morning Star realm. Together with its enormous body and terrifying defence system which included the ability to heal itself, the idea of battling such a creature was a joke.</p>
 <p>Moreover, because its intelligence was sealed, even a rank 3 Magus could, albeit barely, control it. This resulted in a great increase in its worth.</p>
 <p>After feeling embarrassed and insulted by the other party, the green-haired Magus immediately lifted the restriction on the warbeast.</p>
 <p>The green-haired Magus, their leader, clapped his hands. “Don’t worry! The other Lords have given me the authority to lift the restrictions whenever I want to.”</p>
 <p>“After all, this is the last experiment. The warbeast summoned by the other party has to be at a Morning Star level to be able to defeat this creature. Since we’ve already made the first move, it’s up to the Ouroboros Clan to retaliate with their last resort.”</p>
 <p>The warbeast’s roars shook the earth as it moved closer to the defensive membrane on its long legs. A large number of Warlocks were eagerly showering it with any spells that they could throw.</p>
 <p>*Bang! Bang! Bang!*</p>
 <p>Blizzards, lightning, flames, and acids were all aimed at the Kyasha Beast. Yet, they were unable to so much as slow the rate of its advance.</p>
 <p>While a rank 3 spell occasionally broke through its defences, it was not enough to cause any significant damage in comparison to its enormous body. This left the Warlocks disappointed.</p>
 <p>By the time it reached the defensive barrier, the wounds on its body had been healing so quickly that it appeared to never have been wounded at all.</p>
 <p>The thought that this creature was invincible caused dismay among the Magi. Adding to the fact that it seemed impossible to wound the creature and they could only wait for their deaths, the Warlocks were extremely discouraged as they felt like the world was coming to an end.</p>
 <p>The enemy’s passion for battle increased greatly with the boost in morale brought by the warbeast. This further decreased the chance of the Ouroboros Clan winning the battle. The enemies depended on the strength and ability of the warbeast, it was able to kill all Warlocks standing in its way.</p>
 <p>“This won’t do. If this continues we might not even win against the enemy even if we use up all the energy within the Magus Towers…”</p>
 <p>Faisal’s expression became gloomier as he snarled into his own secret imprint, “Activating Kemoyin Gargoyles, I need all of you to authorise me to activate it!”</p>
 <p>“Agreed!” “Agreed!” “Agreed!” Immediately, Lucian and the rest could be heard as they brought out the runes specially designed for them.</p>
 <p>“Two-thirds of the council has agreed, Kemoyin Gargoyles activated,” a robotic voice announced.</p>
 <p>Following that, a large and powerful energy wave swept across the battlefield.</p>
 <p>The numerous Magi and Warlocks were stunned. The large Kemoyin Gargoyles that were always standing in front of headquarters as if mere decorations opened their eyes, a ferocious glint revealing the huge amber gemstones within. Beams of light were emitted from those eyes, heating up everything in their line of sight.</p>
 <p>The stone ‘skin’ on their bodies snapped off as if a huge jacket was being taken off. The statues grew rapidly, and within the blink of an eye had reached half the size of the warbeast.</p>
 <p>“Hiss….” The Giant Kemoyin Serpents hissed as energy waves at the peak of rank 3 erupted from them.</p>
 <p>“These two gargoyles that are peak rank 3 together have power equivalent to that of a Morning Star. Yet, this is not enough,” Faisal fumed, “Combine!”</p>
 <p>*Buzz!* On top of the headquarters, the main defensive spell formation shook as it released a wave of energy, drowning the two heads of the giant snakes.</p>
 <p>The two giant snakes hissed as they tangled with each other. A large layer of black light wrapped around their bodies, and when the creatures rose up as one, the body had reached the same standard as the warbeast.</p>
 <p>*Rumble!* The Kyasha Beast was no longer relaxed, and its eyes showed caution as it stared at the enemy that was just as strong as it.</p>
 <p>The huge two-headed snake in front hissed, and both heads spit out their scarlet tongues even as their amber eyes emitted rays of light.</p>
 <p>“It’s just like the rumours say. The “Duo Serpent Annihilator” is a capable puppet that has the power of a Morning Star. Indeed, this is the last resort of the Ouroboros Clan.” Freya looked at the double-headed black snake from afar as she showed a complex expression.</p>
 <p>This ultimate move was actually used on the first day of the battle. Did this mean that the reign of the Ouroboros Clan would end? Just like this?</p>
 <p>Freya and the other high ranking Warlocks suddenly had an ominous premonition.</p>
 <p>Despite facing an enemy that was far larger than itself, the Duo Serpent Annihilator took the initiative as it whipped its large tail at the Kyasha Beast.</p>
 <p>*Thud!* The large warbeast that looked like a mountain range was actually swept off the ground by the snake’s tail.</p>
 <p>*Rumble!* It was almost as if meteors were falling from the sky. The moment the huge body of the beast came into contact with the ground, it formed a depression and created a magnitude 8.0 earthquake.</p>
 <p>The allied armies that were unable to run fast enough were eventually squashed under the huge body of the Kyasha Beast, resulting in chaos.</p>
 <p>*Rumble* The warbeast that was stuck inside the hole roared, and a large amount of glittering light gathered on its horn.</p>
 <p>*Hiss!* The Duo Serpent Annihilator fearlessly fought the warbeast as it wrapped its long body all over it, layer after layer.</p>
