 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>An Unexpected Situation</strong></span></p>
 <p>“What happens after we enter the pocket dimension? Are we going to be working together or alone?” Leylin asked unhurriedly from the side, taking a bite of the roast meat.</p>
 <p>Kesha was gazing at Robin attentively. The reason she was here was due to the temptation of the precious materials in the pocket dimension. It was natural not to choose to work together.</p>
 <p>“You can do as you wish!” Robin answered without hesitation.</p>
 <p>“I have a general topographic map here, but it lacks a lot of information. Take a look!” Robin had evidently made preparations earlier and produced two maps, giving one each to Kesha and Leylin.</p>
 <p>“Of course, after we get everything, I hope we can discuss or perhaps exchange a few things. If anyone here plans to sell their precious materials, the other two shall have the preemptive right to purchase them!” Robin was very thoughtful, and since Kesha and Leylin had no issues with that, they both nodded.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>A snaking river flowed out from underground, the sound of surging water echoing throughout the cavity in this underground world, making it feel even more oppressive.</p>
 <p>In another area, not only were there powerful defensive spell formation set-ups and runes that glimmered, there were even Magi and beings of other races patrolling the area.</p>
 <p>Though these people looked pitiful wearing clothes filled with creases and patches, their auras were very powerful and wild.</p>
 <p>Leylin and his group all entered Shadow Stealth state and snuck in.</p>
 <p>Not far away from them, black bear humanoids—upright creatures with animal skins around their waists as well as other accessories—were standing guard.</p>
 <p>“Barbarian Bears!” This was the first time Leylin had seen such a creature.</p>
 <p>Unlike the half-beastmen who had escaped from the laboratories, Barbarian Bears were truly from another world. They were extremely intelligent, and their bodies were very resilient.</p>
 <p>An adult Barbarian Bears was comparable to a rank 1 Branded Swordsman or Bio Booster, as well as other sub-branches of ancient Magi. After awakening, the power of their totems, elder Barbarian Bears, and Barbarian Bear Shamans could gain the ability to obtain magic with offerings, and turn into frightening magicians.</p>
 <p>Just this tribe alone could take on the role as the kings in the Forgotten Land.</p>
 <p>In front of Leylin, there were no less than a hundred elite Barbarian Bear warriors, as well as numerous elders and Barbarian Bear Shamans.</p>
 <p>And their opponents were not limited to Barbarian Bears.</p>
 <p>A few short green creatures strolled past the Barbarian Bears patrol group, holding multi-colour staffs with different ores and gems embedded into them. These staffs emitted detection magic, which caused Leylin to back up.</p>
 <p>These green creatures were very similar to gnomes, though their larger heads were like watermelons, large and round. Their skin was a wretched green.</p>
 <p>These were the Green-skinned barbarian Magi. Favouring the ability to cast spells, they had abandoned the advantage of strength. Their spiritual force and magic power were terrifying. Every single one of them was akin to a human rank 2 Magus, and some even emanated the strength of rank 3.</p>
 <p>“What do we do?” Kesha’s voice travelled into Leylin’s ear.</p>
 <p>“Don’t act recklessly. Look!” Leylin pointed in another direction.</p>
 <p>At the side of the river, brown vines crawled all over a brown rock. It looked very normal, but this immediately attracted Robin and Kesha’s attention.</p>
 <p>“It’s an alarm spell pattern that targets hidden fluctuations in the air. It’s concealed very well. If not for Leylin’s warning, we’d all have been deceived!”</p>
 <p>Robin gritted his teeth, “Let’s withdraw first.”</p>
 <p>They exchanged glances and left the underground, while the other Black Horrall Warlocks followed closely behind.</p>
 <p>*Boom!* Once they got to another safe area, Robin’s expression darkened, and cracks appeared under his feet from his stomps.</p>
 <p>“Those wretched traitors to humanity! They must have set up those alarm spell patterns. If not, it’d be impossible for the Barbarian Bears and Green-skinned Barbarians to come up with this technique even if they had ten thousand more years to do so!”</p>
 <p>Robin walked in circles, evidently very annoyed. Within the Forgotten Land, besides the Barbarian Bears and Green-skinned Barbarians, there were organisations formed entirely out of fugitive human Magi. There had always been three main forces here.</p>
 <p>In order to protect this common asset of theirs that was the pocket dimension, they had obviously teamed up.</p>
 <p>“Didn’t we discuss this matter some time ago? Though this is the worst situation, we have made the required preparations. Relax, your emotional state does not seem too good.”</p>
 <p>Kesha watched Robin, whose eyes were turning red, and quickly warned, “Damn it. Leylin, Robin’s probably going to have another episode!”</p>
 <p>“Hm?” Upon hearing this, Leylin was stunned and turned to look at Robin’s bewitching handsome face. It was now distorted, and bloodlust was beginning to converge.</p>
 <p>This was obviously an effect of the emotional instability caused by his bloodline, resulting in Robin losing his senses.</p>
 <p>“Wake up! Robin, you might need it!” A high-grade potion of tranquility appeared in Leylin’s hands as he stared at Robin.</p>
 <p>Besides Noah and Kesha, the few other Black Horrall Snake Warlocks had retreated a distance.</p>
 <p>It was not out of fear of being hurt by accident, but because of the bloodline, Robin’s outburst might even affect their own bloodline and cause them to descend into a state of confusion.</p>
 <p>“No, I’ve had enough of that potion!” Robin’s eyes were gradually turning red, dense spiritual particles almost solidifying in front of him.</p>
 <p>“Has your uncle been having these episodes lately?” Leylin asked Noah while watching Robin.</p>
 <p>“No! It hasn’t been that long since the last episode. With the potion and suppression from the spell formations, it shouldn’t be happening again so soon…” Noah looked helpless.</p>
 <p>“What should we do? If he really goes crazy, he’ll definitely kill us!” Kesha stood beside Leylin, now evidently on the same side.</p>
 <p>“What else can be done? Hold him down and force him to calm down!”</p>
 <p>Leylin’s eyes turned amber, and a pair of vertical pupils produced a terrifying chill.</p>
 <p>After a few advancements, Leylin’s bloodline was even more concentrated, and the aura of the Giant Kemoyin Serpent had also risen.</p>
 <p>This feeling was most evident to Robin. He took several steps back, his expression alternating between mania and rationality.</p>
 <p>“Robin, we’re helping you!” At this moment, Kesha went forward, a powerful aura emanating from her body.</p>
 <p>The two of them worked together and evidently gave Robin a terrifying amount of pressure.</p>
 <p>At this moment, while he was breathing heavily, the rational expression stayed on his face longer.</p>
 <p>“You’re right.” Robin’s voice became coarse and thick, completely different from the gentility it held before.</p>
 <p>He produced a high-grade potion of tranquility from his spatial equipment and gulped it down.</p>
 <p>A bracelet formed using white crystals was glimmering with tiny white rays, producing a chill that spread in all directions.</p>
 <p>“Hah…” Robin let out a long breath, his expression becoming gentle.</p>
 <p>He took a look around, eyes clear and wise, “Many thanks, everyone. I’m better now!”</p>
 <p>“That’s great!” Noah cheered, while Kesha and Leylin looked like a weight had been lifted off their shoulders.</p>
 <p>If Robin really were to act up now, they would have to give up on the plan despite their unwillingness not to.</p>
 <p>“Robin, what’s going on? Why did it suddenly happen?” Kesha expressed her disapproval towards Robin.</p>
 <p>“My apologies! The outburst of emotion was to sudden, and I could not control it at all…” Robin laughed wryly.</p>
 <p>The defect of emotional instability caused by the bloodline had always been an issue for Warlocks. Even with all types of suppression potions and spell formations, they could only ease the issue, not cure it.</p>
 <p>This was why Leylin’s potions of tranquility were in such high demand.</p>
 <p>‘With Robin’s strength and thoughts, he shouldn’t be stirred up so easily and invoke the emotions from his bloodline. Looks like there’s something he must have from the pocket dimension, which caused him to be so irritated and be made susceptible to those emotions…’ Leylin rationalized.</p>
 <p>Compared to other high-ranked Warlocks, he had used the breath of the Icy Jade Scorpion Emperor to treat his bloodline in Twilight Zone. That was why he had experienced no episodes till now.</p>
 <p>Based on the A.I. Chip’s simulations and Leylin’s own calculations, he did not have to worry about this until he reached the Morning Star realm. Other Warlocks would not be so fortunate.</p>
 <p>Even a rank 3 Hydro Phase Warlock like Robin would often be affected by these emotions.</p>
 <p>As for Kesha? Leylin’s eyes swept past her, and he found at least three types of spell patterns that acted as alarms and bloodline-suppressors.</p>
 <p>“Alright, now we think about what happens at the end of the plan,” Leylin spoke, gathering Robin and Kesha’s attention.</p>
 <p>“Though we are now a distance away from the pocket dimension and have also especially set up a concealing spell formation, an outburst of aura like what just happened could be sensed by our opponents.</p>
 <p>“We need to decide on what to do as soon as possible.”</p>
 <p>Upon hearing this, Robin looked sorry and embarrassed. This whole situation was caused by him.</p>
 <p>Rank 3 Warlocks, merely by using their auras, could generate giant energy undulations, and it was unknown whether their setup was enough to conceal that.</p>
 <p>“It can’t be helped. We should enter stealthily, and if it doesn’t work, we barge in!” Robin gritted his head and made his choice.</p>
 <p>“Now that they might have discovered the undulations and are coming here, we should just head straight to the entrance of the pocket dimension. As I am the reason for the delay, I will place myself at the back of the group and enter after all of you have done so.”</p>
 <p>Robin bowed slightly.</p>
 <p>At the rear, he would require much strength to face the crazed counter-attacks from other powers. Even Robin would find this difficult to bear, which made his sincerity clear.</p>
 <p>Hence, Leylin and Kesha immediately agreed to Robin’s suggestion.</p>
