 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>The Bloodline’s Transition</strong></span></p>
 <p>The five remaining tiny snakes issued cries of terror while struggling to escape Leylin’s reach.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Leylin opened his mouth and inhaled sharply.</p>
 <p>All five tiny snakes were all swallowed inside his stomach.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, the spell formations on the ground emitted black lights, engulfing the entire basement.</p>
 <p>Wrapped in darkness, Leylin had a feeling like he returned to his mother's womb— serene and comfortable.</p>
 <p>Only the constant notifications from the A.I Chip could be heard.</p>
 <p>[A large amount of essential substances are entering the Host’s body, confirmed to be Dark energy particles, absorption in progress...]</p>
 <p>[Host absorption rate greatly enhanced under the effect of the Darkness rites, crystal utilisation increased!]</p>
 <p>[Absorption complete! Host’s elemental essence conversion greatly increased, currently 35%.]</p>
 <p>*Di!*</p>
 <p>A crisp tone sounded in the centre of the formation. Following which, the black light converged into the shadow of a figure at the centre.</p>
 <p>“Huff…”</p>
 <p>Leylin gradually opened his eyes, and a flash of black light streaked past his eyes.</p>
 <p>“This feeling…”</p>
 <p>Having the elemental essence conversion increase to 35% so quickly was a strange sensation. Leylin could clearly feel that in the surrounding void, tiny black particles of the Darkness element were hovering around like fireflies.</p>
 <p>Although Leylin had a Darkness elemental aptitude, being able to sense the energy particles in the air this easily was still a first for him. It was a feeling of novelty. Moreover, Leylin could sense that it required less spiritual force than before to control the energy particles.</p>
 <p>“Latent Fireball!”</p>
 <p>Leylin quickly chanted the spell, and from the darkness of the basement, countless black fireballs flew out.</p>
 <p>Flames gathered in Leylin’s hands and became five times larger in an instant.</p>
 <p>Corrosive flames continuously formed and raised, and even the roof of the basement gradually turned red, seeming to be on the verge of melting.</p>
 <p>“A.I. Chip. Calculate the current stats!”</p>
 <p>Leylin muttered inwardly.</p>
 <p>[Rank 1 Magic: Latent Fireball. Degree of attack: 40.5. Additional damage from elemental essence conversion: 10.5!]</p>
 <p>“As expected! The might of the latent fireball has risen sharply compared to before, and the amount of spiritual energy and magic power needed has been decreased.”</p>
 <p>Leylin’s lips quirked in a slight smile.</p>
 <p>His elemental essence conversion had already reached 35%, which allowed him to have an increase in prowess when he cast Darkness spells. Moreover, as it was energy particles that were from his elemental affinity, the consumption of spiritual force and magic power was lowered too.</p>
 <p>“If my elemental essence conversion reaches 100%, I wonder what kind of extent will it reach…”</p>
 <p>There was an outward expression on Leylin’s eyes.</p>
 <p>Right now, his elemental essence conversion was only at 35% and it had brought him this many benefits. If he was a fully converted elemental Magus, then he could rival the existences of those ancient elemental beasts!</p>
 <p>Of course, Leylin was clear deep down that humans were, after all, not elemental creatures, so the possibility of 100% elemental essence conversion was minimal at best.</p>
 <p>To some Magi, as long as they reached 80% elemental essence conversion, they could attempt to advance to a rank 2 Magus.</p>
 <p>As for those with 90% elemental essence conversion and above, they were the geniuses that were groomed by powerful guilds.</p>
 <p>“100% is an unreasonable goal. However, with so many good conditions that I possess, I must have at least a 90% elemental essence conversion before I advance to rank 2!”</p>
 <p>The studier the foundations were built, the more benefits one could reap after advancement in the future. This logic had been long since comprehended by Leylin back when he was an acolyte.</p>
 <p>“Crystallised energy particles! I need large amounts of crystallised Darkness energy particles!”</p>
 <p>His eyes were blazing with a fiery passion.</p>
 <p>After waiting for a few minutes, Leylin went to the spiral staircase in the basement.</p>
 <p>“A.I. Chip! Check my current stats, and see if there are any residual effects or injuries on my body. Calculate the amount of time needed before I can use the energy particles again!”</p>
 <p>A flash of blue light appeared in front of Leylin.</p>
 <p>[Leylin Farlier, Rank 1 Warlock. Bloodline: Giant Kemoyin Serpent. Strength: 7.1, Agility: 6.7, Vitality: 8.5, Spiritual force: 29.8, Magic power: 29 (magic power is in synchronisation with spiritual force). Status: Healthy]</p>
 <p>Based on the stats that A.I. Chip had calculated, after using the crystals, not only had Leylin’s elemental essence conversion rapidly increased to 35%, his spiritual force had also risen.</p>
 <p>[Residual substances have appeared in Host’s body, determined to be elemental impurities! Currently in the process of expelling impurities from the body. Estimated time needed: 4 Months, 21 Days!”</p>
 <p>The results that the A.I. Chip gave left Leylin somewhat shocked.</p>
 <p>Magi who used external resources to advance would often cause themselves some problems. He had known this since long ago. However, he didn’t think that the damages would have been this much lesser than expected.</p>
 <p>“This can’t be correct! According to the meditation technique and the Book of Giant Serpent, after using the crystals, the backlash will only be the invasion of negative energy and a temporary loss in ability to sense the energy particles in the surroundings?”</p>
 <p>Leylin was somewhat puzzled. If using such crystals had such a good outcome, then the price should have been several times higher.</p>
 <p>The reason for the circumstances that happened to him most likely stemmed from his own body.</p>
 <p>“A.I. Chip, find out the reason why!”</p>
 <p>Leylin could tell that this probably had to do with his Warlock bloodline. Ever since his body had taken in the ancient blood of the Giant Kemoyin Serpent, his body had been continuously merging with the blood, also transforming his physique.</p>
 <p>The change in his body when he advanced into a Rank 1 Warlock had been minimal. There was also still a large amount of blood that was constantly merging with his body, which unknowingly gave him many benefits.</p>
 <p>[Mission establishing, obtaining authorisation! Beginning microscopic analysis. Scanning in progress!]</p>
 <p>The A.I. Chip quickly cast a light blue diagram in front of Leylin.</p>
 <p>It was a diagram of a human’s DNA helix structure.</p>
 <p>The difference between him and regular humans was that on Leylin’s diagram, there were many barbs on his helixes. These barbs vaguely formed the shape of a mysterious rune.</p>
 <p>This rune was somewhat similar to the rune that Leylin saw while transplanting the bloodline. Furthermore, it seemed to expand continuously, as if wanted to cover the entire model of Leylin’s DNA.</p>
 <p>[Abnormality in genetic information found in Host’s body. Endocrine secretion is different from normal humans. Cell activity increased, increasing effect of expelling poison!]</p>
 <p>At the bottom of the diagram, the A.I. Chip came up with a conclusion.</p>
 <p>From the A.I. Chip’s conclusion, it could be seen that upon receiving the bloodline, Leylin’s body was constantly getting stronger. His body’s ability to expel poison had also exceeded most rank 1 Magi, to the point that it was able to dispel the residual impurities caused by the usage of the crystals.</p>
 <p>[Beep! Based on analysis of the Host’s DNA, the Giant Kemoyin Serpent’s bloodline is getting stronger, and will soon undergo a transition. Estimated time: 1 Year, 09 Months.]</p>
 <p>The A.I. Chip prompted Leylin with another frame.</p>
 <p>“Bloodline transition?”</p>
 <p>Leylin suddenly thought back to the records in the Book of Giant Serpent.</p>
 <p>If a Warlock’s bloodline was extremely concentrated, and if the level of the bloodline exceeded that of the Warlock by a large margin, the power of the bloodline would remain stagnant within the Warlock’s body, and accumulate until it underwent a transition!</p>
 <p>For every transition in the bloodline, the Warlock’s body would undergo a drastic change!</p>
 <p>What Leylin had transplanted was the purified bloodline of the ancient creature, the Giant Kemoyin Serpent. If one were to quantify its level, it would be at least a rank 4 Morning Star Magus.</p>
 <p>As for Leylin, he was only a rank 1 Magus as of now! The concentration of the bloodline was too high, so it could only be dormant within his body. After Leylin’s elemental essence conversion and spiritual force had reached a certain threshold, it would then enhance him with a deeper harmonization.</p>
 <p>“It seems that the ancient creatures’ bloodlines are mysterious yet powerful, which far exceeds my expectations!”</p>
 <p>Leylin who was walking up suddenly halted.</p>
 <p>“There’s still 1 year and 9 months huh?”</p>
 <p>The second transition would bring immense benefits to Leylin. The most obvious change would be the leap in power!</p>
 <p>“If that is the case, a lot of my plans from before should now be modified!”</p>
 <p>Leylin’s eyes flashed, “A.I. Chip, are there any methods to hasten the arrival of the second transition?”</p>
 <p>[Mission established! Searching within the database!]</p>
 <p>The A.I. Chip quickly began to compute. [Lacking in data, unable to proceed! Beginning simulation!]</p>
 <p>[Possible methods — 1: Using Bloodline Crystals. 2: Obtaining a spell formation that can strengthen the bloodline…]</p>
 <p>That was also one of the benefits of the A.I. Chip being upgraded. When important data was missing, it could establish conjectures, and provide a case scenario with the highest rate of success to the Host.</p>
 <p>“Weren’t these two items already extinct within the south coast years ago?”</p>
 <p>Leylin was somewhat speechless, “Is my only option to wait this out?”</p>
 <p>After walking to the top of the spiral staircase, Leylin opened a wooden door that had a metal hoop and came to the study room of the villa.</p>
 <p>“It seems that I have to look for some servants and the like!”</p>
 <p>Leylin sized up the empty villa.</p>
 <p>There were multiple rooms here, as well as a professional kitchen and stable. By the looks of it, these had been prepared for a Magus’ servants.</p>
 <p>After most Magi advanced, they would usually find themselves a few servants or followers, and some might even accept apprentices to service them.</p>
 <p>It was a very rare situation for Magi who had advanced to still live alone, as Leylin did.</p>
 <p>“I guess I should make changes to the original plan!”</p>
 <p>Leylin looked around the villa. “It’s a good opportunity to stay here for a while and take care of matters such as getting servants.”</p>
 <p>Originally, Leylin had been planning to undergo a series of expeditions to acquire resources for his advancement after settling down in the Nightless City.</p>
 <p>However, from the looks of it, since he already knew that his strength would be greatly boosted in 2 years’ time, he could afford to give it some time and wait it out.</p>
 <p>For Magi, two years were not a very long period of time. As for Leylin, who had the bloodline of an ancient creature, his lifespan was higher than most Magi.</p>
 <p>“Since I have decided to stay in Nightless City for a while, I should not be idling around. I have to create potions for sale and join other guilds to obtain protection and high-grade information. These can all be carried out at the same time!”</p>
 <p>Thoughts ran through Leylin’s mind as he suddenly remembered his neighbour, the red-haired geezer.</p>
 <p>This neighbour of his would definitely be helpful in this area.</p>
