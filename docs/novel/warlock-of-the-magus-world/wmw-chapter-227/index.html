 <p>“Number 2! Number 3!”</p>
 <p>Leylin shouted.</p>
 <p>“Master!” Two Branded Swordsmen wearing heavy armour immediately came and knelt down in front of Leylin.</p>
 <p>“I’m activating all concealment and defence spell formations. You are to stand guard outside and not let any living being come inside.”</p>
 <p>Leylin instructed. The two spirit-branded slaves nodded, keeping a strict vigil outside.</p>
 <p>These two Branded Swordsmen were controlled by Leylin through spirit branding. Even if asked to die, they would do so with no qualms and were the best people to guard Leylin.</p>
 <p>[Counting down: 8, 7, 6…] The A.I. Chip’s voice became softer.</p>
 <p>All that Leylin needed to do now was to snap his fingers, and a ring of a spell formation suddenly emerged from his surroundings, protecting the area.</p>
 <p>After doing all this, Leylin closed his eyes and submerged himself in the green liquid.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Time flowed by.</p>
 <p>Ten days later, in this little cave, in the middle of the spell formation, dense Dark elemental energy particles were mixed with flaming-red Fire elemental energy particles and they filled the entire pool.</p>
 <p>These elemental energy particles were so dense that they were immediately apparent in the external world; different colours were visible on the rock wall around him due to the reflection of light on these elemental particles.</p>
 <p>At the heart of the elemental energy particles, black and red vapour converged, seemingly about to crystallize.</p>
 <p>In the pool, the original green liquid had completely disappeared, revealing a dried up bottom.</p>
 <p>A large black cocoon lay still at the centre of the bottom of the pool, constantly expanding and then shrinking back, just as if it was breathing.</p>
 <p>While the black cocoon was ‘breathing’, the Dark and Fire elemental energy particles were continuously being pulled inside it with each ‘inhalation’.</p>
 <p>The black light became increasingly thin, till at the end, the hint of a perfect human figure could be seen.</p>
 <p>”Tsss!”</p>
 <p>A long hissing sound was produced from within the cocoon.</p>
 <p>Shortly after, a huge gale engulfed the cave.</p>
 <p>The Dark and Fire elemental energy particles in the air seemed to have come across a black hole, and were dragged into the heart of the black cocoon.</p>
 <p>The black light around the cocoon became weaker, and then completely dissipated.</p>
 <p>“Hm?” Leylin blinked his eyes open.</p>
 <p>The moment he had completely awakened, he could feel as if there was a layer of something sticky on his body, and it was very uncomfortable.</p>
 <p>He lifted his right arm, and a layer of skin that was the colour of his skin peeled off like withered tree bark.</p>
 <p>”What’s this? Is this like imitating the molting of the snake species?”</p>
 <p>Leylin was a little speechless and quickly tore off the dead skin.</p>
 <p>*Ka-cha! Ka-cha!*</p>
 <p>He efficiently removed the layer of dead skin covering his body. On the layer of the dead skin, there were even scaly resemblances similar to that of a snake’s skin.</p>
 <p>Leylin placed the skin aside and reassessed his body.</p>
 <p>Currently, there were no signs of injuries on his body. All his wounds had recovered, and his mental state was brimming with vitality. In general, his condition was great and better than before.</p>
 <p>Leylin stared at his hands.</p>
 <p>His palms were now even whiter and exquisite, and the pores seemed to have disappeared — it was like the skin of a newborn baby!</p>
 <p>However, Leylin could clearly sense that a hidden and monstrous power was flowing through his arms..</p>
 <p>*Ba-dump! Ba-dump!*</p>
 <p>His heart was pounding strongly, circulating blood and other nutritious substances all around his body. While his heart beat, Leylin could almost feel his body becoming stronger bit by bit.</p>
 <p>Though this was very slight, with the passing of time, the strength held in his body would be terrifying!</p>
 <p>“My body’s vitality has already become so powerful, but what about my spiritual force?”</p>
 <p>Leylin closed his eyes and began to feel the elemental energy particles in his sea of consciousness.</p>
 <p>In the sea of consciousness, the red rays were even more prominent, and the silvery-white threads of spiritual force were spiralling, seemingly very steady.</p>
 <p>“The total amount of spiritual force actually increased so much?”</p>
 <p>Leylin transferred a bit of the silver spiritual force to the external world.</p>
 <p>While maneuvering the spiritual force, he could feel himself extremely comfortable with this process. His body had adapted to the rapid increase in his spiritual force, and Leylin also knew that after this miraculous transformation, his spiritual force was slightly able to solidify. Within rank 1 Magi, the quality of his spiritual force was definitely one of the best.</p>
 <p>After he had made a thread of silver spiritual force probe out of his body, an astonishing scene appeared.</p>
 <p>Blackness! Numerous black lights appeared in the sky like fireflies, rushing towards Leylin’s spiritual force and clinging onto it.</p>
 <p>Leylin had never felt so comfortable in his life.</p>
 <p>Even without the use of the A.I. Chip, Leylin knew that the level of his elemental essence conversion had already reached a very high amount.</p>
 <p>“I was wrong! I got it all wrong!”</p>
 <p>Leylin was dazed for a second, and then laughed wryly.</p>
 <p>“The Giant Kemoyin Serpent was originally the child of the shadows, and the elemental essence conversion is just child’s play for it. Rather than exploring the strength of my bloodline, I persistently tried to use crystallised Dark elemental energy particles to break through the bottleneck. How stupid…”</p>
 <p>Fortunately, it was not too late. Using crystallised elemental energy particles only delayed Leylin’s second bloodline transition.</p>
 <p>Once he got more familiar with his body, Leylin commanded silently, “A.I. Chip! List the recent changes in my condition!”</p>
 <p>*Shua shua!* Rows of blue words emerged in front of Leylin.</p>
 <p>[Beep! Detected rapid liveliness in Host’s bloodline, the Kyerlis coefficient is: 44 — 46 — 56 — 78 — 89 — 101! The liveliness has reached the threshold and the Giant Kemoyin Serpent bloodline’s second transition begins!]</p>
 <p>[Beep! Host has gone into deep sleep. Commencement of reformation of Kemoyin’s Bloodline within body.]</p>
 <p>[Detected unknown composition in Host’s body! Permission to dispel substances… Countdown: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1!]</p>
 <p>[Beep! No authorization from Host, unable to dispel! Entering observation mode! Recording data…]</p>
 <p>[Beginning of alteration of heart. Rate of completion: 1%, 2%, 15%, 30%, 51%...]</p>
 <p>[Strengthening of Host’s bloodline. Innate spell, Kemoyin’s Scales strengthened!</p>
 <p>[Kemoyin’s Scales: Forms a layer of defensive scales on host’s body, has an instant effect. Physical defense: 35 degrees. Resistance to magic: 40 degrees. Consumption: 1 spiritual force, 1 magic power every 6 hours.]</p>
 <p>[Measured large rise in Host’s stats in multiple areas. Collecting data…]</p>
 <p>[Beep! Collection of data completed, converting into numerical values…]</p>
 <p>Leylin found his stats being refreshed.</p>
 <p>[Leylin Farlier. Rank 1 Warlock. Bloodline: Giant Kemoyin Serpent. Strength: 20.1, Agility: 13.4, Vitality: 25.7, Spiritual Force: 75.9, Magic Power: 75 (Magic Power is in synchronisation with Spiritual Force). Elemental essence conversion: 89%. Status: Heart remodelling, progress: 61%]</p>
 <p>The heart was an important organ that produced the blood of the Giant Kemoyin Serpent. Through the remodelling of the heart, ancient Warlocks obtained vitality and the ability to produce blood as powerful as that of the Kemoyin Serpent.</p>
 <p>With the scanning of the A.I. Chip, Leylin could clearly see a purplish red colour constantly extending from his heart.</p>
 <p>Wave after wave of power and blood was transported to all parts of his body.</p>
 <p>Along with the throbbing of his heart, the last few digits of the numbers that represented his spiritual force, vitality, elemental essence conversion constantly increased.</p>
 <p>“Even before my heart is completely remodelled, the rise in my stats is still increasing. How terrifying…”</p>
 <p>Leylin mumbled to himself.</p>
 <p>His current stats were comparable to a peak rank 1 Magus, and in terms of vitality, he exceeded them by a fairly large amount.</p>
 <p>He could feel a strength that he had never experienced!</p>
 <p>Pak! Leylin supported his weight with his hands, and a deep palm print was indented onto the rock at the bottom of the pool.</p>
 <p>His entire body bounced, and he jumped out of the pool.</p>
 <p>*Peng peng!*</p>
 <p>Under his feet, fine cracks in the rock extended like spider webs.</p>
 <p>“After the increase in my vitality, the density of my body has also increased. I’ll need to train again so that I can control the strength I now possess.”</p>
 <p>Seeing the damage he had unwittingly caused, he smiled wryly.</p>
 <p>He found a random piece of black clothing in his bag and wore it, and then snapped his fingers.</p>
 <p>*Weng weng!*</p>
 <p>The defense spell formation around ceased operation and two black figures arrived like a hurricane. They knelt before Leylin and said, “Master!”</p>
 <p>“In the time I’ve been asleep, has there been any strange happenings?” Leylin asked indifferently.</p>
 <p>Number 2 and Number 3 shared a glance, and Number 2 took the initiative and held out a pendant that looked like a book.</p>
 <p>“In the time that Master has been asleep, everything has been quiet. The five specimens are still unconscious, though Master’s secret imprint has been flashing constantly. Without Master’s approval, we did not dare answer…”</p>
 <p>“Oh?”</p>
 <p>Leylin took the pendant and flipped to a page with an imprint with a strange smile on it. Under the smiling face, there were rows of communication requests, but since Leylin had been in the process of transitioning his bloodline, he naturally did not bother answering them.</p>
 <p>He tapped on the smiling face, and string of Dark elemental energy particles shimmered.</p>
 <p>“Tsss…” Similar to the static in radios due to bad signals a noise sounded, and the voice of the old man in Leylin’s team could be heard.</p>
 <p>“My lord, is that you? Please forgive me. Due to the issue of signals in the secret plane, I can only contact you through the headquarters’ signal tower.”</p>
 <p>“Cut the nonsense. What do you need?” Leylin asked.</p>
 <p>“My lord… In the time you have not been around, our Hunting Zone 3 was was attacked by a peak rank 1 Magus by the name of Marb. He was like a mad dog, and as long as someone appeared in front of him, whether an acolyte or an official Magus, they would be killed. He even announced your name and said that if you did not appear, this situation would continue… Bat and Crow have already died in his hands…”</p>
