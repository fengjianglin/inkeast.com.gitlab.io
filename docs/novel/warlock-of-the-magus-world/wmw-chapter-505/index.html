 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Great War of the Morning Stars</strong></span></p>
 <p>‘Although the data paints a similar picture, the magnificent beauty of the edge of the world can’t ever be fully described by mere words and pictures…’</p>
 <p>Leylin sighed faintly. Currently, he was in a mysterious space surrounded by darkness. Multiple silver rays of lights streaked across among the stars, and it was like the universe in his previous life, boundless and magnificent.</p>
 <p>Cyril sat opposite him with gloom clouding his face. Subtle chaotic flows of turbulence struck him, but were rebounded by the layer of soul force on his body, unable to cause even the slightest of injuries.</p>
 <p>All Morning Star Magi possessed the ability to survive in the crevices of space. They relied on it to pass through the different worlds.</p>
 <p>Of course, it also depended on the grade of the crevices.</p>
 <p>The one that Leylin chose was situated at the edge of the world. The space there was comparatively stable, and the slight spatial turbulence could easily be held off by one’s soul force.</p>
 <p>If, by any chance, the space encountered violent turbulence similar to that caused by ancient battles, or due to the wild and violent storms occurring within the crevices of two worlds, leave alone Morning Star Magi, even Radiant Moon Magi were likely to succumb to the force, leaving just ashes. The Scorpion Man from the Icy World had met his death in that exact same manner.</p>
 <p>Clashes between Morning Star Magi caused extensive damage. A battle between two could destroy the entire continent. As such, if any Morning Star Magi desired to take revenge, they would choose to settle scores inside these spatial crevices instead.</p>
 <p>No matter how extensive the damage was, it would not affect the stability of the world.</p>
 <p>The venue of the big battle this time was the Ouroboros Clan headquarters at Phosphorescence Swamp. If their clash had occurred there, regardless of the outcome Freya, Parker, and the rest would certainly meet death. In fact, the entire Ouroboros Swamp could cease to exist.</p>
 <p>Leylin definitely would not want that to happen. Hence, he voluntarily dragged the opposite party here.</p>
 <p>“You’re good!” Cyril raised his eyebrows in rage, traces of blue current circulating between them.</p>
 <p>He felt insulted at being outschemed by a junior. Even though he didn’t want to be criticised by the other Morning Star Magi for starting a battle in the main world, he felt he was entitled to choose another location as the battleground instead of being forced here by the opposite party.</p>
 <p>“Cyril! This and he matter at the Forgotten Land, let’s settle everything today!” Leylin’s voice was soft yet strangely firm. He had not let go of his grudge from when he’d almost been killed in a single blow and was forced to take refuge in the main headquarters for over a century.</p>
 <p>He’d shelved the idea of revenge then due to lacking power, but now the time had come.</p>
 <p>“How dare you bring up the past?!” Cyril fumed as he recounted the interference of these fellows who took away a portion of the gains. If not for them, the natural resources at the Forgotten Land and the Quicksand Organization would have all been his.</p>
 <p>He had also been suppressed by the three Morning Star Warlocks and been left with no possible means of escape.</p>
 <p>“You have to account for your teacher’s sins too!” Cyril’s silver pupils shone with a sharp icy chill. A long black pike appeared in his hand.</p>
 <p>Faint, yet audible demonic cries were sounding out from its tip, chilling to the bone.</p>
 <p>“You’re a brat who just advanced to rank 4, just how much do you understand about the abilities of the Morning Star realm? Prepare to accept your fate of failure!”</p>
 <p>Cyril’s growl was steely, ”Rank 4 spell— Demon’s Wail!”</p>
 <p>He tossed out the pike from his hand. *Boom!* The horrific scene was like history repeating itself, when the legendary giant Argyle threw the ahlspiess that destroyed the sun and killed the Sun’s child!</p>
 <p>Violent waves of torrential power descended, and the black pike transformed itself into a ray of black lightning, streaking through the turbulent space before arriving at Leylin.</p>
 <p>Powered by a Morning Star Magus’ soul force, the results of the spell were earth-shattering!</p>
 <p>“Demon Hunter Cyril, you are indeed worthy of your name!” Leylin gasped in admiration, ”Unfortunately, I too am not as weak as you think!”</p>
 <p>He had prepared to advance to rank 4 for a long time. During this period, he had managed to acquire some badly damaged rank 4 spell models. With the A.I. Chip’s simulations, he had managed to repair the content, and skillfully grasp them.</p>
 <p>Besides, the numerous memories he’d inherited from his bloodline also net him a battle experience that was even marginally better than Cyril’s!</p>
 <p>The phantom of a Giant Kemoyin Serpent, with large amber eyes, smooth scales, and ferocious razor-sharp teeth hissed from behind Leylin.</p>
 <p>“Complying with the ancient contract, I call upon the power of the bloodline, serve me now and transform into a resolute shield…” Leylin spoke with a delicate yet intense tone, similar to the hissing of a giant snake, as he chanted awkward-sounding ancient incantations.</p>
 <p>With every syllable distinct and audible, Leylin chanted the incantations before the pike arrived, completing the spell’s preparations and causing everyone an eerie sensation of time disorder.</p>
 <p>“Bloodline Shield!”</p>
 <p>As if an existence from ancient times, a black-scaled shield that had ferocious Giant Kemoyin Serpent images portrayed on it appeared out of empty space. Crimson lightning still bounced across its surface.</p>
 <p>*Bang!*</p>
 <p>Like a clash between the sun and the moon, or the impact of a star hitting the earth, the long devilish spike that had transformed into black lightning suddenly bombarded the shield. Blood red and coal black tangled, and the explosive aftermath was horrifying.</p>
 <p>A huge spatial turbulence resembling the gushing of a tsunami struck from both sides. If it were the main world, one single wave could have left the entire Ouroboros Clan completely destroyed.</p>
 <p>“No– No way!” Cyril yelled hoarsely from afar. From the connection with his soul force, he clearly witnessed the crimson point on his pike fade to its original dull colour. The Giant Kemoyin Serpent on the shield seemed to have come to life as it opened its mouth and ruthlessly chomped the tip off the pike!</p>
 <p>The black pike cracked, and violently blew up.</p>
 <p>Space itself rumbled as the turbulence started wreaking havoc. It created enormous sharp rifts that even Leylin and Cyril had to avoid temporarily.</p>
 <p>“Shield Strike!” The huge shield collapsed like a mountain, taking aim at Cyril. With Leylin following closely behind, the attack was incomparably fierce.</p>
 <p>“No way! No way! No way!” Cutting a sorry figure, a defensive Cyril yelled despondently, ”You’re a newly promoted Warlock. Why…”</p>
 <p>He was clearly agonising over his situation. Leylin was not like a newly promoted Morning Star at all, being extremely familiar with battling in spatial rifts. His ability to handle difficulties even exceeded that of Gilbert and the rest!</p>
 <p>‘It looks like my inherited bloodline is indeed rare!’ Assessing his expression, Leylin understood his display of abilities had been too outstanding, even exceeding that of the three dukes.</p>
 <p>“The exceptional purity of my own bloodline must have meant that the bloodline inheritance I received is more complete. As for Mentor Gilbert and the rest, what they’d received was much weaker…”</p>
 <p>The inherited memories of a creature were always stored in its bloodline. Thus, if the descendant’s blood was pure, the arousal of the inherited memories would be greater, and the inheritance itself would be richer, resulting in more benefits.</p>
 <p>With the A.I. Chip having purified his bloodline and the Lamia fingerbone’s supplementation, Leylin could potentially be the best of the Kemoyin Warlocks!</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Leylin was clear about his fate and he had no intentions to be lax about it.</p>
 <p>*Crackle!* Multiple black scales appeared on his right hand, morphing into a sharp blade.</p>
 <p>The runes of the rank 4 Kemoyin Scales were even more simplistic and reflected only a minimal amount of light but still carried a uniquely daunting aura.</p>
 <p>*Swoosh!* A layer of menacing black light surfaced on the blade, and Leylin mercilessly cut across Cyril’s chest.</p>
 <p>The soul force from both sides came into contact. With Leylin’s formidable strength and the razor-sharp blade, he successfully broke through Cyril’s innate defence. The knife-like blade left a huge wound across his chest, and blood splashed everywhere. It left a hole so large even the organs could be seen within.</p>
 <p>“How… how can it be?” Cyril attempted to cover his chest while stumbling backwards, disbelief in his eyes.</p>
 <p>“How can I lose? And to a newly promoted junior?” Cyril yelled fiercely, his face distorting with anger. The poise he previously possessed evaporated, and the fury tinged his silver eyes blood red.</p>
 <p>“No! I have not lost! I have my last trump card!” Cyril suddenly looked up, his body filled with an extremely dangerous aura. ”Leylin Farlier! Today I will show you what it means to be a true rank 4 Morning Star Magus!”</p>
 <p>The halo of an innate spell appeared from his body before brightening.</p>
 <p>“Rank 1 innate spell— Anarchic Forcefield!”</p>
 <p>This was followed by the halo of his rank 2 spell…</p>
 <p>By the end, Cyril’s aura had risen to the maximum, and four unstable rings revolved around his body.</p>
 <p>This was the Morning Star Arcane Art! Forced to the edge by Leylin, Cyril he'd ended up brazenly using his final trump card!</p>
 <p>“The Morning Star’s final technique…” The corner of Leylin’s mouth curved up in a smile. His old memories of witnessing one being performed had been refreshed, and it came to life.</p>
 <p>“I have one too!” Restraining his smile, the brilliant red glow on Leylin’s body started twinkling.</p>
 <p>“First, the rank 1 innate spells— Kemoyin’s Scales! Petrifying Gaze!” A fine layer of black scales covered Leylin’s body entirely, and his pupils glowed amber.</p>
 <p>“Next up, the rank 2 innate spell— Toxic Bile!” A poison from the ancient times surfaced, swiftly surrounding him.</p>
 <p>“Then the rank 3 spell— Intimidating Gaze!” After his promotion to rank 4, the dignified aura exuded by Leylin’s body had grown even more terrifying. His body had rightfully regained the power and influence of the Giant Kemoyin Serpent itself. He now radiated the aura of an ancient first-rate predator.</p>
 <p>“Finally, the rank 4 innate spell— Bloodline Metamorphosis! Combining to form the ancient Morning Star Arcane Art— Kemoyin Serpent Transformation!”</p>
 <p>The point mass in Leylin’s sea of consciousness started rotating violently, with his and his soul force spurred him on. The four innate spells synchronised with each other, with an amplification that caused a horrifying change.</p>
