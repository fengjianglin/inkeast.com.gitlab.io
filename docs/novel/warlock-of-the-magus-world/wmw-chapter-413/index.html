 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>The Forgotten Land</strong></span></p>
 <p>”It looks like you’re extremely familiar with this material, Leylin. At the very least, you should’ve read up on something similar before!”</p>
 <p>Kesha first nodded her head, before smiling wryly, “Lamia Hair can nourish the Giant Kemoyin Serpent bloodline within our bodies. I won’t go into detail, but it’s useful enough to have others fight you for it. Nobody who has some will want to sell it! Moreover, it will be used up the moment someone discovers it. The reason I know of it is that Mentor Gilbert had obtained such a material when he was younger…”</p>
 <p>This was an eye-opener for Leylin. Given how much the Giant Kemoyin Serpent bloodline had deteriorated by now, the current generation’s bloodline could not be considered extremely pure. At the bottleneck before the Morning Star realm, the current bloodline in the Ouroboros Clan could only provide a tiny bit of help.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, once nourished, this bloodline would have been strengthened greatly. Not only could it allow weaker Warlocks to advance rapidly in rank, it would lay a solid foundation for their future breakthroughs.</p>
 <p>Perhaps this was the primary reason for Duke Gilbert’s successful advancement to the Morning Star realm.</p>
 <p>Leylin could only sigh, helpless. This type of top-notch material was not easy to acquire, and one required both sufficient strength and fortune to get their hands on it.</p>
 <p>At that very instant, Leylin noticed that Robin’s expression had warped. Leylin put it into memory before beaming and changing the topic.</p>
 <p>Leylin’s study in Onyx Castle.</p>
 <p>The banquet had already ended, and an attendant had currently led Robin here, opened the door and entered before retreating with a bow.</p>
 <p>Leylin was sitting on a couch, the glass in his hands filled with dark red wine that was rippling under the light.</p>
 <p>”The wine produced in this year is actually my personal collection! Does Senior Robin want a glass too?” Leylin swirled the wine in the glass.</p>
 <p>”Of course!” Robin sat down on another couch and picked one up for himself.</p>
 <p>After pouring a small amount, he swirled the wine as well, his face expressing his enjoyment. “Grape wine brewed during the harvest year! It’s a rare sight these days!”</p>
 <p>”Parker and the rest sent it over to me. Apparently, it was a tribute from some royals in the vicinity!” Leylin laughed. He was not interested in anything that was purely for enjoyment, and moved on to the main topic after some pleasantries.</p>
 <p>”When the matter of the Lamia Hair came up today, Senior, you seemed to have some thoughts about it?”</p>
 <p>”Mmm!” Robin squinted his eyes and deeply inhaled in the fragrance of the red wine.</p>
 <p>”Since senior was willing to come over, the information must be something that can be shared. Please state your conditions!”</p>
 <p>”Good, that’s the Leylin I know!” Robin praised before taking a sip. He continued, “ There is no price or the like, but I need you to keep what you hear today a secret. This information cannot be leaked!”</p>
 <p>”No problem, I swear upon the honor of my royal bloodline!” Leylin’s face was solemn as he made an oath.</p>
 <p>When two parties were at a certain level of strength, even casual agreements would be binding, let alone an oath like this. It made Robin smile.</p>
 <p>”I do have some clues about the Lamia Hair!” Before Leylin could inquire further, he continued, “I received information that in the Eastern region of the Forgotten Land, a pocket dimension was found!”</p>
 <p>”The Forgotten Land!” Leylin stroked his chin. The A.I Chip swiftly scoured the database for information related to the Forgotten Land.</p>
 <p>The damage output of a Morning Star Magus was immense. Their final techniques held power akin to nuclear bombs, and had the ability to wipe out countries. Thus, the central continent had signed a peace agreement that forbid the wanton usage of final techniques, restricting Morning Star Magi from using their full strength.</p>
 <p>Still, even with such a contract, some disputes escalated to the point that battle was inevitable. Clashes between Morning Star Magi still occurred, and devastated the land every single time.</p>
 <p>In Twilight Zone, two Morning Star Magi had inadvertently destroyed the passages linking it to the rest of the Magus world, isolating the place for thousands of years.</p>
 <p>Even in the much vaster central continent, with Morning Star, Radiant Moon and even Breaking Dawn Magi watching over, such battles would still cause a large amount of damage to the area.</p>
 <p>Moreover, some regions would be damaged to the extent that there was no return. All sentient species would go extinct, and elemental particles would start leaking whenever someone visited the area, causing the strength of a visiting Magus to drop greatly.</p>
 <p>Gradually, some of the affected areas became lands of death. Only strange species and convicts who could not mix with the rest would bear the hardships of the environment and settle down there.</p>
 <p>The Forgotten Land was one such place.</p>
 <p>Legend has it that in such vile conditions all the beings would strive to promote their strength, and evolve in a horrifying direction. Over time, they would form an extremely strange race, and the place would be fraught with dangers.</p>
 <p>“What pocket dimension?” Leylin asked, getting a bad premonition.</p>
 <p>Pocket dimensions were naturally not rare in the central continent, and the Ouroboros Clan itself had the powers to construct one themselves. Although the major powers of the central continent were focused on interdimensional travel, rank 2 and 3 Magi still built pocket dimensions.</p>
 <p>But the resources in the Forgotten Land were extremely poor normally. That a pocket dimension, a type of region known for being rich in resources, had appeared there would lead to a lot of competition and bloodshed.</p>
 <p>”The pocket dimension must have been damaged during the clash between Morning Star Magi. Due to its regenerative abilities, a small portion of it was preserved and was unearthed recently!”</p>
 <p>Robin placed the wineglass down, his face solemn yet tinged with greed.</p>
 <p>“Even though the subordinate who had discovered the mysterious region was under a very powerful curse, and died painfully immediately after handing me the intelligence, at least I obtained some information! If you would look at this!”</p>
 <p>Robin took out a black leaf. Once it appeared, Leylin felt the bloodline within his body throbbing. He suppressed the peculiar reactions of his body and took it.</p>
 <p>Even though it was an ordinary leaf with green veins, there was an aura lingering on its surface that caused his pupils to dilate.</p>
 <p>Even though the aura was very feeble, it could not in the very least conceal the strong essence behind it, and even caused Leylin to be fearful.</p>
 <p>”The aura of the Lamia! Legend has it that the Lamia could control giant serpents through spells, no wonder I feel uneasy!” Leylin sighed a long breath of relief: “Did this leaf come from the pocket dimension?”</p>
 <p>The ancient Lamia was a terrifying being at the Radiant Moon realm. Even though there were half-human half-snake species in the Magus world now, the ancient Lamia was an entirely different species!</p>
 <p>And only the threatening aura of the Lamia could make Leylin feel terrified.</p>
 <p>”Yes!” Robin nodded.</p>
 <p>”According to my intelligence, there is a huge pocket dimension there filled with resources. It belonged to a Warlock organisation of ancient times. As you know, as long as it’s a Warlock organisation, due to the bloodline limitations of Warlocks, they are the most passionate about collecting bloodlines to mix and modulate in their experiments. As a result, you will be able to find many materials Warlocks urgently need!”</p>
 <p>”I get it now. You wish to explore, but you don’t have sufficient manpower?” Leylin had understood Robin’s plans.</p>
 <p>Even though there was a certain level of danger, he was still prepared to journey there. The temptation of the hair of the Lamia, alongside many other bloodline resources, was sufficient to have him brave the danger.</p>
 <p>”Yes! Apart from you, I have also invited Kesha along!” Robin nodded his head.</p>
 <p>Even though they were all rank 3 Warlocks, the Kemoyin bloodline and the Black Horrall Snake bloodline had a very big difference.</p>
 <p>Under him, there was a younger generation of the Giant Kemoyin Serpent bloodline who had just advanced to rank 3, and the rest of his subordinates could at most act as assistants, and were not very useful.</p>
 <p>”Looks like there are more risks!” Leylin leaned back.</p>
 <p>As to why Robin did not invite Lucian who was at the Crystal Phase, or even directly reported it to Gilbert, Leylin did not need to think much to understand the reasons why.</p>
 <p>Robin himself was at the Hydro Phase, and with Kesha and Leylin at the Vapour Phase he could suppress them easily. If they were to call Lucian, how would they distribute the potential yield?</p>
 <p>And if he were to inform their Mentor, there might not be many resources left for him.</p>
 <p>Of course, Robin had made the decision after examining their strength. He had felt that if the three of them were to join forces, they would be able to obtain the resources in the mysterious region. Even if they were to meet obstacles they could not overcome or were not able to succeed eventually, there was still time to invite Lucian or Gilbert then.</p>
 <p>”I have no questions! When do we set off?” Leylin asked.</p>
 <p>”There’s no rush. I have to make preparations on my end as well. I need about 2 more months. After 3 months, let us gather at the headquarters and set off together!”</p>
 <p>Robin said the specific timing, and at the same time placed a document on the table. ”This is the intelligence regarding the Forgotten Land and the pocket dimension. You should have a look at it, and prepare yourself accordingly!”</p>
 <p>”Got it! See you 3 months later at the headquarters!” Leylin nodded, and got up to send Robin out of the study room. After which, he sat down and did not utter a word.</p>
 <p>The A.I Chip was swiftly scanning the documents Robin had left behind, and was carrying out comparisons and making deductions.</p>
 <p>”There are no problems with the data, looks like Robin is sincere!”</p>
 <p>Leylin stroked his chin.The data related to the Forbidden Land which Robin had provided was generally similar in content to the data the A.I Chip had collected, and was even more comprehensive and detailed.</p>
 <p>”Quicksand! What a weird name for an organisation. Is that a Warlock organisation?”</p>
 <p>Quicksand was the organisation that created the pocket dimension. Legend had is that it was a Warlock-based organisation, but it was unlike that of the Ouroboros Clan which only accepted Warlocks of the same bloodline. Instead, it was heterogeneous, and would accept Warlocks of any bloodline. As a result, the condition of the members was extremely complicated, and there were even some members with bloodlines that were only heard of in folklore!</p>
 <p>And this pocket dimension seemed to have been constructed by the Quicksand Organisation, as a place meant for experimentation on the modulation and combination of bloodlines.</p>
 <p>Of course, no matter how formidable Quicksand once was, it had disappeared in the ancient final war, and was now an abandoned mysterious region.</p>
 <p>But Leylin delved deeper into his thoughts.</p>
