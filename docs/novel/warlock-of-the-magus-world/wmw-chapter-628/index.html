 <p>“What prophecy?” Leylin’s spirits were lifted.</p>
 <p>“In this century, before the waves of extreme weather returns, the King of Bloodlines shall rise in splendour, crushing all the other thrones in the central continent!” Jeffrey’s body began to tremble with excitement.</p>
 <p>“A Monarch of bloodline Warlocks?” Leylin shook his head, “How could there be something so easy?”</p>
 <p>Wayde’s expression turned a little gloomy. “However, once a rank 6 Warlock does appear, they will surely exceed Breaking Dawn Magi in strength. Perhaps the Blazing Flame Monarch intended to nip the danger in the bud. This is also why the other Monarchs in the central continent are supporting it.”</p>
 <p>“That certainly makes sense as well!” Leylin stroked his chin.</p>
 <p>“And there are only a few candidates left that may fulfill the prophecy, one of them being Your Highness Leylin. Hence, for your safety and considering the futures of us Warlocks, we request that Your Highness stays in the Morning Star area as much as possible. Even if you wish to go out, please use some sort of clone…” Jeffrey said sincerely.</p>
 <p>“Why? Do you think I can advance to the Breaking Dawn realm?” Leylin’s heart stirred but his facial expression was that of stupefaction, “Even if my bloodline evolved to become that of a Kemoyin Emperor, I am still limited to rank 5!”</p>
 <p>“Of course, we are aware of the difficulty of bloodline shackles, but even a rank 5 Kemoyin Emperor will be one of our greatest military strengths…” Wayde pointed out meaningfully.</p>
 <p>‘This attitude… could it be that they really found a bloodline Warlock that can advance to rank 6?’ Seeing Wayde’s attitude, Leylin already had some ideas in his heart.</p>
 <p>“I’m naturally bound to do my duty for the Warlock Union. But there’s one problem. I still have to resolve the grudge between Jupiter’s Lightning and my Ouroboros Clan…” Leylin’s expression showed a hint of hesitation.</p>
 <p>“There’s no need for Your Highness to worry about that. Regarding this, there’s no need for Your Highness to worry at all. According to our intelligence, the chief of Jupiter’s Lightning, Night Phantom Zegna, is already dead…”</p>
 <p>Jeffrey sneaked a glance at Offa, before he made the report to Leylin.</p>
 <p>“What? Zegna has fallen?” This news immediately caused Leylin’s eyes to widen into full circles. He’d never expected that this enemy who’d caused him such tremendous stress before would just die so quietly.</p>
 <p>Although he was confident in killing the man on the spot with his current strength, his opponent meeting an end still left Leylin depressed. It was like he’d punched out with all his might just to hit cotton.</p>
 <p>“How did he die?” Morning Stars normally had lifespans of over a thousand years, and Radiant Moons usually lived to several thousand years old.</p>
 <p>Given how young Zegna was, his death was definitely not due to old age.</p>
 <p>“We don’t have any news about that, sadly. But we did receive information that Jupiter’s Lightning was taken over by a female Radiant Moon Magus after Zegna’s death. On top of that, they announced the end of all current diplomatic and military movements. This means your Ouroboros Clan’s emergency has been solved…”</p>
 <p>“Female Radiant Moon Magus?” For some unknown reason, Leylin immediately thought of the power hiding behind Zegna.</p>
 <p>During their previous fights, he had faintly sensed that Zegna certainly had assistance from a Magus who was more knowledgeable than him. This turn of events led to his instincts saying so even more</p>
 <p>‘Was it really an accidental death, or was it man-made?’ Leylin’s pupils twinkled in a myriad of colours.</p>
 <p>“As for the two Dukes, your wife, and any others, we can totally arrange for them to stay here to ensure their safety!” Wayne guaranteed, seemingly worried that Leylin still had other considerations.</p>
 <p>“Thank you so much Your Highness, but let’s wait until I finish everything on hand before visiting Freya and the others.” Leylin nodded in gratitude. He’d had some suspicions and concerns about the Warlock headquarters at this Morning Star area, but now it just seemed like they really wanted to protect a promising bloodline.</p>
 <p>Although most of his suspicions had been eliminated, Leylin would still run his own inspections before he’d make a decision.</p>
 <p>Leylin now more or less understood the peak military strength of the Warlock Union. The Morning Star area was their base camp, and of the executives among them, Jeffrey, Wayde, and Offa were all here. There was only one mysterious rank 5 Warlock hiding in the outside world, the last card in their hands.</p>
 <p>It could be said that the current Leylin was already at the peak of bloodline Warlocks, one of their five magnates. His position in this Morning Star area could no longer be described as just respected. He instead was a partial ruler!</p>
 <p>He’d even gotten access to some of the union’s resources, and the first thing he did was to enrich the A.I. Chip’s database with even more information.</p>
 <p>…...</p>
 <p>Morning Star area, in a castle specially built for Leylin.</p>
 <p>A few months had passed by in a flash. Now, Freya was putting the books in her hands down and stretched, caressing her stomach. Her face was brimming with joy and love.</p>
 <p>Passing through an astral gate, the two Kemoyin Dukes and Freya had seen Leylin in the Morning Star area. She couldn’t believe that her husband had advanced to rank 5, even upgrading his bloodline to that of the terrifying Kemoyin Emperor.</p>
 <p>Rank 5! This was a painful topic for all Kemoyin Warlocks, but now the bloodline of the Kemoyin Emperor was already growing in her womb.</p>
 <p>“Kemoyin Emperor, the ruler of all Kemoyin Warlocks…” Freya mumbled with blurred vision as her eyes brimmed with joy.</p>
 <p>This was the right and proper ruling bloodline, one that had a guarantee of being able to advance to rank 5! Freya had a premonition that the Farlier Family would become the royalty of the Ouroboros Clan. All of the female Kemoyin warlocks would go crazy in order to obtain Leylin’s bloodline, even resorting to unscrupulous ways!</p>
 <p>“With the injection of a rank 5 bloodline also has so many benefits for my Blood Serpent Family. Forget falling, our bloodline will definitely rise in rank now!” Thinking about how she’d successfully gained hold of these things that she wouldn’t have even been able to beg for before, Freya was filled with rejoicement.</p>
 <p>And with that admiration came a further increase in her admiration and trust towards her husband… Thinking up to this point, Freya couldn’t help but tilt her head to look in another direction.</p>
 <p>Outside the translucent glass, not far away from the master bedroom was a large laboratory for experiments on the astral plane as well as a breeding room for bloodlines. The two buildings stood tall like large monsters, even engulfing all the light in their surroundings as they made one feel stifled.</p>
 <p>Inside the bloodline experimentation lab, Leylin was looking at a body in the breeding pool, a thoughtful expression emerging on his face.</p>
 <p>[Constructing the clone’s body! Estimated to be a perfect body of a Morning Star!] The A.I. Chip’s scans and prompts were transmitted continuously.</p>
 <p>Leylin was currently trying to create a clone of himself. Generally speaking, such a clone would be a rank below that of the Magi who created it. In order to obtain a clone of a same rank as the main body like Wayde’s, one required not only time and large amounts of resources, but a certain amount of luck as well.</p>
 <p>“Beginning copying of soul imprint!” Two bright beams of light shot out of Leylin’s eyes and into the clone’s…</p>
 <p>Half an hour later, the clone’s eyelids suddenly raised, its eyes containing a slight vigour. Energy undulations at the peak of Morning Star began to spread out.</p>
 <p>“Based on the Heavenly Astrals’ blueprint and flesh that has been added to my own body, this clone’s battle prowess pretty decent in the Morning Star level!”</p>
 <p>Leylin nodded in satisfaction. Truth be told, such a clone wasn’t very useful. Although they worked when dealing with weak enemies, they were only bugs in front of Radiant Moons.</p>
 <p>However, its advantage lay in its simple structure. This type of clone was good cannon fodder that could handle some unimportant matters.</p>
 <p>[Based on the main body’s spiritual conditions, at most three imprints can be maintained at once!] the A.I. Chip’s voice echoed once more.</p>
 <p>“In other words, under normal circumstances, I can at most maintain 3 Morning Star ranked clones?” Leylin stroked his chin. He had a certain understanding towards the situation with this kind of clone.</p>
 <p>Because truesouls were inseparable, many Magi had clones like this that only possessed a spiritual imprint. Its death would not have much impact on the main body, but on the main body’s death, the truesoul could shift into the clone and successfully revive itself.</p>
 <p>Still, this process had its dangers as well. For instance, Leylin had taken a Radiant Moon Magus’ clones out with them, causing a thorough death by killing the truesoul itself.</p>
 <p>‘This kind of method is not very safe... Legends talk of a way during ancient times to break up one’s truesoul. A clone formed in that way unifies both sides, but they don’t necessarily affect one another. Even if one dies, the other can live on without a hitch. That is true cloning…’ Leylin thought of some confidential information he’d acquired before.</p>
 <p>‘Only, because one is breaking up their truesoul, such a cloning may result in different personalities because of the different environments and experiences. There could even be a situation wherein the clones turn against each other and become enemies. That’s too dangerous…’</p>
 <p>The technique he was using currently was like that of creating a photocopied substitute. Although it would not have any special abilities, it was better in terms of stability and safety. Of course, another reason for Leylin choosing this method was simply that he had no desire to break up his truesoul.</p>
 <p>All such cloning required was a great amount of material resources and a piece of memory he could duplicate by using the A.I. Chip. It could be considered a bargain.</p>
 <p>Thinking of this, Leylin could not help but take a look at his own status.</p>
 <p>[Leylin Farlier rank 5 bloodline: Kemoyin Serpent Emperor (Complete body), Strength: 76, Agility: 62, Vitality: 138.9, Spiritual force: 1329.7, Magic power: 1329 (Magic power is in synchronisation with spiritual force) Soul Force: 133 (New Moon)]</p>
