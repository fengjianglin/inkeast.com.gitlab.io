 <p>“Scan the stats of the Black Horrall Snake in front of me!”</p>
 <p>Leylin ordered once again.</p>
 <p>[Beep! Target stats: Strength: 18, Agility: 15, Vitality: 20, Spiritual force: 22.</p>
 <p>Abilities - 1. Scales Defence: The Black Horrall Snake rhombus scales has a defensive force field encircling it at all times. Immune to physical and magical attacks under 5 degrees. Moreover, it has a huge negation towards attack of 5 degrees and more. 2. Shadow Stealth: Inheriting the Kemoyin Serpent’s shadow powers allows the Black Horrall Snake to enter into a stealth state anytime, withdrawing all signs of energy waves. 3. Lightning blaze: Emits a lightning flame from the horn. Estimated degree of attack: 12 to 15 degrees. Status: Extremely weak!]</p>
 <p>“Stats like this…”</p>
 <p>Leylin’s eyes widened, “It has long since surpassed the boundaries of a level 3 acolyte, and is most likely close to that of an official Magus?”</p>
 <p>There were no records of the stats of official Magus in the A.I. Chip, so Leylin could only guess.</p>
 <p>“Roth, careful! This is a Black Horrall Snake! Its might is extremely higher, much higher than your imagination!”</p>
 <p>“Hisssssss!”</p>
 <p>Before Leylin had finished warning him, the Black Horrall Snake let out an ear-piercing hiss.</p>
 <p>The massive body of the Black Horrall Snake began to writhe and the tail was sent flailing. The cave seemed to shake.</p>
 <p>* Pa Pa! * The milky white tentacles broke constantly, and from its wounds, there was white dense pus.</p>
 <p>The triangular pupils of the Black Horrall Snake seemed to reveal a glint of ridicule. Following which, it turned back into the eyes of a beast and bit on Roth who had fallen to the ground.</p>
 <p>“Save him!”</p>
 <p>Shaya and Jayden roared, and a few green vines and silver flying knives was sent flying towards the Black Horrall Snake’s body.</p>
 <p>* Bang! * The flying knives and vines hit on the scales of the Black Horrall Snake, and sparks were created.</p>
 <p>The Black Horrall Snake did not budge at all and opened its bloody mouth, directly chomping on Roth, swallowing him with a gulp.</p>
 <p>“Oh, no!”</p>
 <p>On the neck of the giant snake, there was a bulge as if someone was attacking within.</p>
 <p>Very soon, the bulge entered the stomach of the snake and the struggle within grew smaller and smaller, finally turning still.</p>
 <p>The whole process took only a few seconds, so fast that Leylin and the others did not have time to rescue him.</p>
 <p>“Black Horrall Snake?”</p>
 <p>Bosain who was on the side recovered from the shock, “Isn't that an existence that, when matured, could deal with a rank 3 Magus? Why has it appeared here?”</p>
 <p>“It could go against a rank 3 Magus?”</p>
 <p>Jayden and the others jumped in shock! rank 3 Magus! That is the cultivation of the leader in the Lighthouse of the Night, a person who could suppress the 3 academies!</p>
 <p>“If it’s a rank 3 Magus, we would have long been dead, not even a speck left. Could it be that this Black Horrall Snake has not matured yet?” Leylin’s thoughts spun rapidly.</p>
 <p>“No! It’s not correct! This is a matured Black Horrall Snake. However, due to the duration that it has been sealed for and not being able to eat, it has already regressed from a rank 3 Magus into an elementary rank 1 Magus! Furthermore, it was awakened by the human boy earlier…”</p>
 <p>According to the indication from the A.I. Chip, Leylin guessed the truth.</p>
 <p>This Black Horrall Snake could be the byproduct of the great Magus Serholm before, and was left here according to his wishes.</p>
 <p>There was most likely no food in this secret plane, hence, the Black Horrall Snake could only hibernate to reduce the consumption needed for its body.</p>
 <p>However, hundreds and thousands of years have passed. Even if the Black Horrall Snake tried to conserve its strength, it could not have reversed the decomposition effect. From originally a creature which could go against a rank 3 Magus, it had now regressed to the standard of a rank 1 Magus.</p>
 <p>After swallowing Roth, Black Horrall Snake’s pupils showed a hint of satisfaction, before sizing up Leylin and the others.</p>
 <p>“It is still a young Black Horrall Snake, not even an official Magus. We still have a chance!”</p>
 <p>Leylin was afraid that Jayden and the rest would have been dismayed and lost their fighting spirit after hearing declare it as a ‘rank 3 Magus’, hence, he quickly shouted to boost their confidence.</p>
 <p>Leylin had the A.I. Chip and was able to tell the truth behind the regression of the snake. Such a thing had to be kept mum. In the short period of time Jayden and the rest wouldn't be able to discover it, so Leylin just simply told a lie in its place.</p>
 <p>“A fledgling?” Bosain’s eyes flashed. “Indeed! This Black Horrall Snake is too weak, even weaker than a rank 1 Magus. It is definitely in its pre-adolescent phase!”</p>
 <p>“This is a creature which could fight against rank 3 Magi in the future when it grows up! If I were to sign a contract with it…”</p>
 <p>Bosain muttered and his armour immediately flashed. A metal liquid was held in his right hand, turning into a silver white sword.</p>
 <p>“Come! The brutal Black Horrall Snake of the legends! Let me, Bosain, be your owner!”</p>
 <p>Bosain eyes were frenzied and he directly charged forward.</p>
 <p>* Bang! * The thin silver sword slashed at the Black Horrall Snake’s scales, creating a long gash. A few palm sized scales too dropped out.</p>
 <p>“Indeed, it if were a matured Black Horrall Snake, I would have no chances at all to break its defensive forcefield!”</p>
 <p>Bosain hollered, “This is mine! This Black Horrall Snake must definitely belong to me!”</p>
 <p>“Hisssssssss!” The Black Horrall Snake hissed angrily and flung its tail.</p>
 <p>* Bang! * As if it were a black lightning, the long tail viciously struck Bosain.</p>
 <p>Bosain seemed to fly out like a cannonball, creating a large hole in the walls of the cave.</p>
 <p>* Hua La La! * Mud and rocks fell down, revealing Bosain who was wearing his shining white armour.</p>
 <p>“Leylin, Jayden, and Shaya, help me to restrain it. Not only can you get the friendship of the Lilytell family, I am also willing to give up all of the rewards obtained during this exploration!”</p>
 <p>Bosain shook his head and finally recovered from the dizziness, seeking help from Leylin and the others.</p>
 <p>“No matter what, let us restrain this Black Horrall Snake first. If not, we won't have a chance to obtain anything!”</p>
 <p>Jayden spoke as he channeled a large amount of spiritual force and magic power into the green badge.</p>
 <p>Ripples of jade green colour continuously came from the badge.</p>
 <p>*Peng!* Countless jade green vines seemed to fill the cave as it tried to entangle the Black Horrall Snake.</p>
 <p>“Cloud of Afterlife!”</p>
 <p>Leylin too used his spell that he was proud of. A large murky green cloud immediately engulfed the Black Horrall Snake within, the corrosive sounds constantly emitting from within the mist.</p>
 <p>“Comb of Vengeful Spirit!” Shaya too took out her prized magic artifact.</p>
 <p>It had the appearance of a rather old wooden comb. Shaya immediately used it to comb her fire red beautiful hair.</p>
 <p>*Sssii!*! The fire red hair grew rapidly. In the blink of an eye, there was already a layer of hair on the ground. After which, the ground of the whole cave was dyed red.</p>
 <p>“It is actually a type of binding type magic artifact. Combined with Jayden’s green badge, it may really even restrain this Black Horrall Snake!”</p>
 <p>An expectant look flashed across Leylin’s eyes</p>
 <p>After the dark green Cloud of Afterlife had dissipated, it revealed the massive Black Horrall Snake’s figure within.</p>
 <p>The scales were still gleaming, as usual, only that in that large gash that Bosain had left on its body, the surrounding flesh had been corroded to a purple black state.</p>
 <p>The huge snake’s eyes seemed dispirited. Looking at it, it was evident that Leylin’s attack had some effect on it.</p>
 <p>“All together!” Jayden nodded his head towards Shaya. Countless green vines from midair wrapped around the Black Horrall Snake, even around its head.</p>
 <p>At the same time, the innumerable fire red hair on the ground was like steel net. Very soon it wrapped itself like a net, trapping the Black Horrall Snake within.</p>
 <p>*Bang!*</p>
 <p>The green vines and red hair continuously tightened, leaving circles after circles of red and green imprints on the Black Horrall Snake’s body.</p>
 <p>The huge snake lost its balance and fell to the ground, bringing up dust and rock shards.</p>
 <p>“Nice one!” Bosain praised them. His body in midair left several white afterimages.</p>
 <p>After a few jumps, he came to the top of the Black Horrall Snake’s head.</p>
 <p>“Little baby, you’re mine now!”</p>
 <p>A smug and zealous expression filled Bosain’s face. He immediately withdrew a scroll which emitted immense energy waves, directly at the Black Horrall Snake’s eyes.</p>
 <p>“This is... A sealing contract within a scroll!”</p>
 <p>From the A.I. Chip’s detection, it was a power magical object. On it, a contract formation was sealed within. It had to cost at least tens of thousands of magic crystals. Moreover, one may not be able to buy it even with money!</p>
 <p>This price has long since surpassed the price of many magical creatures for magicians.</p>
 <p>From this, one could see that only those large families which had been around for many years could possess many great items.</p>
 <p>Leylin looked at Bosain who was opening the scroll and his lips curled up.</p>
 <p>“A pity that it is such a powerful contract scroll. If it were used against a youngling of a powerful creature, there could still be a chance of success. However, this Black Horrall Snake’s spiritual force is not in such a lowered state….”</p>
 <p>Bosain who was without the A.I. Chip would naturally not think of this.</p>
 <p>At this moment, his face carried a fevered gaze. Coupled with his trembling hands, he chanted an incantation and ripped opened the magical scroll.</p>
 <p>*Bang!*</p>
 <p>An extremely radiant white light rose in front of Bosain and the black snake.</p>
 <p>The white continuously circulated, finally forming a strange magic formation. On it was laced with mysterious runes and magic characters.</p>
 <p>“An advanced contract spell formation! A.I. Chip, record!” Leylin immediately gave the order to the A.I. Chip.</p>
 <p>“Come! Become my contractual partner!”</p>
 <p>Bosain muttered. From the formation a green light appeared, directly entering the forehead of Bosain.</p>
 <p>As for the other flash of green light, it was sent towards the Black Horrall Snake, moreover directly imprinting itself on the large skull of the Black Horrall Snake.</p>
 <p>As if knowing that once it was bound to the contract and lose its freedom forever, the black snake thrashed continuously, resisting the entry of the green light.</p>
 <p>“Hurry! Faster!”</p>
 <p>Cold sweat the size of beans trickled down Bosain’s face, staring intently at the skull of the Black Horrall Snake.</p>
 <p>“My dream, my life, when I obtain this Black Horrall Snake…”</p>
 <p>Just when the green light had completely entered the Black Horrall Snake’s head, a strange sight occurred!</p>
