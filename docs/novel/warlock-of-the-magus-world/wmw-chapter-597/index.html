 <p>“Rescanning. Confirmed to be a Morning Star Magus!” As the spirit genie’s voice rang out, the person in charge was silenced. One instance could be considered a glitch, but what if it happened a second or third time?</p>
 <p>He watched the figure on the screen in disbelief, “What level is he at? Display his star grade!”</p>
 <p>The screen quickly changed, “Target is Leylin Farlier. Saved data: Four Stars.”</p>
 <p>“What a joke! Rescan him.” He was practically yelling at this point.</p>
 <p>*Swish!* An energy bar appeared, and the four star level was filled almost instantly. The meter arrived at five stars.</p>
 <p>“So it’s a peak Morning Star. It’s no wonder that he can contend with Lord Stuart. But don’t worry, he can’t hold on for long…”</p>
 <p>He sighed suddenly, but immediately after, the monitoring staff pulled him to look at the screen once more. In that moment, he practically turned to stone.</p>
 <p>On the screen, the meter filled up even the five star grade, and then burst through it!</p>
 <p>The screen glitched out and was restarted. The spirit genie then gave another evaluation.</p>
 <p>“A Morning Star at the Six Star grade! It’s a monster, a monster!” He collapsed feebly onto his chair.</p>
 <p>“My Lord! What do we do?” The staff watched the man in charge, hesitating to speak.</p>
 <p>“What else can we do? Activate the most powerful defences and ensure that their battle won’t affect any other regions. We can’t handle the other matters…” The man’s eyes rolled back as he lost consciousness.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Weyers was on the battlefield, and he slowly gained more clarity on Leylin’s strength.</p>
 <p>“This level of strength…” Weyers watched the giant phantom of a serpent soaring through the sky as it let loose terrifying sounds. He had become slightly dazed, “This is definitely stronger than a Five Star. Is he a legendary Six Star Morning Star?”</p>
 <p>There were only five normal ranks for Morning Stars. However, history always produced frightening geniuses that defied common sense. This was the Six Star grade! A Morning Star who could match up to a Radiant Moon!</p>
 <p>“He’s actually reached this level?” Weyers clutched his fists tightly, thinking about his pride at breaking through to Four Stars, and he suddenly flushed red. He wanted to find a place to hide in.</p>
 <p>*Swish! Swish!* Large numbers of elites rushed over, looking solemn and preparing for death.</p>
 <p>Platinum flames flashed, and Weyers stood in their way, “I’ll take over here. Step back for now.”</p>
 <p>Though he was envious, he still had to abide by their agreement. Weyers watched these guards and the Morning Star that arrived behind them in a lofty manner, and offered his greetings…</p>
 <p>*Boom!* A tremendous energy tornado split open, and a blackened Stuart was ruthlessly sent flying as he arrived beside Weyers.</p>
 <p>Leylin threw the Morning Star Magus to the ground, the black gas already completely removed from him.</p>
 <p>“It’s a Magus from Jupiter’s Lightning!” “The spirit undulations are correct as well. I’ve seen him once before, and those can’t be hidden!”</p>
 <p>Many Morning Stars looked at each other.</p>
 <p>“Everyone can see that Lord Leylin was merely attacking the Magus from the opposing organisation, Jupiter’s Lightning. Based on the decree of the Monarch of the Skies, our Sky City is to maintain a neutral stance,” Weyers stood up and spoke righteously.</p>
 <p>Many Morning Star Magi exchanged glances, and watched Leylin who did not back down despite his injuries. In the distance, Stuart looked exasperated as he maintained his silence.</p>
 <p>Leylin and Weyers glanced at each other, grinning. The outcome had been decided.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Information about this huge battle in Sky City spread like a storm.</p>
 <p>The Warlock Leylin took on a Radiant Moon Magus by himself, only suffering light injuries to capture a Morning Star Magus from the other party. His name spread far and wide, and Stuart had been delegated to a supporting role.</p>
 <p>The commotion grew further and further, dwarfing that over the Sage Appraisal.</p>
 <p>Now, Weyers watched on as a black airship left Sky City from a private port. A strange expression was on his face.</p>
 <p>The person leaving was naturally Leylin. Though he had successfully taken care of the Magus from Jupiter’s Lightning and humiliated Stuart, he had completely ruffled the feathers of Sky City.</p>
 <p>After all, he had ruthlessly attacked on of their esteemed elders in their own territory! If not for Weyers helping him control the situation, the Magi of Sky City might have just declared war against him.</p>
 <p>Weyers obviously did not go uncompensated for his help. They had discussed that part beforehand, which was the only reason Leylin was cocky enough to rush to the frontlines.</p>
 <p>Even then, knowing that he was garnering too much attention, Leylin did not dare stay in Sky City much longer. He accepted Weyers’ proposal and went through unofficial channels to be baptised by the Endowing Scepter, keeping a low profile along the way. With his vitality increased by about 20 points, he secretly left the area, not participating in the appraisal.</p>
 <p>As long as he obtained the profits, Leylin did not particularly care for such a title, and he tossed the conversation he’d had with the Monarch of the Skies to the back of his mind.</p>
 <p>Leylin looked at his stats.</p>
 <p>[Leylin Farlier. Rank 4 Warlock. Bloodline: Giant Kemoyin Serpent (complete form). Strength: 50, Agility: 45, Vitality: 94.9, Spiritual Force: 956.8, Magic Power: 956(Magic power is in synchronisation with spiritual force). Soul Force: 96 (Five Stars)]</p>
 <p>“My vitality increased by 20 points, which means my body is pretty much adapted to the increased soul force now. The Endowing Scepter was truly essential!”</p>
 <p>Leylin couldn’t help but mumble to himself as he recalled the scepter.</p>
 <p>He had realised during the baptism that the Endowing Scepter was the energy core of Sky City. If it was attacked, the entire city would fall to the ground, leading to a horrifying disaster.</p>
 <p>The Endowing Scepter was not an actual scepter, but instead a gigantic energy reaction furnace. Its refined looped structure was something Leylin admired, and he had the impulse to steal it and study it.</p>
 <p>Leylin suddenly came back to himself, a slight smile about his lips. “It’s about time they caught up to me.”</p>
 <p>*Rumble!* Immense energy undulations swept through the area, and the Colossal Serpent vanished in a puff of smoke. Leylin, who had been prepared, merely stood in mid-air while staring at Stuart who had suddenly appeared ahead of him.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Within Sky City, Weyers watched the direction Leylin had left in, and muttered to himself, “Though I agreed to help you take on the pressure from Sky City, you’ll need to deal with Stuart’s retaliation yourself!”</p>
 <p>His gaze was full of complicated feelings, “Leylin, I admit that you’re the biggest genius I’ve seen, to the point that you can tussle with a rank 5. However, the disparity between ranks is not something one can step across so easily…”</p>
 <p>In the battle before, Leylin had successfully captured the Morning Star Magus alive, but he had also paid the price of getting injured. Meanwhile, Stuart had been covered in dirt, but he had no real injuries.</p>
 <p>Now that he was away from Sky City, it was hard to tell the outcome if he was was caught.</p>
 <p>The most likely outcome was that, after an intense battle, Stuart would end up with serious injuries and Leylin would wind up dead.</p>
 <p>Insanity flashed in Weyers’ eyes, “There needs only be one true genius, and that will be me!”</p>
 <p>“Is he gone?” Flames flickered, and a Magus stood beside Weyers that looked similar to him. The Radiant Moon energy he gave off was even more terrifying than Stuart’s.</p>
 <p>He glanced at Weyers with a look of encouragement, “You did well this time! With Stuart dejected, our organisation can now make ourselves known in Sky City!”</p>
 <p>“Leylin’s already gone. I’ve also received news that Stuart has followed him!” Weyers’ voice held a trace of laughter. Weyers daring to oppose Stuart was not because he was a fool, but because someone else was backing him.</p>
 <p>“Weyers, do you know why His Majesty, the Monarch of the Skies, promised not to interfere in the battle between the Ouroboros Clan and Jupiter’s Lightning? A Radiant Moon isn’t nearly enough for His Majesty to do this…”</p>
 <p>The Radiant Moon looked serious as he spoke.</p>
 <p>“Could it be…” Weyers’ expression changed.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>“Leylin, you can’t run this time. I will return the humiliation you gave me today tenfold! No, a hundredfold!” Stuart’s voice was distorted, and his expression vicious.</p>
 <p>Though Leylin was powerful, his total strength could still not match up to his own. This was what he had depended on when he chased after Leylin. Besides, he had help today, and could absolutely kill Leylin here!</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Jupiter’s Lightning headquarters, in a Magus Tower.</p>
 <p>“Is it all prepared? It’s about to begin!”</p>
 <p>Observing the bubbling Pond of Lamentation, Zegna’s expression fluctuated as a female voice was heard.</p>
 <p>“This will consume 21% of the Pond of Lamentation’s energy reserves, and might even affect your transformation! Have you thought it through properly?”</p>
 <p>“I’ve thought it through enough. Do it!” Zegna’s voice was low.</p>
 <p>“Alright! Give me a portion of the control rights…”</p>
 <p>Mysterious, complicated incantations sounded in the secret room, and multiple black masks arose, disappearing into the void.</p>
 <p>“Hm?” Leylin, who was facing Stuart, had a change in expression.</p>
 <p>Large numbers of black masks suddenly surrounded his body, sticking onto his face.</p>
 <p>[Beep! Host has been inflicted with a curse. Vitality and soul force have weakened!] the A.I. Chip’s voice transmitted.</p>
 <p>“A curse? And it’s a long-distance ancient curse?” Leylin’s pupils shrank.</p>
 <p>“Haha… You’re fated to die here. I will extract your soul and torture you for a thousand years!” Stuart laughed madly before he charged forth.</p>
 <p>A terrifying rank 5 spell formed a snarling black monster that opened its large, ferocious mouth in Leylin’s direction.</p>
 <p>“Scarlet Earring!” Red light flashed from Leylin’s ears, and a crescent-shaped blade of scarlet light slashed out…</p>
