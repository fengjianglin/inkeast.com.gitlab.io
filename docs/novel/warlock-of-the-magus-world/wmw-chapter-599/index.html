 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Surging Waves Through The Continent</strong></span></p>
 <p>The Monarch of the Skies wrapped his city up in a strange energy barrier, and the tremors grew less violent.</p>
 <p>After the energy storm outside passed, Weyers looked at the sight not too far away from him, and suddenly cried out involuntarily, “The thunder layer of Akev! Where has the thunder layer of Akev gone to?”</p>
 <p>Below Sky City was originally a gigantic sea made of black thunderclouds. This was a natural skyscape that acted as the first defence of Sky City.</p>
 <p>Even Crystal Phase Magi would find it so difficult to pass through it was practically impossible.</p>
 <p>Now, however, the gigantic sea of black thunder clouds had disappeared, leaving only a fog formed of condensation.</p>
 <p>“Obviously, everything has been destroyed. Even the city itself has been reduced to this state…” The Radiant Moon Magus laughed wryly.</p>
 <p>Weyers recovered from his surprise and glanced at Sky City, which was now in ruins, and lowered his head as if in disappointment.</p>
 <p>Even if they had been protected by the Monarch of the Skies, which prevented the city from being destroyed completely, most of the buildings had been devastated by the firestorm. Even if the core hadn’t been destroyed, the losses were still hard to estimate.</p>
 <p>Even most of the gigantic floating island had been burnt to a crisp, and it seemed incomparably ugly.</p>
 <p>“Wha- What’s going on? Could Leylin have done this? How’s that possible?” Weyers’ eyes looked lost.</p>
 <p>“The peak of rank 6, a power that's already beginning to touch on the might of laws. That should be the ancient Sun’s Child’s ‘Sun Scorching Nirvana’!” The Radiant Moon Magus’ voice was solemn. “Leylin was somehow able to obtain the bloodline of the Sun’s Child, and he’s probably unrivalled in his knowledge on bloodline spells. To be able to recreate ancient attacks like this using a bloodline imprint…”</p>
 <p>“Leylin?” Weyers grew bitter. “Then Stuart…”</p>
 <p>“With Sky City in this state, how do you think he ended up?” The Radiant Moon sighed slightly, “We were still colleagues…”</p>
 <p>Seeing his colleague fall just like that, he wasn’t feeling that good.</p>
 <p>“Stuart went against my decree and took part in the battle between the Ouroboros Clan and Jupiter’s Lightning. I hereby declare his expulsion from Sky City!” An odd voice rang in Sky City.</p>
 <p>“It’s the Monarch of the Skies’ voice!” Weyers cried out involuntarily. “ “Even His Majesty isn’t willing to provoke Leylin?”</p>
 <p>Only now did he realise the disparity between Leylin and him, to the point that he felt utter despair...</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>*Rumble!* The void was shattered, and large amounts of golden-red flames surged into the area.</p>
 <p>‘What is that?’ Zegna had this one thought before he was swallowed up by the golden-red flames in an instant as he cried out sharply.</p>
 <p>The golden-red flames did not let anything slip by and began to wreak havoc on the surroundings. Even the Magus Tower of a rank 5 Radiant Moon Magus could do nothing against it.</p>
 <p>The faint sound of a woman’s piercing scream was sent out from Zegna’s arm.</p>
 <p>“Damn it, it’s the ancient Sun’s Child!”</p>
 <p>“Curse of ancient times, heed my command. Show me the wrath of time and space…” The woman’s voice quickly chanted.</p>
 <p>*Tss tss!* Accompanying the strange and terrifying incantations, the black gases in the Pond of Lamentation surged outside, tangling with the sun’s flames.</p>
 <p>Multiple distorted souls appeared in the air, forming a durable layer of light that disallowed the roasting flames entry.</p>
 <p>Once the storm passed, the black streams of gas from the Pond of Lamentation had decreased by a large amount, and all that was left of Zegna was a charred arm on the ground.</p>
 <p>*Whoosh!* The charred arm exploded, and flesh and blood began to grow at a rapid rate, forming Zegna once more.</p>
 <p>Now, however, his expression was terrible, and he had frightful burn marks on his body.</p>
 <p>“The ancient flames of the sun thankfully exploded a fair distance away from us, and through the and a great part of its might was reduced through the spacetime channel. If not, it wouldn’t be just you losing your life…” The mysterious woman’s voice sounded.</p>
 <p>“Damn it, DAMN IT! How did it come to this? Everything should have been smooth-sailing… Ugh…”</p>
 <p>Zegna roared in his fury, but suddenly, he stopped, as if his throat was being clutched. Little flames were beginning to burn on his body once more.</p>
 <p>“The Sun’s Child was at the peak of rank 6 Magi, and a being beginning to comprehend laws. Its flames hold within some of the power of law, and cannot be so easily taken care of!”</p>
 <p>A hint of helplessness could be heard in her voice. Large amounts of water from the Pond of Lamentation flew into the air, forming a black robe and draping over Zegna.</p>
 <p>“Ugh…” Zegna sighed in satisfaction. After he wore the black robe, the terrifying golden-red flames finally went out.</p>
 <p>“Sun’s Child? How did he do that?” Zegna was puzzled, and even afraid. He had to admit that Leylin was full of miracles, and seemed to be his nemesis.</p>
 <p>“I don’t know.” Narsha’s voice turned cold. “What you need to worry about is the Pond of Lamentation… To save a fool like you, I consumed more than half of its energy. You need to begin amassing resources more…”</p>
 <p>“What?” When Zegna saw that there was only a thin layer of black gas left, his face fell, “That’s not possible! I put in all of my accumulated wealth to construct this…”</p>
 <p>“Then you’ll need to launch the next plan…” She spoke slowly.</p>
 <p>The secret room descended into silence, and only after a very long while could a low sound of acknowledgement be heard.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>The incident in Sky City ended with the fall of a Radiant Moon Magus. The fall of someone of such status immediately swept through the continent like a hurricane.</p>
 <p>This was a great rank 5 Magus! There were few of them even in the entire central continent, and they were truly among the top strata of the Magus World’s society. They were the goals of all young Magi, and each one held an immense reputation for their battle strength. Even if they weren’t in control of the large organisations, their statuses were second only to Monarchs. Their experiences could be written down as legend, forming an enriching story!</p>
 <p>Someone like that had actually fallen? And at the hands of a Morning Star Magus?</p>
 <p>The first reaction most Magi had after hearing this was disbelief, but when conclusive evidence was shown, and especially with the announcement of Stuart’s subsequent expulsion by the Monarch of the Skies, the central continent sank into a strange silence.</p>
 <p>The Magi collectively lost their voices. This was killing a Radiant Moon at the Morning Star realm! It was no longer the purview of a genius. Leylin was a demon!</p>
 <p>If he could even kill Radiant Moons, what were Morning Stars worth? How many organisations had Breaking Dawn Monarchs in their midst in the central continent?</p>
 <p>Hence, many Magi organisations added Leylin to the list of people they absolutely could not provoke. The Ouroboros Clan even received regular expressions of goodwill and discreet inquiries, both out in the open and in the shadows. It kept the two dukes extremely busy.</p>
 <p>The main character in this story—the most powerful Kemoyin Warlock, and the most powerful Morning Star in history— went missing. Duke Leylin Farlier had mysteriously disappeared from the public eye.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Torrential rain fell down from the skies. There was lightning everywhere, and one could see meteorites every once in a while.</p>
 <p>The heart of the fight between the Radiant Moon Arcane Art and rank 6 bloodline imprint had been in Sky City, but close to 10% of the central continent had been affected. Abnormality in the climate was only a small part of it; spatial rifts had opened up everywhere, and would likely have to be closed up by Monarchs.</p>
 <p>A secret room had been opened in the middle of a desolate mountain. There were no channels for external communication, and countless concealing runes filled the surroundings, sealing this place up.</p>
 <p>A figure dressed in tattered platinum robes was half-leaning on the rock walls, observing the back of his hands and looking deep in thought.</p>
 <p>“My battle might right now is comparable to Radiant Moons! On top of that, the bloodline imprint of the rank 6 Sun’s Child has an immensely terrifying radiation. Even if all the Prophets in the central continent work together, they still won’t be able to track me down…”</p>
 <p>Leylin was very confident in his hiding abilities. It would require a Breaking Dawn Prophet to act, and even they would only be able to find slight traces of him. However, there were few such Magi across all of history, and there were likely none in the present. Hence, he was rather at ease when it came to his safety.</p>
 <p>“I never thought that the backlash from the Sun’s Flames would be so immense!” Recalling the scene from that day, a wry smile appeared about his lips. Under the threat of Stuart’s Radiant Moon Arcane Art, Leylin had brazenly used the bloodline imprint on his left hand and launched a terrifying attack.</p>
 <p>It was as if the ancient Sun’s Child had been revived. The moment Sun Scorching Nirvana was launched, the Radiant Moon Arcane Art was torn apart, and even Stuart had fallen there and then.</p>
 <p>That was not all. Leylin had even followed the path of the curse and sent a portion of the might of the spell to the caster. Even if Zegna wasn’t dead, he would at least have some injuries at this point.</p>
 <p>Such a terrifying rank 6 spell had been launched through a bloodline imprint, and had still almost extracted everything from Leylin.</p>
 <p>As Leylin was not rank 6 and definitely not the Sun’s Child, he had also been hit with a backlash from the Sun’s Flames.</p>
 <p>If not for him having another of the bloodline imprint to protect him and the black flames of the Emberflame Technique having the unique effect of controlling those flames, he would not only be gravely injured but even die!</p>
 <p>There were definitely more than one or two in history who had died from the backlash of employing a spell that far surpassed their ability, and Leylin had almost followed in their footsteps.</p>
 <p>“Thankfully, I’m fine. It would’ve been way too sad if I’d been killed by my own spell…” Leylin’s heart was still palpitating in fear.</p>
 <p>“Whatever it is, I’ve finally healed all of my injuries today. What should I do next? I need to think it over properly!”</p>
