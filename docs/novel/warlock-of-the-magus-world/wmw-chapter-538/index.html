 <p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Bloodline of the Sun’s Child </strong></span></p>
 <p>“I’m afraid the conditions here are still inadequate for the last bloodline purification and activation process!” Leylin scrutinised the entire laboratory, the crystal-like ground as well as the unique radiance emitted by the walls.</p>
 <p>Such an environment was a good location for experiments even for a Morning Star Magus.</p>
 <p>Even so, some of the steps required to activate an ancient bloodline were very troublesome, and even posed a certain amount of danger. It was still best that these sorts of experiments were conducted in one’s Magus Tower.</p>
 <p>But there was still a period of time before Leylin’s Magus Tower could be completed, hence it was still necessary to remodel and reinforce the place as appropriate.</p>
 <p>As he looked at the muddled breeding pool, he was no longer bothered by the yells and struggles inside it. Instead, he gave a few orders to the formation genie before leaving the place directly.</p>
 <p>“Morning Star Magus Tower!” Although Leylin had only been gone a short period of time, the headquarters of the Ouroboros Clan had undergone many changes.</p>
 <p>The number of Warlocks in the place had increased. With the war having calmed down, many refugees from other territories had fled here. On top of that, there was now a tall tower built in an eye-catching position.</p>
 <p>This Magus Tower was not only a few times larger than his old one, it was also filled with a sense of terrifying grandeur, its peak appearing to pierce through space itself.</p>
 <p>This was the Morning Star Magus Tower than the Oakheart Clan and the other bloodline Warlock families of the Ouroboros Clan had cooperated to build for Leylin.</p>
 <p>Although the construction of the tower could not be completed this soon, the rough framework had already been set up.</p>
 <p>A large number of high-ranked Warlocks, as well as Magus craftsmen and formation Magi from other regions surrounded the Magus Tower, working tirelessly.</p>
 <p>“Your Grace!” Faisal and Parker immediately came to greet him at Freya’s side.</p>
 <p>“You guys have done well during this period of time!” Leylin smiled at Freya before speaking to Faisal and the others.</p>
 <p>“It’s because we adopted Your Grace’s blueprints and followed your advice. We’re confident that we’ll be able to complete the construction more quickly than normal.” Faisal reported respectfully.</p>
 <p>There was still a slight shock in his heart. In his view, with Leylin being able to promote to the Morning Star realm at the mere age of 200 or so, his talent as a Warlock was incomparable to begin with. What he did not expect was that Leylin could actually focus on both the construction and formation spells whilst undergoing Magus practice. It made Leylin seem monstrous.</p>
 <p>Of course, those thoughts were hidden within his heart. He definitely couldn’t show them on the surface.</p>
 <p>“Good! Pass down my command: the work is to be halted every night. I want to handle it personally, in a more in-depth manner,” Leylin said plainly.</p>
 <p>“Could it be that you want to…” Faisal’s eyes sparkled, and he left shortly after.</p>
 <p>“Now, who can overthrow you?” Leylin looked at his own Morning Star Magus Tower, a confident look emerging on his face.</p>
 <p>His previous Magus Tower had been destroyed by the Oakheart Clan, but now they’d had to pay with a Morning Star Magus Tower instead.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, Leylin was now confident in his own strength. Even in the entire central continent, there were not many who could destroy his Magus Tower again. He also would not allow himself to fall into such a low.</p>
 <p>Leylin looked at the huge landmark-like Magus Tower and a slight joking expression flashed in his eyes. “Perhaps, after millions of years, this Magus Tower will come to symbolise me. Let it stand here forever!”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Deep in the night. There was not a single Magus around the Morning Star Magus Tower anymore, even Faisal and the others had left the place long ago.</p>
 <p>They understood that the Magus Tower was the core of a Magus’ power. Surely Leylin had some secrets that he would set up, and the fewer that knew the better.</p>
 <p>Moreover, the intense radiation of a Morning Star Warlock would exert great pressure on them. It would be safer to avoid it.</p>
 <p>Leylin walked alone inside the empty Magus Tower.</p>
 <p>Most of the runes and spell formations hadn’t been set up yet, and many of the basic amenities were also unused. The Tower right now was just an empty shell without a defence.</p>
 <p>“A.I. Chip! Begin scanning the entire Magus Tower, slowly adjust the radiation power!” Leylin commanded.</p>
 <p>[Mission acquired, beginning synchronisation! Adjusting…] The A.I. Chip immediately responded.</p>
 <p>Accompanying the A.I. Chip’s sound, a 3D structure appeared before Leylin. A brilliant radiance was also emitted from his body that began to merge with the entire structure.</p>
 <p>Compared to the previous time where his radiation spread out without discrimination in Scarlet Crescent, destroying everything, Leylin was currently extremely careful in controlling it. This process allowed the Magus Tower to slowly accept it and adapt.</p>
 <p>High ranked Magi could revitalise ancient materials through their radiation, and even produce many anomalies. This was common knowledge in the central continent. Although Leylin’s Magus Tower made use of high-quality materials, he still needed to use his radiation to unify the materials in order to let it reach its peak condition.</p>
 <p>Many rumours held that there were often ghosts, vengeful spirits, and other such things where Magi lived, a byproduct of the changes a Magus’ radiation caused in the surrounding territory.</p>
 <p>Leylin was currently strengthening his Magus Tower, and at the same time leaving his own mark on it.</p>
 <p>Even if it was deliberately held back, the radiation of a Morning Star Magus was a disaster for weaker Magi. This was why Faisal had immediately transferred those Magi away as night arrived.</p>
 <p>As for other times? Based on Leylin’s control, as well as the compressive abilities of the point mass, he had long since become able to securely lock up the radiation in his own body. Since he didn’t leak the slightest bit, there would be no problem.</p>
 <p>If someone looked from outside, they would see a beautiful view. Standing out from the surrounding darkness, a Morning Star Magus Tower seemed to be wrapped up in a colourful radiance. Even the dark sky was dyed with its colours.</p>
 <p>If they got closer, they would hear an increasingly clear hiss of a giant serpent, causing one’s hair to stand.</p>
 <p>What accompanied the hissing of the giant serpent was another sound which seemed like a singing curse yet at the same time like a worshipping voice. It surrounded the entire Magus Tower, making it seem mysterious.</p>
 <p>Because Leylin had joined in himself, the construction of the Magus Tower had been sped up. The building seemed to be morphing day to day.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>“It has finally reached this point!” Leylin’s pupils gleamed with excitement as he watched the gold creature in the large confinement room.</p>
 <p>Now, the blood-sucking loach had completely lost its previous image. Instead, it had transformed into a terrifying creature that was similar to the golden dragons from legend.</p>
 <p>Golden scales covered its entire body, their glimmer making it seem as if it was a god from the ancient times. On its forehead was a rune in the shape of a sun, emitting a blazing light.</p>
 <p>Leylin had a premonition– if it was not for him suppressing this beast all this time, the first thing the creature would do was probably to transform into a gigantic fireball, rising from the ashes and advancing to the Morning Star realm.</p>
 <p>In other words, this was a Morning Star creature!</p>
 <p>Now, creatures of this level were already very rare. If it were placed among the circles of Morning Star Magi, it would probably cause a huge sensation, even more so encouraging the emergence of another bloodline Warlock clan.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing Leylin, the golden dragon howled and a blood-red light flashed in its pupils. It immediately turned towards him, emitting an aura unique to the dragon race.</p>
 <p>The layer of glass in front was instantly drowned in a brilliant golden flame.</p>
 <p>The tempered glass warped under the extreme heat, cracks beginning to form on its surface.</p>
 <p>“Oh! You deliberately kept your firepower a secret, huh. This level of intelligence already surpasses that of a wild beast!” Leylin laughed without much ado. As he watched the golden dragon displaying its invincible might, he could not help but think of the ancient Sun’s Child, wondering what rank of power and influence it possessed!</p>
 <p>“What a pity! I created you, and I can also destroy you at any time!” A chill suddenly appeared in Leylin's pupils, making the golden dragon retract its neck.</p>
 <p>“Blood seal!” A crimson radiance flashed in Leylin’s eyes as his right hand reached out to grab the golden dragon.</p>
 <p>*Bang!* Immediately, a large amount of blood began to flow out from beneath the golden dragon’s scales, turning it red in a moment. Its original dignified roar had been replaced by a pitiful cry.</p>
 <p>“Even locked to 35% of its bloodline, it’s still so terrifying?” A hint of worry flashed across Leylin’s face as he watched the shrieking creature.</p>
 <p>The experiment that he had performed on the golden dragon previously out of convenience had immediately allowed him to understand the stubborn nature passed down through its bloodline.</p>
 <p>‘However, this sort of attitude verifies the Wisdom Tree’s hypothesis. Now all I need is extended research, clinical trials, and then…’ Leylin stroked his chin and made up his mind.</p>
 <p>‘But the good thing is that the bloodline of the Sun’s Child has been completely activated. It’s the bloodline of an ancient rank 6 creature after all, and even a drop is enough to create another Morning Star creature!’ The corner of his lips curled up in a slight smile.</p>
 <p>“Now, onto the final phase…”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>*Boom!*</p>
 <p>A ball of golden blood which was the size of a fist floated in the air like a fireball. It released a terrifying amount of light and heat, slowly raising the temperature of the room.</p>
 <p>The temperature was so high, in fact, that space itself distorted, rifts appearing near the blood. This was the unstable phenomenon resulted from the burning of the sun’s flame.</p>
 <p>“Activate!” Leylin said emotionlessly as he watched the scene.</p>
 <p>A great amount of light emerged with a whoosh, strengthening the surrounding walls. Many runes shot out one one after the other, locking the blood down. At this point, it looked like a miniature sun.</p>
 <p>Leylin had specially reinforced this secret chamber, with the express intent of locking the bloodline of the Sun’s Child. From how it looked, the effect wasn’t rather bad.</p>
 <p>He nodded secretly before looking at the A.I. Chip’s status screen.</p>
 <p>[Beep! Completing the genetic makeup of the Sun’s Child, beginning imitation, deducing according to the meditation technique, Wing of the Sun…] The A.I. Chip intoned loyally.</p>
