 <p>[Beep! Injected spiritual force reaching critical levels!]</p>
 <p>With his sea of consciousness swelling up, and the reminder from the A.I Chip, Leylin realised that not only had his spiritual force reached the value of 399, even his sea of consciousness were filled with black—with a tinge of red in the centre—spiritual force crystals.</p>
 <p>Inside his sea of consciousness, the three layers of the spiritual force core nucleus started to emit dazzling lights.</p>
 <p>‘The results of the first time the bloodline ignition experiment is performed is the best, and they decrease over multiple uses.’ As he could still feel the strong surge of bloodline energy, Leylin ordered, “A.I. Chip, initiate the promotion to Morning Star!”</p>
 <p>[Assignment received! Vital signs under observation, initiating Morning Star deduction, starting from the prototype of the point mass…]</p>
 <p>Numerous amounts of data, both numeric and otherwise, relating to the construction of the point mass began streaming in front of Leylin’s eyes. If not for the Azure Mountain King’s clone, Leylin could never have gotten a hold of all this secret information about the Morning Star realm as easily.</p>
 <p>“Lamia fingerbone!” Looking at the other bloodline treasure, he realised that it was actually his biggest gain from Quicksand Castle. If he were to use it then, he could have advanced immediately to the peak of Rank 3, skipping the Hydro and Crystal Phases.</p>
 <p>Yet, Leylin was one who did not give in easily to temptations, forcing himself to control his impulses and merely using the radiation emitted by the fingerbone to slowly nurture his bloodline.</p>
 <p>Even though the Lamia fingerbone could help him advance tremendously, but under comparison with the advancement to the Morning Star realm, he knew which one was more important. So what’s there left to think about?</p>
 <p>*Peng!* The milky white fingerbone disintegrated into ashes, and one of the rays of lights that appeared during the explosion pointed directly towards Leylin’s forehead.</p>
 <p>*Hong!* The Lamia fingerbone was absorbed into his body.</p>
 <p>A terrifying change started to occur immediately. In Leylin’s sea of consciousness, under an enormous compressive power, numerous amounts of spiritual force crystals moved towards the centre.</p>
 <p>His face paled under the enormous pressure exerted at the heart of his spiritual force. It was so bad that his whole body started twitching.</p>
 <p>The sea of consciousness was essentially the home of the soul. The moment that it experienced any damage, the Magus would be in deep trouble.</p>
 <p>Under the immense pressure that the spiritual force was experiencing, sounds could be heard coming from the centre of Leylin’s sea of consciousness. It wasn’t a good sign.</p>
 <p>“Construct the fourth innate spell!” Leylin commanded with red eyes.</p>
 <p>[Beginning assignment. Supplementary work initiated, transferring atomic microscope!] the A.I Chip replied loyally.</p>
 <p>Leylin’s sea of consciousness consisted of three layers presently. The outer layer held runes for two innate spells— one for Kemoyin’s Scales and the other for the Eye of Petrification. On the layer beneath was the rune for rank 2— Toxic Bile. The innermost layer held rank 3 spiritual force crystals, consisting of his rank 3 innate spell— Intimidating Gaze.</p>
 <p>Under a sudden flash of red light, the three layers of runes perfectly combined, forming the exquisite image of a Warlock’s rune. Yet, it was missing one final thing.!</p>
 <p>At this very moment, a fourth layer of crystals started to appear in the centre of the third layer.</p>
 <p>As the centre of the core nucleus had a unique structure, the crystals became smaller as one went closer to the centre, but at the same time, the details on each rune became more intricate and they grew much more specialised.</p>
 <p>At the centre of the fourth layer, even though it was a quarter the size of the first layer, it was still important that there be no errors when one was carving the rank 4 rune. That was an out-of-the-world request of a Magus’ spritiual force manipulation abilities.</p>
 <p>“It's no wonder that most Magi fail at advancing to rank 4. Even with the assistance provided by the A.I, Chip, this task seems to be too difficult …”</p>
 <p>With the help provided by the A.I. Chip, Leylin who had already initiated the atomic microscope had started to carve down the Kemoyin’s Pupil innate spell on the fourth layer with the innate runes he’d recorded.</p>
 <p>This was something every Warlock must choose and only in high-grade meditation techniques do innate spell models like these exist.</p>
 <p>The attention to detail required to carve a rune in the sea of consciousness was much greater than carving a statue, and the act was much more difficult. Once Leylin completed the final stroke of the rune, his body almost collapsed due to exhaustion.</p>
 <p>Under the immense pressure, it seemed like completing the fourth level rune properly was a big challenge. It took a while for Leylin’s consciousness to stabilize.</p>
 <p>Once the innate spell had been completed, his entire sea of consciousness started to tremble.</p>
 <p>Boundless rays of lights started to radiate from the centre of his sea of consciousness. The four layers of intricate runes started to bind together in a picturesque order, much like a piece of artwork.</p>
 <p>Once the centremost part was filled up, the entire crystal started to shake violently, strengthening tremendously within seconds and the immense pressure that was present previously had disappeared.</p>
 <p>“This rune?” Leylin observed the rune that was a combination of all his innate runes. It represented all of his achievements so far, and hence he commanded the A.I. Chip to record it down.</p>
 <p>Perfection! The first impression this rune would leave on a person was that of perfection!</p>
 <p>A gigantic rune was created by the combination of these small runes, which cirulated continuously and looked pretty much 3D. Regardless of how one looked at it, it was flawless.</p>
 <p>“Is this… the path of my bloodline?” Leylin mumbled. At this very moment, he was almost moved to tears.</p>
 <p>*Rustle!* Once the four layers perfectly crystallized, they started to crumble inwards, shrinking to a point that rapidly started revolving. Much like a black hole, it started to suck in everything in its surroundings.</p>
 <p>The spiritual force crystals inside his sea of consciousness started to shrink as they got sucked into the black hole.</p>
 <p>[Initiating the construction of point mass. Guidelines activated.] the A.I. Chip reported.</p>
 <p>Leylin, too, started to construct his personal point mass according to his understanding and the information from his A.I. Chip.</p>
 <p>*Boom!* An immense suction force could be felt coming from the mass point of the spiritual force. Not only were the spiritual force crystals sucked in, even the sea of consciousness was broken through and more energy, flesh and soul aura were pulled in.</p>
 <p>*Slap!* Leylin’s consciousness suddenly blurred. Time seemed to pass extremely slowly, and at times it felt like eternity was squeezed into an instant.</p>
 <p>It took the sounds of glass shattering for Leylin to wake up again.</p>
 <p>This time, his sea of consciousness felt empty. There was a dim light shining at the centre of the core, the result of shrinking the spiritual force a million times over such that the nucelus core’s density and purity had reached an remarkable level. This was the point mass of a Morning Star Magus!</p>
 <p>The source of the light shook, and the purified energy of the Morning Star realm, the energy of the point mass that was also known as soul force, started to leak out into the entirety of Leylin’s body.</p>
 <p>At that point, he had entered the Morning Star realm!</p>
 <p>[Beep! Host’s Kemoyin’s Pupil meditation technique has advanced to the fourth level. Host has advanced to rank 4!]</p>
 <p>The A.I. Chip sounded out.</p>
 <p>[Host’s spiritual force has undergone a qualitative change. Data is inaccurate, recalculating…]</p>
 <p>It was a long time for the new data to go up.</p>
 <p>[Leylin Farlier, rank 4 Warlock Bloodline: Giant Kemoyin Serpent (complete form) Strength: 50, Agility: 45, Vitality: 65, Spiritual Force: 503.7, Magic Power: 503 (magic power in synchronisation with spiritual force) Soul Force: ???]</p>
 <p>[Due to a lack of information about soul force, it is currently not possible to calculate stats.]</p>
 <p>Looking at the A.I. Chip’s report, Leylin touched his chin and went into deep thought.</p>
 <p>After advancing to the Morning Star realm, the original spiritual force would undergo purification and turn into soul force. This energy was on a whole new level compared to spiritual force! Yet, as the information and data that the A.I. Chip had on soul force was limited, there was too little knowledge in the database to display a value. It could only display numbers in terms of spiritual force.</p>
 <p>He had to wait until the A.I Chip had collected sufficient data to thoroughly calculate his soul force statistics.</p>
 <p>“The boundary of the Morning Star realm is 500?” Leylin felt the terror of having such strong energy and sighed, “This is nearly a hundred higher than a rank 3’s spiritual force value. It is no wonder rank 3 and rank 4 are worlds apart.</p>
 <p>“Soul force!” Something came into Leylin mind and a gloomy light appeared above his palm. This was the mutated spiritual force from the point mass, it is also an energy of a greater level.</p>
 <p>All Magi at the Morning Star realm and above used soul force. It was only when one reached this stage that they could find their own path in life.</p>
 <p>“This is why in ancient times, Magi below rank 4 weren’t even deemed to have entered the world of Magi yet.”</p>
 <p>There was a huge difference between rank 3 and rank 4, and the same was true between ranks 6 and 7. Leylin had no idea about what happened one reached rank 7, but after advancing he now clearly knew the differences between ranks 3 and 4.</p>
 <p>“Magi at rank 3 and below mainly use spiritual force. However, once that is crossed, the Morning Star, Radiant Moon and Breaking Dawn Magi will have to come in contact with the soul force and pay extra attention to explore the potential in their soul”</p>
 <p>Leylin couldn’t help but look at his own point mass. In the heart of his sea of consciousness, that small glow of light continued to spin around, forming a nebular spiral that pulled many of the energy particles around within, only to regurgitate them upon purification.</p>
 <p>From this point forth, his spirit had been concentrated into the point mass, creating a truesoul. At the same time, due to the protection from the point mass, his resistance toward the previous spiritual force and soul attacks were largely maximised.</p>
 <p>The point mass, with its extreme density, was the last defence of Leylin’s truesoul.</p>
 <p>“My truesoul...” Leylin subconsciously remembered the last moment before he advanced.</p>
 <p>In that instant, it seemed as though he saw the life and death of the universe, and also the rise and fall of the Giant Kemoyin Serpent clan. It was also at that very moment that his soul truly bonded with his bloodline to form one body, making him a true Giant Kemoyin Serpent Warlock!</p>
