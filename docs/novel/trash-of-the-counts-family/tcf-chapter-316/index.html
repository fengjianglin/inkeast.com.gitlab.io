 <p>“…However I want?”</p>
 <p>Cale nodded his head at the GPS-like voice that had returned to its normal calmness.</p>
 <p>“Yes. I don't care whether you take it all or share it with others. Do whatever you want.”</p>
 <p>Mary looked back and forth between Cale and the tree trunks. The glutton was talking in Cale's mind as he watched Mary.</p>
 <ul>
  <li>It needs to be purified. There’s a limit to how long the trees can hold it in.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>The Man-Eating Tree in the Henituse territory.<br>People had avoided the desolate area around the tree, however, that area had not become a dead area from dead mana.</p>
 <p>Everything would just dry up over there.</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Dead things that do not return to nature and instead remain in the world start to cause issues for other lifeforms.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Just like the Man-Eating Tree.<br>It could have a negative effect on the surrounding area.</p>
 <p>“Hmm? Everybody is out here?”</p>
 <p>Cale raised his head after suddenly hearing a voice.</p>
 <p>He looked above a black tree trunk that had grown tall. The Dark Elf Tasha was looking down from the top of the tree.</p>
 <p>The Dark Elves were currently assisting the warriors in restoring the Jungle after the battle. It was because the Elementals with different elements were quite helpful for the restoration projects.</p>
 <p>“I, mm, rushed here, so I am happy to see you right away.”</p>
 <p>Tasha had an awkward expression on her face as she jumped off the tree trunk.</p>
 <p>Cale looked toward Tasha instead of the quiet Mary.<br>No, to be more specific, he was looking at the man behind Tasha who had an extremely shocked expression on his face.</p>
 <p>‘Why is he here?’</p>
 <p>Cale had a questioning gaze on his face while Tasha could only smile apologetically toward him.</p>
 <p>“Well, once I reported the situation-”<br>“Oh! My goodness! Oh, oh, oh!”</p>
 <p>The man behind Tasha cut her off and continued to exclaim in admiration.</p>
 <p>‘Aigoo.’</p>
 <p>Cale was starting to get a headache. However, his body quickly started to move. He had no other choice.</p>
 <p>“This worthless fool does not dare to see such a revered being's face while standing on my two legs!”<br>“Mayor-nim!”<br>“Grandfather! Please!”</p>
 <p>Cale and Tasha quickly grabbed Obante, the mayor of the Dark Elves’ Underground City, as he tried to kneel. <span id="footnote-ref-d1f4"><a href="#footnote-d1f4">[1]</a></span><br>Tasha’s grandfather was still the same.</p>
 <ul>
  <li>This Dark Elf is acting like this again!</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Cale did not have the time to listen to Raon's excited voice.</p>
 <p>“Oh, my goodness!”<br>“Grandfather, please!”</p>
 <p>Tasha tried to stop him, but the Dark Elf mayor was completely astonished after seeing the person standing right outside Cale's tent.</p>
 <p>It was a man with white gold hair.<br>It was Eruhaben.<br>The last person to come out of Cale's tent had a video communication device connected with crown prince Alberu in his hand.<br>He was the only one who remembered about Alberu when everybody else had forgotten about him and rushed out, as well as the person who had been quietly observing everything from a corner of the tent.</p>
 <p>The current mayor of the Dark Elves who had lived for over 500 years could not think about anything after feeling a cold presence.</p>
 <p>‘This level of presence……!’</p>
 <p>The other Dark Elves who had never met a Dragon before and thus could not accurately pick up on Eruhaben and the invisible Raon’s presence.<br>However, mayor Obante who had seen a Dragon in the past was immediately able to know Eruhaben's true identity.</p>
 <p>He also got chills after realizing that he could not feel Raon's presence.</p>
 <p>‘…Raon-nim has gotten much stronger!’</p>
 <p>Obante could tell that Raon had gotten much stronger than him because, unlike last time, he was unable to feel Raon's presence while he was invisible.</p>
 <p>“Mayor-nim.”</p>
 <p>Obante turned his head after hearing a low voice calling for him.<br>He could see Cale Henituse looking at him.</p>
 <p>‘…He's gotten stronger.’</p>
 <p>He could feel the presence of nature flowing out of Cale. His Elemental was circling around Cale without knowing what to do.</p>
 <p>‘…Has it been one year now?’</p>
 <p>It had been about a year since they had first met.<br>Just what could have happened to Cale's group during this time?</p>
 <p>‘The war made them this much stronger?’</p>
 <p>That was nonsense. He believed that there was a different reason that they got this much stronger.<br>Although that reason was important, it wasn’t very important to mayor Obante.</p>
 <p>His gaze then brushed past Mary.<br>She was like a granddaughter to him.<br>At the same time, he thought about the Land of Death, as well as the Underground City underneath where he was mayor.</p>
 <p>He thought about the Circle of Fate that had been passed down for generations.<br>That fate was finally starting to appear during this generation.</p>
 <p>He peeked toward the Dragon with white-gold hair.<br>The two of them made eye contact.</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Ignore me.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>He could hear the Dragon's voice.<br>Obante put strength into both of his legs and stood up straight.</p>
 <p>Cale flinched after seeing the way Obante was looking at him.<br>Forget passionate, it looked a bit… crazed.</p>
 <p>‘What’s up with this old man?’</p>
 <p>Cale felt chills on his back after seeing this Dragon maniac looking at him with such a fierce gaze.</p>
 <p>Pat.</p>
 <p>Obante put a hand on Cale's shoulder and whispered in his ear.</p>
 <p>“I will put everything on the line as well.”</p>
 <p>‘What is he talking about?<br>What nonsense is he spewing after just showing up here?’</p>
 <p>Cale looked away from the fiery gaze of the mayor and looked toward Tasha.</p>
 <p>“Ah, seriously! Mayor-nim, how can you put it like that?!”</p>
 <p>Tasha looked toward Cale with an annoyed expression and started to speak.</p>
 <p>“I informed the mayor-nim about the Dark Elves’ battles last night. The mayor-nim then said that he had something to say regarding Mary and rushed over. He also said that he had something to give to you, young master Cale.”<br>“…Mary?”</p>
 <p>Cale’s gaze turned back toward the mayor.<br>The mayor started to speak at that moment.</p>
 <p>“Mary.”</p>
 <p>He gently called Mary’s name.</p>
 <p>“Yes, grandfather.”</p>
 <p>Obante looked toward Mary who was responding calmly as usual and recalled when she was ten years old.</p>
 <p>‘I prefer the hurting necromancer.’</p>
 <p>She had chosen to become a necromancer when given the option of becoming a black mage or a necromancer.</p>
 <p>“What kind of necromancer do you want to be?”</p>
 <p>Obante asked a question he had not asked back then. Mary closed her mouth after hearing that question.<br>Obante’s gaze was too serious for her to give an answer without thinking about it.<br>Although he might be goofy, this was the wisest Dark Elf in the world. He was also the nice grandfather who had opened up the path for her to become a necromancer.</p>
 <p>Mary looked toward Cale.<br>She could hear Raon's voice.</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Good little Mary! Answer however you want! I will even give you permission to use the words, ‘great and mighty,’ in order to describe yourself!</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Mary started to smile underneath the black robe.</p>
 <p>She had made up her mind about something during the last battle when she fought against the Tower Master who was controlling Honte.<br>It was similar to the author of the book she had studied from.</p>
 <p>&lt; You just have to be almost unrivaled in strength. &gt;<br>&lt; Like me. The Sage of Death. &gt;</p>
 <p>Mary shared her thoughts with Obante.</p>
 <p>“Unrivaled.”</p>
 <p>She was hungry.<br>She became hungry after seeing the trees that were filled with dead mana.</p>
 <p>Hungry was the only way Mary knew to describe this feeling.<br>It was because she had never felt this type of greed or desire before. It was different than when all she wanted to do was to see the outside world.<br>It was a greed that dug as deep as a swamp.</p>
 <p>She wanted to get stronger.<br>That was her greed and desire.<br>She was hungry because she had not reached the level that she wanted to be at.</p>
 <p>“I want to become strong enough to be unrivaled.”</p>
 <p>Mayor Obante continued to gently ask.</p>
 <p>“Like who?”</p>
 <p>Mary did not hesitate to answer.</p>
 <p>“Like the Sage of Death.”</p>
 <p>That was the author who had taught her about the path to becoming a necromancer.</p>
 <p>&lt; I hope you become even stronger than me. My disciple who will be reading this book. &gt;</p>
 <p>She wanted to be like her.</p>
 <p>Tasha flinched after hearing Mary’s response.<br>There was something her grandfather Obante had told her before she came to the Jungle while telling her to protect Mary.</p>
 <p>‘Yes, this may all just be nature taking its course. It is finally time for someone to receive the will of the Sage of Death.’</p>
 <p>She had questioned who the Sage of Death was at that time. Tasha’s gaze automatically turned toward Obante.<br>However, Obante was looking at Cale instead. He opened his mouth to speak.</p>
 <p>“The Sage of Death.”</p>
 <p>Obante took a book out of his clothes.<br>It was a story that had been passed down to the mayor of the Underground City for generations after generations.<br>The Sage of Death.</p>
 <p>“She is death itself.”</p>
 <p>She had embraced death.<br>Furthermore.</p>
 <p>“She was the only Queen of the dark beings.”</p>
 <p>Both light and darkness were part of nature.<br>She had been the one to gather together the beings who could only live in darkness.</p>
 <p>“The Queen of Death.” <span id="footnote-ref-6413"><a href="#footnote-6413">[2]</a></span></p>
 <p>Cale recalled what the Tower Master had said during the battle once the Dark Elf mayor said that title.</p>
 <p>‘The Queen of Death will be so sad. She would have been happy that another necromancer had appeared.’</p>
 <p>The Sage of Death was the Queen of Death.<br>However, Obante was not finished speaking.</p>
 <p>“She was the one who turned the Caro Kingdom's desert into the Land of Death of the Five Forbidden Regions.”</p>
 <p>The Land of Death was the only one of the Five Forbidden Regions where a person was the main focal point of the legend.<br>It was a desert that had red sand during the day and black sand at night.<br>She had created that desert.</p>
 <p>“She was the final necromancer.”</p>
 <p>The sage, queen, and the final being.</p>
 <p>“She was called the, ‘Queen of Death,’ as she was the only necromancer to overpower black mages.”</p>
 <p>She was someone who had reached the zenith of darkness with overwhelming and unrivaled power.</p>
 <p>“She was also the person who created a place for the Dark Elves to live.”</p>
 <p>A place for the Dark Elves to live.<br>She had created that large underground city that was called the City of Death or the City of Life.</p>
 <p>Cale recalled something else that the Tower Master had said.</p>
 <p>‘I barely managed to get rid of all of them. The Dark Elves as well. I thought I had dried out their seeds.’</p>
 <p>The Alchemists’ Bell Tower’s Tower Master had thought that the Dark Elves were gone as well.<br>However, they were living underneath the Land of Death.<br>Obante started to smile.</p>
 <p>“It's a long story to explain, but the black mages tried to kill the Dark Elves as well.”<br>“…Grandfather! Is that true?”</p>
 <p>Tasha asked in shock while Obante just shook his head while saying that it was ancient history.</p>
 <p>“The Dark Elves were responsible for making the Underground City beautiful, however, the Sage of Death was the one to originally provide that place for us.”</p>
 <p>Obante closed his eyes as if he was thinking about the story that was only passed on from mayor to mayor.</p>
 <p>The Dark Elves did not hate the humans who despised them generation after generation.<br>Why?</p>
 <p>It was because each Dark Elf in charge of the Underground City had said something to them since a long time ago.</p>
 <p>‘Humans are similar to us.<br>Do not hate all of them.<br>There are humans who are suffering like us.’</p>
 <p>They could not hate all humans as it was a, ‘human,’ who had provided the Dark Elves a place to live.</p>
 <p>Obante looked toward Cale and continued to speak.</p>
 <p>“I will put our full force forward in order to help all of you, and-”</p>
 <p>The old man's wrinkled hand went up to Mary’s shoulder.</p>
 <p>“We will help Mary.”</p>
 <p>The Sage of Death was said to have said something before her death.</p>
 <p>&lt; The next King of Death can only be a necromancer. &gt; <span id="footnote-ref-e246"><a href="#footnote-e246">[3]</a></span></p>
 <p>The Dark Elf Obante could not disagree with that.<br>Why?</p>
 <p>It was because both Dark Elves, black mages, and other beings of darkness did not know the pain that darkness could bring.<br>They were especially clueless about death.</p>
 <p>However, necromancers always kept pain and death by their side.</p>
 <p>&lt; The position of king is something that only someone who has experienced rock bottom and the lowest point can achieve. &gt;</p>
 <p>Obante thought about the word, ‘fate.’</p>
 <p>10 years old.<br>A child had escaped from a human city and ran across the desert in order to survive. That child had ended up a necromancer with a disgusting appearance.<br>And then, black magic reappeared in the world once that child came back out to the world seventeen years late.</p>
 <p>Many things that Obante had never even imagined would happen were happening.</p>
 <p>The position of, ‘Mayor of the City of Death.’<br>The Dark Elves never had a king even though the Whale tribe, who were fewer in number, had a king.<br>The majority of Dark Elves did not know the reason behind this as it had been too long, however, the mayor knew the reason.</p>
 <p>The position of king was already taken.</p>
 <p>Obante patted the blankly staring Mary’s shoulder before handing the book in his hand to Cale.</p>
 <p>"This is the book the Sage of Death had left behind about black magic.”</p>
 <p>He had offered this book to Mary along with the necromancer book.</p>
 <p>“The Sage said that there would be different owners for this book and the necromancer book.”</p>
 <p>Cale received the book that was covered in black.<br>There was no title on the black book.</p>
 <p>“The Sage said that the rightful owner of this book would know it belonged to them once they read the first page.”</p>
 <p>Obante was telling Cale to read this book similar to how Mary had chosen the necromancer book after reading through it.<br>Cale opened the black book with an odd expression on his face.</p>
 <p>Flip.<br>He could see what was written on the first page.</p>
 <p>‘Oh, would you look at this?’</p>
 <p>Cale started to smile.<br>There was a phrase written on the black book.</p>
 <p>&lt; Find the mirror. &gt;</p>
 <p>The mirror.<br>He thought about the Condemnation of the Sun. It was a divine item.</p>
 <p>Cale suddenly got the chills.</p>
 <p>He started to wonder just how much story was not in the first five volumes of, ‘The Birth of a Hero.’<br>How were things all connected?<br>Maybe everything had changed as a result of cause and effect now that this was the, ‘real world.’</p>
 <p>Cale had an image appear in his mind after he read the next phrase.</p>
 <p>&lt; Pull out the sword. &gt;</p>
 <p>It would start at the center of the Empire. The image in his mind would start from the bottom of the Alchemists’ Bell Tower.</p>
 <p>&lt; And hand it to your warrior. &gt;</p>
 <p>Cale's gaze turned toward Saint Jack.</p>
 <p>&lt; Warrior, move forward without hesitation. &gt;</p>
 <p>He then turned toward Mary.</p>
 <p>&lt; The Queen of Death will create a path for you. &gt;</p>
 <p>The Sun God twins and the Queen of Death.<br>Cale got chills while thinking about the image that they would create in the Empire.<br>It was the good kind of chills this time.</p>
 <p>He could see the fall of the Alchemists’ Bell Tower, the tallest tower on the Western continent.</p>
