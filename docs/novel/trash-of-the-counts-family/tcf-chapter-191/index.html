 <p><br></p>
 <p>The bishop remained silent.<br>All he did was look at Cale up and down repeatedly.</p>
 <p>They could hear the auctioneer's voice from beyond the curtain.</p>
 <p>“The first item is a fountain pen with a beautiful feather. The feather is, as expected, the remains of a beautiful Beast person.”</p>
 <p>The voice was loud enough to break the silence in terrace 1.</p>
 <p>“How much do you want?”</p>
 <p>A dry voice echoed inside the terrace. The servant almost arrogantly started to discuss the deal. It basically revealed that he was actually the bishop.<br>He asked his question and did not say anything else.</p>
 <p>‘Who are you?’ or, ‘do you really have the item?’<br>Those kinds of questions were not important at all.</p>
 <p>For the bishop, who had experienced all sorts of things throughout his life, the only thing that mattered was the single line in Cale's invitation.</p>
 <p>&lt; Do you wish to gain a divine item? &gt;</p>
 <p>The sentence written underneath that gave credibility to the reason for the invitation.</p>
 <p>&lt; I am in possession of the Night's Exultation that the pope had hidden away. Buy it from me. &gt;</p>
 <p>The bishop knew that the dead pope was a greedy man. That was the reason he had given the Night's Exultation as an offering.<br>He also knew that the pope had a secret area where he kept all of these treasures.</p>
 <p>Wasn’t it possible that a divine item would be in such a location?</p>
 <p>The bishop wanted to become the pope.<br>He was just waiting for the right opportunity to seize the position.</p>
 <p>He continued to observe the man in the white mask in front of him.<br>The masked man had yet to answer his question about how much he wanted for the item. The masked man's uncovered mouth slowly started to open.</p>
 <p>“They say that the Night's Exultation shines even brighter when it comes into contact with dead mana. This is different than how normal items react when they come into contact with dead mana.”</p>
 <p>The bishop sighed and responded back to the masked man who was spewing nonsense.</p>
 <p>“What is it? You want to take your Night's Exultation and experiment with the fake one in the temple?”</p>
 <p>The bishop could hear the masked man scoff at him.<br>Cale shook his head while looking at the bishop.</p>
 <p>“Old man, what a terrible personality you have.”<br>“This is normal as you get older.”</p>
 <p>The priest in front of them flinched, however, he did not turn to look behind him.<br>The priest quietly stood there and pretended to not be aware of the bishop in servant's clothes and the intruder.</p>
 <p>“How much do you want?”</p>
 <p>The bishop asked for the price once again.<br>The Night's Exultation appeared in front of his eyes at that moment.</p>
 <p>“I guess you don't suspect that I'm a spy from the Empire?”</p>
 <p>The bishop bluntly responded back to the masked man’s question.</p>
 <p>“Spy or not, the fact that you are a merchant trying to sell me an item does not change.”</p>
 <p>‘This dude is quite smart.’<br>This was indeed the case. Whether he was a spy from the Empire or not, the bishop cared more about the chance to recover the Night's Exultation and purchase a divine item.</p>
 <p>Cale liked this bishop quite a bit. However, he did not fix the error in the bishop's statement.</p>
 <p>Merchant.<br>Cale was not a merchant.<br>In fact, he was a hunter.</p>
 <p>He was planning on throwing out the baits one by one in order to draw in the prey in front of him into a trap.<br>The first bait was the divine item.<br>The bishop would definitely purchase the Night's Exultation in order to get his hands on a divine item.<br>He needed a way to remain connected to Cale.</p>
 <p>Cale opened his mouth to speak.</p>
 <p>“How much?”<br>“What? Ho!”</p>
 <p>The bishop laughed in disbelief.<br>The punk in front of him was telling him to initiate a starting price. However, the bishop actually liked this.</p>
 <p>Why?<br>It was because this merchant knew who held the upper hand.</p>
 <p>The masked man knew he was in control of this discussion. That was why he was trying to pressure the bishop. The bishop liked intelligent people like this.<br>It made it easier to handle them. The rational people were the ones who understood their gains the best.</p>
 <p>“5.”</p>
 <p>The bishop called out 5 billion to start.<br>It was a reasonable price for the Night's Exultation. This had been the cost when it was originally found.<br>If you consider how long ago it was discovered, it was an astronomical price.<br>However, Cale was stern.</p>
 <p>“How much?”</p>
 <p>The bishop immediately shot back.</p>
 <p>“6.”</p>
 <p>The two of them were in a race in this negotiation. The auction started behind them as well.<br>The negotiation remained calm.</p>
 <p>“How much?”<br>“7.”</p>
 <p>They could hear the auctioneer's voice coming from beyond the terrace.</p>
 <p>“Alright, we have 300 million counds! Any other bids? Ah! An extra 1,000 counds!”</p>
 <p>Cale asked again at the same time.<br>“How much?”</p>
 <p>The priest seemed to be getting anxious because of the two words Cale were repeating over and over. He seemed to be flinching every time it was asked.</p>
 <p>“8.”</p>
 <p>The priest gasped at the bishop's response.<br>Both the bishop and the intruder were making it hard for him to breathe.</p>
 <p>“How much?”</p>
 <p>The bishop could tell that the man in front of him was getting bored.</p>
 <p>“10.”</p>
 <p>10 billion counds.<br>The price had reached the 10 billion level.<br>Although the price was double the original selling price, the bishop could tell something after looking into the masked man's eyes.<br>‘This still is not enough.’</p>
 <p>The bishop started to speak before Cale could open his mouth once again.</p>
 <p>“15.”</p>
 <p>He was now putting the value of the Night's Exultation as the price for the divine item and the pope position.<br>He then added on.</p>
 <p>“However, it is impossible to give you anything more than 10 billion today.”<br>“How much?”</p>
 <p>“Ho.”<br>The bishop could not help but gasp.<br>He started to glare at the masked man.</p>
 <p>“Is that the only thing you know how to say? You're supposed to respect your elders. You little punk.”</p>
 <p>Although the words sounded as if the bishop was scolding him, the tone was gentle. In fact, it even sounded a bit affectionate, but Cale was not one to be tricked by such an act.<br>Cale was tired of speaking and just asked with his gaze.</p>
 <p>‘How much?’</p>
 <p>The bishop lifted his hands up as if he admitted defeat and responded back.</p>
 <p>“20.”</p>
 <p>“Gasp.”</p>
 <p>They could hear the priest gasping in front of them. He seemed to be shocked at the price.</p>
 <p>“That's the max.”</p>
 <p>The bishop shook his head with a tired expression.<br>He was trying to tell Cale that he was telling the truth. However, there was something Cale had learned during his time as Kim Rok Soo.</p>
 <p>‘Hit the corrupted people one extra time.’</p>
 <p>His team leader that had taught him everything about working had given him that advice right before he passed on the team leader position to him.<br>That was very sound advice.</p>
 <p>“How much?”<br>“You son of a bitch.”<br>The bishop now started to swear.<br>Cale did not care as he had heard all sorts of swearing directed at him when he was Kim Rok Soo. The corrupt ones always resorted to swearing when they were in a pinch.</p>
 <p>The bishop closed his eyes and started to speak.</p>
 <p>“…22.”<br>“23.”<br>“…You bastard.”</p>
 <p>The Night's Exultation was settled for 23 billion counds. The bishop rubbed his tired face. However, Cale recalled something else his team leader had said during Cale’s time as Kim Rok Soo.</p>
 <p>‘If they are corrupt and they have a lot of money, try hitting them once more to see what happens.’</p>
 <p>However, Cale did not plan to do so with the bishop.</p>
 <p>‘But if you can use them later, make sure to give them some room to breathe.’</p>
 <p>Since he was planning on using the bishop, there was no reason to rip him off completely and destroy this relationship.<br>Cale was thinking about the future as he observed the bishop calling the priest over. The priest finally turned around and handed over a small money pouch.</p>
 <p>“Here. 10 billion counds.”</p>
 <p>The bishop then threw the pouch to Cale.</p>
 <p>“You are prepared as I expected, bishop-nim.”</p>
 <p>Cale respectfully responded as if he had not been talking casually this whole time while the bishop clicked his tongue.<br>Cale then added one more comment.</p>
 <p>“I will see you once more in the future.”</p>
 <p>That made the bishop start to smile.<br>He heard it as Cale saying that he would come to see him again with the divine item.</p>
 <p>Cale took a piece of paper out of his pocket and put it on top of the table. The location to send the remaining 13 billion counds was written on it.</p>
 <p>Screeech.<br>The curtain opened once again. Cale disappeared out of the terrace with the money pouch in his hand.</p>
 <p>The priest who had been pretending to be anxious this whole time calmly stood up. The calm expression looked as cold as the bishop's face.<br>Actually, it was even colder than the bishop's face.</p>
 <p>“Go investigate that white-haired man.”<br>“Yes, bishop-nim.”</p>
 <p>The bishop who had been pretending to be a servant bowed his head toward the priest.</p>
 <p>Click, click.<br>A magic device in the servant’s chest pocket was activated and the servant’s face changed to that of a forty-year-old man. This scarred face looked as if it belonged to an assassin.</p>
 <p>The bishop sat back down on the chair and leaned back. He then received the magic device from the servant.<br>Click.<br>His face instantly changed to that of the bishop.<br>He brushed his face and started to speak.</p>
 <p>“It is annoying to touch this old face.”</p>
 <p>The bishop's voice had turned into that of an old man as well.</p>
 <p>“It’s also hard to pretend to be old. But it seems like he doesn’t know that I killed the former bishop, right?”<br>“Yes sir, he does not seem to know.”<br>“Start the investigation in the Paerun Kingdom since he has white hair.”<br>“Yes sir.”</p>
 <p>The bishop touched the magic device once again.</p>
 <p>Cale had to deal with Raon's questions as he flew back into terrace 4.</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Human, why did you pretend not to know that he used a magic device to disguise himself? That kind of magic device is hard to acquire! It is precious!</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Cale started to smile.</p>
 <p>“Young master-nim, welcome back.”</p>
 <p>Billos smiled and quickly closed the curtains after saw Cale took off his mask.</p>
 <p>“Did it get resolved properly?”<br>“Yes.”</p>
 <p>Cale nodded his head.</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Human, why did you pretend not to know? I am curious! And the bishop pretended to be scared, but his pupils did not shake at all, just like you said!</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Cale ignored Raon's comments as he recalled what Saint Jack had told him. He had explained the bishop’s appearance.<br>The bishop’s true appearance.</p>
 <p>‘The Caro Kingdom’s bishop is a skinny woman in her thirties with a sharp gaze. That is her true appearance.’</p>
 <p>Cale started to chuckle.</p>
 <p>“It really is scary.”</p>
 <p>A fantasy world really was scary.<br>It was at that moment.</p>
 <p>‘Hmm?’</p>
 <p>Cale suddenly felt chills going down his back.</p>
 <p>“Young master-nim.”</p>
 <p>It was Ron, who was handing him some lemonade. Cale felt the chills on his back as he looked into Ron's eyes. He heard Raon's voice at that moment.</p>
 <ul>
  <li>By the way, human, are you done with the busy errands?</li>
 </ul>
 <p>‘Basically?’<br>Raon continued to speak once Cale nodded his head.</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Human, I've been ignoring the crown prince’s calls since you told me to do so.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Cale felt that something was off.</p>
 <p>‘Hmm? He really did ignore it?’<br>Cale didn’t expect Raon to really ignore the calls. He had no idea about how seriously Raon remembered everything he said.<br>That was the reason for it. Cale felt as if the room was still getting colder.<br>However, Raon seemed oblivious to it as he happily continued to speak.</p>
 <ul>
  <li>He’s been calling you ever since you started chatting with the bishop. This is the tenth call.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>‘What?’<br>That crown prince, Alberu, called 10 times?’</p>
 <ul>
  <li>He left you a voicemail. I’ll let you hear it.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Cale tightly clenched on the cup of lemonade.<br>The crown prince’s voice echoed in his mind.</p>
 <ul>
  <li>The Northern Alliance is starting to move.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>‘…What?’<br>Cale thought that he might not have heard correctly.</p>
 <p>‘The Paerun Kingdom is making their move?<br>It is only February.<br>The ocean hasn't even melted yet!<br>Why?’</p>
 <p>“Son of a bitch.”</p>
 <p>Cale chugged the lemonade in one gulp. The sour taste made him start to frown.</p>
 <p>“Young master-nim?”</p>
 <p>Billos looked toward him in shock. Cale chucked the money pouch he received from the bishop toward Billos. The confused Billos caught the money pouch.<br>Cale then gave him an order.</p>
 <p>“Make sure to buy the Wolf King’s remains.”<br>“Excuse me?”<br>“There’s 10 billion in there, so make it happen.”<br>“E, excuse me? T, ten billion?”</p>
 <p>Cale, who put Billos in this state of shock, continued to speak.</p>
 <p>“I am leaving first with Ron. Ron, lead the way.”</p>
 <p>Cale made Ron, who came as Billos’s servant, take the lead before turning invisible in order to leave the terrace and head for the inn.</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Human, there is another voicemail.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Raon spoke to Cale who was quickly walking.</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Why don’t you pick up? He seems to have something to discuss with you.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Cale started to frown again.</p>
 <p>‘Why does the crown prince need to talk to a trash like me?’</p>
 <p>His back was cold, his mouth had a sour taste, and unexpected things were happening.</p>
 <p>‘This is driving me nuts.’</p>
 <p>He couldn’t help but be annoyed.</p>
