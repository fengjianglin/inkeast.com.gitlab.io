 <p>‘Why did this Vampire come here?’</p> 
 <p>Cale was shocked.<br> He thought this Vampire was going to send him an invitation, and furthermore, how the hell did he know he was here?</p> 
 <p>Flutter.</p> 
 <p>The black bird didn’t care whether Cale was shocked or not and slightly flew up and moved elsewhere.</p> 
 <p>Plop.</p> 
 <p>The bird landed on Alberu Crossman's bed.</p> 
 <p>Chhhhh!</p> 
 <p>The black bird opened up its shiny beautiful black wings and with some elegant movements…</p> 
 <p>“Your highness, Alberu Crossman. Nice to meet you.”</p> 
 <p>It greeted Alberu.</p> 
 <p>“My name is Duke Fredo Von Ejellan of the Endable Kingdom. I currently lead the Vampires of the two continents.”<br> “Hooo.”</p> 
 <p>Alberu quietly mumbled in amazement before slightly bowing toward the black bird.</p> 
 <p>“Nice to meet you as well.”</p> 
 <p>Alberu was speaking somewhat respectfully to follow the proper etiquette of addressing a foreign nation's Duke. The black bird’s eyes slightly curled up in response.</p> 
 <p>“I wished to meet your highness at some point, but I apologize for suddenly barging in like this.”<br> “Not at all. It’s okay.”<br> “Your highness, you truly are as wise and benevolent as I've heard.”<br> “Hahaha! Duke Fredo, you are the one who seems quite wise.”</p> 
 <p>‘Oh?’</p> 
 <p>Cale looked toward the black bird and Alberu who were chatting peacefully with each other in disbelief.<br> Alberu noticed Cale's gaze and started to speak.</p> 
 <p>“Little brother, have you ever thought about learning such cool etiquette like Duke Fredo's?”</p> 
 <p>‘What nonsense is this?’</p> 
 <p>Cale just said whatever came to mind.</p> 
 <p>“I plan on being a slacker, so I don't think I’ll have anywhere to use that etiquette even if I learned them.”<br> “Ah.”</p> 
 <p>Alberu sighed.<br> Cale found Alberu’s pitying gaze to be odd.</p> 
 <p>‘…Why is he looking at me like that?’</p> 
 <p>Although he didn't know the reason, it made him feel extremely iffy that Cale slightly started to frown as he looked at Alberu.<br> Alberu shook his head and then started to speak toward Duke Fredo.</p> 
 <p>“Based on what I heard, Duke Fredo was unconscious. Are you okay?”</p> 
 <p>Smile.</p> 
 <p>Alberu started to smile.<br> He had a sharp gaze toward Duke Fredo as if they had not been speaking peacefully to each other at all.<br> The black bird who received his observing gaze directly shared his astonishment.</p> 
 <p>“Hooo. You've heard about my condition.”</p> 
 <p>Swish.</p> 
 <p>The black bird turned toward Cale.<br> The black bird’s eyes flashed as they looked at him.</p> 
 <p>“I'm extremely curious as to how his highness knew about my condition. My current condition should have been a secret.”</p> 
 <p>Cale just shrugged his shoulders toward the black bird.</p> 
 <p>‘There’s no need to tell him that the Wind Elementals told me.’</p> 
 <p>He didn’t want to share that information with someone who was not his ally.<br> Duke Fredo seemed to notice this as he did not ask further.</p> 
 <p>Flutter.</p> 
 <p>He flapped his wings and flew up into the air.</p> 
 <p>“Your highness, if it is okay with you, may I have a conversation with young master Cale Henituse in secret?”<br> “Of course. Do whatever you need.”<br> “Thank you very much, your highness. I will come bade goodbye before I leave.”<br> “I understand.”</p> 
 <p>Cale observed the bird and the crown prince in a stiff position as he thought to himself.</p> 
 <p>‘They work well off each other.’</p> 
 <p>Cale chuckled and got up from his seat.</p> 
 <p>He was the one Duke Fredo wanted to chat with the most.<br> He had no reason to decline that conversation.<br> It was even better that he didn’t need to go looking for him.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go chat in my bedroom.”</p> 
 <p>They couldn't talk in the reception room nor an office because this was the Stan Lord’s Castle.</p> 
 <p>“Sounds good.”</p> 
 <p>Duke Fredo happily left with Cale.<br> …While landing on Choi Han’s shoulder.</p> 
 <p>‘What the hell is he doing?’</p> 
 <p>Cale looked toward Duke Fredo who gracefully landed on Choi Han’s shoulder with shock.<br> Duke Fredo didn't care and patted Choi Han's shoulder with his foot before speaking in a satisfied voice.</p> 
 <p>“Mm. This shoulder is nice because it is the firmest. This is satisfactory.”</p> 
 <p>Cale could see Choi Han's pupils shaking after being taken back by this development.<br> Duke Fredo who did not notice this at all patted Choi Han’s shoulder with his feet again.</p> 
 <p>“Choi Han, you escort me.”</p> 
 <p>Cale could see something at that moment.</p> 
 <p>‘What is up with this bastard?’</p> 
 <p>He could tell that Choi Han was swearing in his head just by looking at his eyes.<br> Cale subconsciously took a step away from Choi Han and headed toward the bedroom door.</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Human!</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>Raon was invisible and right behind him.</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Is it okay for that fearless Vampire to move around like this after claiming to be unconscious?</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>‘I know, right?’</p> 
 <p>Cale kind of bowed toward Alberu who was waving his hand and grabbed the doorknob.</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Oh, human, also! You cannot get close to the God of Death at all! The God of Death seems to be cunning! Don’t worry, I won't let even a god get away with messing with you!</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>‘Oops. I forgot about the God of Death.’</p> 
 <p>Cale had forgotten about the God of Death issue because of Duke Fredo's sudden appearance.</p> 
 <p>Click.</p> 
 <p>Cale turned the doorknob and headed outside.<br> A couple of Royal Knights were standing a bit away while guarding the area around Alberu’s bedroom door. Cale greeted them before starting to walk toward his room.</p> 
 <p>“Young master-nim!”</p> 
 <p>He turned his head after hearing someone calling his name from behind him.<br> Cage walked out from behind Choi Han, who was walking with the black bird on his shoulder, and approached Cale.</p> 
 <p>She stood next to Cale and quietly whispered something in his ear.</p> 
 <p>“Young master-nim, is it fine to consider that you are declining the offer for sure?”</p> 
 <p>Cale answered sternly without even a second of hesitation.</p> 
 <p>“Yes.”</p> 
 <p>It was one thing to land a punch on the God of Death, but he did not want to move according to a god’s will.<br> Cage blinked a few times after hearing his response before mumbling to herself.</p> 
 <p>“Hmm, I don't know if he’ll listen. He’s a persistent god. He’s such a blockhead that you can't really talk to him.”</p> 
 <p>Cale flinched.</p> 
 <p>Cage who was mumbling to herself slowly looked up at Cale’s face and observed him.</p> 
 <p>Smile. </p> 
 <p>She then started to smile.</p> 
 <p>“I will figure out a way.”</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Human! Cage is smiling like when you and the crown prince are scamming someone! No, she’s smiling in an even scarier way!</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>That smile soon turned to her usual refreshing smile and she bowed to Cale.</p> 
 <p>“Then see you next time.”<br> “…Sure.”</p> 
 <p>Cale watched Cage leave in the opposite direction before his expression turned stiff.<br> He turned away from Cage and started to walk toward his room.</p> 
 <p>‘The God of Death…things are getting annoying.’</p> 
 <p>His expression continued to stiffen from the frustration he felt as he thought about his situation.</p> 
 <p>The invisible Raon and Choi Han… As well as Duke Fredo on Choi Han’s shoulder followed quietly behind Cale.<br> Cale’s group could no longer see the area around Alberu's bedroom.<br> There were many people who had watched them from the beginning.</p> 
 <p>“…Wasn't his expression too vicious?”</p> 
 <p>The voice of one of the knights in the hallway filled the area.</p> 
 <p>Peek peek.</p> 
 <p>The knights guarding the crown prince's room stopped looking solemn and serious and peeked at each other.</p> 
 <p>‘This is weird.’<br> ‘His expression…was very serious.’</p> 
 <p>The battle had ended.<br> But Cale Henituse, the person who could be said was the one to end the battle, had entered the crown prince's bedroom looking weak and down but left with a stiff and serious expression and headed somewhere.<br> His steps looked firm and urgent.</p> 
 <p>All of the knights had ominous feelings.<br> They were the ones who were responsible for guarding the crown prince and protecting the kingdom after all.<br> That was why they were worried that another war or something big would happen.</p> 
 <p>The Knight Captain was not there right now, so one of the knights cautiously started to ask.</p> 
 <p>“Do you think…something happened to young master Cale-nim?”</p> 
 <p>His sunbae knight let out a fake cough before adding on.</p> 
 <p>“Looks that way. He’s always working for the Roan Kingdom…he’s always busy and unable to rest.”</p> 
 <p>One of the quietest Knights started to speak at that moment.</p> 
 <p>“It might be for the entire world and not just the Roan Kingdom. Didn't you guys see it just now too?”</p> 
 <p>The knights all looked toward him as it was rare for him to speak.<br> He usually did not speak because he was a deep thinker.</p> 
 <p>“See what?”<br> “Young master Cale-nim chatting with someone.”</p> 
 <p>They recalled the person who had just whispered to Cale.</p> 
 <p>“…You mean the lady wearing the priestess robe?”<br> “Yes.”<br> “That madam-, isn’t she Lord Stan’s close friend?”</p> 
 <p>The knights had not reacted to her being here because they were clear about her identity.</p> 
 <p>“But that’s not it.”<br> "What do you mean?”<br> “I think I can answer that for you.”<br> “Hmm?”</p> 
 <p>The knight chatting with the quiet knight looked toward his hoobae knight who had been the first to speak.</p> 
 <p>Peek peek.</p> 
 <p>The hoobae knight looked around in order to make sure that they were the only ones there before he cautiously started to speak.<br> He needed to be even more cautious as this was the Stan Lord’s Castle and not the palace.</p> 
 <p>“The lady from earlier is indeed Lord Stan's close friend, however…”</p> 
 <p>Gulp.</p> 
 <p>He gulped and continued to speak.</p> 
 <p>“…She is also an excommunicated priestess of the Church of the God of Death.”</p> 
 <p>The knights who had been quietly listening to him reacted to that statement.</p> 
 <p>"Excommunicated?”<br> “The God of Death?”</p> 
 <p>It was because it was difficult and rare for a priestess to be excommunicated.</p> 
 <p>“Yes. She was excommunicated from the church of the God of Death, but you see…”</p> 
 <p>The important information was here.<br> The hoobae knight shared the story he had heard from his close friend who was a knight at the Stan Lord’s Castle.</p> 
 <p>"She was excommunicated, but the Church of the God of Death does not dare to touch her.”</p> 
 <p>He shared his thoughts.</p> 
 <p>“And based on what I've heard, that excommunicated priestess-nim can still use powers like the vow of death that the God of Death gives to his priests.”<br> “…How is that possible?”<br> “Exactly.”</p> 
 <p>Peek peek.</p> 
 <p>The knight looked around once more before continuing to speak.</p> 
 <p>“The fact that the church does not dare to touch that priestess-nim is because the God of Death still considers her to be his child. Such a person came urgently looking for young master Cale-nim. She then chatted so closely with him.”</p> 
 <p>The knight known for being silent started to speak again.</p> 
 <p>“Especially right after that evil White Star bastard told us that thing about young master Cale-nim.”</p> 
 <p>A priestess who was excommunicated but still remained the child of a god.<br> That priestess urgently came looking for Cale and chatted so closely with him until just a moment ago.</p> 
 <p>Cale had turned stiff after that conversation.<br> The White Star had just said that Cale was someone who had received the will of a god.<br> Of course, the White Star did not say which god it was. He just considered Cale to be an envoy of a god.</p> 
 <p>Young master Cale was saying that that was not the case, but…</p> 
 <p>A scenario popped up in the knights’ minds.<br> They all subconsciously looked at each other.</p> 
 <p>“…Perhaps?”</p> 
 <p>The knights all looked toward the quiet Knight. He stood up straight after receiving their gazes and started to speak.</p> 
 <p>“I just shared my hypothesis.”</p> 
 <p>He then shut up again.<br> All of them shut up.<br> They felt as if they figured out something they were not supposed to know.</p> 
 <p>Silence filled the hallway once more.</p> 
 <hr> 
 <p>Cale closed his bedroom door and looked toward the center of the room.</p> 
 <p>“So, why did you come to find me?”</p> 
 <p>Flutter.</p> 
 <p>The black bird that elegantly started to flutter its wings on Choi Han’s shoulder approached Cale.<br> It then made eye contact with Cale once it was about a step away.</p> 
 <p>The bird’s beak opened again.</p> 
 <p>“My friend, it looks like you'll need to go to the Endable Kingdom with me.”</p> 
 <p>‘…Since when am I your friend?’</p> 
 <p>Cale was flabbergasted.</p>
