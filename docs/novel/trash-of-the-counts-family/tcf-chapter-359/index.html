 <p>“…You're going to go through all of these?”</p> 
 <p>The Mercenary King urgently chased behind Cale, who was heading toward the center of the area that was full of thousands of books. He seemed to be nervous.</p> 
 <p>“Cale, I remember what you told me when you made me the offer.”</p> 
 <p>Bud Illis recalled the things Cale told him the first time they met.</p> 
 <p>“You asked me to show you the Directory.”</p> 
 <p>The Directory was not a file that even the Mercenary King could easily show others. However, he still brought Cale here, even acting stealthily in the process.<br> There was a simple reason for it.</p> 
 <p>“You said you needed to know the White Star’s history.”</p> 
 <p>Cale turned his head and looked toward the Mercenary King.</p> 
 <p>The Mercenary King flinched.</p> 
 <p>It was because Cale’s eyes did not look human for a moment.</p> 
 <p>They were cold and emotionless. It was as if he was looking at an object.<br> However, those thoughts quickly disappeared once Cale started to speak.</p> 
 <p>Cale had not told the Mercenary King much information about the White Star. However, it was time to share some details.</p> 
 <p>“The White Star is a reincarnator who has gone through many lives for approximately 1,000 years.”</p> 
 <p>That was enough.<br> Cale confirmed the Mercenary King's expression changing before turning back around and heading toward the records.</p> 
 <p>Bud just blankly stared at Cale’s back.</p> 
 <p>Pat. Pat. </p> 
 <p>He only returned to his senses and started to speak after the ancient Dragon patted his shoulders before walking past him. The ancient Dragon was approaching Cale.</p> 
 <p>“…Eruhaben-nim, are you saying the White Star is someone who repeatedly died and was born again?”<br> “Yes. He reincarnated over and over.”</p> 
 <p>Eruhaben looked toward Cale who stopped in front of a desk and was looking around before continuing to speak.</p> 
 <p>“That is why we came here to look for records about him. He should have left traces throughout the Eastern and Western continents during his reincarnations.”</p> 
 <p>Bud quickly responded back.</p> 
 <p>“…There’s no way that we have no records on such a strong individual.”</p> 
 <p>However, Bud's lips opened and closed a few times without saying anything before he stopped hesitating and continued to speak.</p> 
 <p>“However, it is close to impossible to find traces of him in these tens of thousands of books.”</p> 
 <p>As the current Mercenary King, he had the most knowledge about these records than any other living being.</p> 
 <p>“Each book has hundreds of people listed in it. It is … Almost not realistic to go through hundreds of thousands of individuals.”</p> 
 <p>He peeked toward Ron Molan before continuing to speak.</p> 
 <p>“Of course, I have a good knowledge of all of the strong individuals in the past fifty years. Those are considered the, ‘currently recording,’ information.”</p> 
 <p>Ron Molan was an example of a strong individual from the Eastern continent whose traces had disappeared.<br> That was why the Mercenaries Guild was keeping his record under the, ‘currently recording,’ status.</p> 
 <p>“…Around two hundred years might be doable, but a thousand years is just-”<br> “Bud.”</p> 
 <p>Someone cut him off.<br> It was Cale.</p> 
 <p>"Where is the first-ever record?”</p> 
 <p>“Haaaaaaaaa.”</p> 
 <p>Bud sighed at Cale who seemed ready to start looking from the first-ever record. He quickly walked over to Cale.</p> 
 <p>“Cale, are you planning on spending the next few years in here? Hmm?”</p> 
 <p>Bud was getting frustrated.<br> He didn't understand why such a smart person would pick such a method.</p> 
 <p>“I'm sure it will be helpful to look up his past since the White Star is a reincarnator. However, there are 1,000 years worth of records.”</p> 
 <p>Bud picked up a book from the bookshelf and opened it up.</p> 
 <p>“It has each strong individual's birth, date, and general information about their lives. Furthermore, we also record the powers they use. Each book has hundreds of such records.”</p> 
 <p>Bud had felt like he was going to suffocate when he first became the Mercenary King and came in here.<br> He was overwhelmed by the information.</p> 
 <p>At the same time, it helped him understand how the Mercenaries Guild was able to remain a strong force in the Eastern continent without having any land of their own.</p> 
 <p>They had records that were just as valuable as land.<br> In some aspects, this was the scariest power.<br> That was the overwhelming nature of these records.</p> 
 <p>Bud started to point out the issues in Cale's plans one by one.</p> 
 <p>“Even if you start reading from the first record, it would be difficult to remember the first strong individual in the book by the time you are only a third of the way through it.”</p> 
 <p>Even a person with a good memory would find it difficult to remember over thirty people’s information.<br> Just looking through three of the books would make it confusing to remember which information belonged to whom.</p> 
 <p>“Furthermore, how do you plan on finding traces of the White Star? How will you be able to tell which strong individual was the White Star's first incarnation?”</p> 
 <p>Bud had smelled quite a number of scents coming from the White Star.<br> He had a variety of ancient powers like Cale such that it was difficult to accurately pinpoint everything.</p> 
 <p>“Plus, Cale, don't you need to quickly capture the White Star? What you are trying to do will require a bunch of people working nonstop for months, no, years to achieve.”</p> 
 <p>It was impossible to just read and remember all of these records.<br> You had to divide up the task with others.</p> 
 <p>Bud then said the thing that confused him the most.</p> 
 <p>“I'm sure you know about this fact more than anybody else. So why are you doing this?”</p> 
 <p>Cale picked up the book that Bud pulled out and turned the pages.</p> 
 <p>Shhh.</p> 
 <p>The pages that were stiff like new books thanks to the preservation magic quickly turned one by one.<br> Bud who was watching this could not help but speak again.</p> 
 <p>“Cale Henituse, this-”<br> “It’s fine for me.”</p> 
 <p>Bud flinched. </p> 
 <p>He was not the only one. <br> The rest of the group who were busy looking around at the area focused on Cale.<br> Bud asked the calm Cale a question.</p> 
 <p>“…What?”</p> 
 <p>‘What did he just say?<br> He is capable of doing what I just talked about?<br> But how?<br> …I don’t smell such an ability on him.’</p> 
 <p>Bud looked at Cale smile as Cale stopped looking at the book and turned back toward him.</p> 
 <p>“First, one week.”</p> 
 <p>Cale did not plan on staying here for a long time either.</p> 
 <p>“I will find the first within that time.”</p> 
 <p>The strong individual he believed to be the first incarnation of the White Star.<br> If he finds that person's birth and death, then he just needed to look for the next information based on the time of death.</p> 
 <p>Cale's group knew about the White Star’s Dragon Slayer powers and ancient powers. Of course, Bud did not know the details because none of them had told him yet.<br> Cale’s group had a decent amount of knowledge on the White Star’s powers.<br> That was why it was possible to find the first incarnation.</p> 
 <p>“…How? How will you find the first incarnation?”</p> 
 <p>Cale chuckled while looking at Bud who was standing there with a blank expression on his face.<br> It was similar to the expressions people had when Kim Rok Soo had first awakened.</p> 
 <p>Kill or be killed.<br> Live or let live.</p> 
 <p>The war between monsters and humans.<br> The war between humans and humans.</p> 
 <p>It was a world full of destruction because of all of that.</p> 
 <p>Kim Rok Soo had been determined to have awakened an ability that was useless in such a world, an ability that would only help him in a peaceful world.</p> 
 <p>However, that power allowed Kim Rok Soo to keep living without dying.<br> He confidently answered the confused Bud’s question.</p> 
 <p>“Take a look.”</p> 
 <p>He then asked.</p> 
 <p>“Where is it?”</p> 
 <p>Bud stood there quietly for a while before pointing to a location.</p> 
 <p>“The innermost shelf. The first book on the bottom left.”</p> 
 <p>Cale walked toward the location Bud had pointed out.</p> 
 <p>“That book is the first record.”</p> 
 <p>He heard Bud’s voice coming from behind him as he pulled out the first book from the bookshelf. He then started to turn the pages.</p> 
 <p>Flip, flip.</p> 
 <p>Only the sound of pages turning could be heard.<br> Cale just stood there reading.</p> 
 <p>“…Ho.”</p> 
 <p>Bud let out a gasp at Cale's actions. However, he made eye contact with the others before walking toward the innermost bookshelf as well.<br> He needed to help Cale.<br> He couldn’t just stand there and do nothing.</p> 
 <p>However, the group of people heading toward Cale had to stop.<br> Bud was the first to stop.<br> Next were Eruhaben, Choi Han, Ron, and Beacrox.<br> Even the children averaging nine-years-old flinched.</p> 
 <p>Flip, flip, flip.</p> 
 <p>They just heard the sound of pages turning.<br> That was why they felt that something was off.</p> 
 <p>Flip, flip, flip.</p> 
 <p>It was quiet around Cale.<br> He was just quietly turning the pages.</p> 
 <p>That was the weird part.</p> 
 <p>Bud had no choice but to ask.</p> 
 <p>“…What is up with his speed?”</p> 
 <p>Flip. Flip.</p> 
 <p>At first, it didn't seem very odd.<br> Cale was turning pages at a reasonable pace.</p> 
 <p>‘…It was as if he was reading a novel.’</p> 
 <p>Bud then realized that it had been weird from the beginning.</p> 
 <p>Flip. Flip. Flip.</p> 
 <p>Cale was slowly turning the pages faster and faster. It seemed as if he was just taking a peek before turning the page.<br> Bud even had this kind of thought.</p> 
 <p>‘Is he not thoroughly going through and remembering the details about each strong individual?<br> Is he just quickly skimming through?’</p> 
 <p>However, the feeling Cale was giving off did not seem that way.<br> He seemed to be thoroughly reading.</p> 
 <p>“Cale.”</p> 
 <p>Cale raised his head after hearing someone calling his name.<br> The ancient Dragon observed Cale's eyes with an odd expression on his face. Cale's expression was same, but his eyes felt cold.<br> The ancient Dragon could not ask many questions. He used his memory of everything Cale had done as the basis to ask.</p> 
 <p>“You're remembering all of it, right?”</p> 
 <p>‘You're not just skimming it, you actually remember the information, right?’</p> 
 <p>Cale answered the ancient Dragon's question.</p> 
 <p>“Of course.”</p> 
 <p>Cale answered in his usual nonchalant way before resuming reading. His reddish brown eyes looked at the text inside the book.</p> 
 <p>Flip.</p> 
 <p>He turned a page.<br> The information on the page became recorded in his mind. The speed continued to increase.</p> 
 <p>Bud could only quietly watch Cale.</p> 
 <p>‘…What a scary ability.’</p> 
 <p>He really thought that this ability was scary.<br> It was different than the fancy magic, destructive aura, and even the different types of ancient powers. This ability was something that was not visible.</p> 
 <p>It was so unnoticeable that you would not even realize that he was using an ability if you did not look closely.</p> 
 <p>It was not an ability that could kill someone, but Bud thought that this ability was really the one that would make it easy to kill or control someone.</p> 
 <p>Everything would be recorded in the user’s mind.</p> 
 <p>Bud could only gulp and watch.<br> However, he soon heard someone walking.</p> 
 <p>“Cale-nim.”</p> 
 <p>Cale raised his head after hearing the cautious calling. Choi Han was looking at him.</p> 
 <p>“What is it?”<br> “I wish to help.”</p> 
 <p>Choi Han smiled awkwardly at Cale who was looking at him and continued to speak.</p> 
 <p>“Of course, I am a slow reader and my memory is not that good, but I thought I could still help.”</p> 
 <p>Cale recalled some memories of his past.</p> 
 <p>‘Team leader-nim, shall I help?’<br> ‘Isn’t it time to go home?’<br> ‘Nah, it’s okay.’<br> ‘Like hell it’s okay. Isn’t your kid waiting for you at home? Go home.’<br> ‘But…’<br> ‘It's fastest and most accurate for me to do it. You don't need to do this part.’</p> 
 <p>He moved the conversation he had with one of his subordinates to a corner of his mind as he raised his hand.<br> He then pointed to the second bookshelf.</p> 
 <p>“I think it would be good to look through there.”</p> 
 <p>It was rare for Cale to not give detailed orders.<br> However, Choi Han smiled and walked over to the second bookshelf. Eruhaben and Beacrox followed behind him.</p> 
 <p>Ron stood next to Cale and just looked at him.<br> Ron's gaze made Cale subconsciously start to speak.</p> 
 <p>“…What is it? Are you shocked that I have an ability like this?”</p> 
 <p>Cale closed his mouth after saying that. He was thinking that he said something he should not have said.<br> He heard Ron responding to him.</p> 
 <p>“Well, I'm sure you just hid it, young master-nim.”</p> 
 <p>Ron had a benign smile on his face as he continued to speak.</p> 
 <p>“It’s not like you told us how you gathered all of those ancient powers either.”</p> 
 <p>The shield, the fiery thunderbolt, the Super Rock, etc.</p> 
 <p>Cale had never explained to the group how he had gained all of these ancient powers. He always just disappeared before returning with an extra ancient power.</p> 
 <p>Cale had a random thought that it would be frustrating to have a group member like himself. The old man continued to speak as Cale found it even harder to say anything after having that thought.</p> 
 <p>“Looking at the books like the others is not my task.”</p> 
 <p>Ron continued to speak to the twenty years old Cale who was quietly looking at him.</p> 
 <p>“I am your servant, young master-nim. Tending to your needs by your side is my role.”</p> 
 <p>Ron then just quietly stood next to Cale.<br> Cale quietly looked at Ron for a moment before turning back to the book.</p> 
 <p>“…I guess that is your role.”</p> 
 <p>Cale also realized what his role was as well.</p> 
 <p>Flip. Flip.</p> 
 <p>He was quickly turning pages as he heard another voice.</p> 
 <p>“I, the great and mighty Raon Miru can read quickly! My memory is good as well! I am smart, great, and mighty! That is why I will do it too!”<br> “…I…I learned how to read from Hans and grandpa Ron! I’m going to do it too!”<br> “I'm already reading one!”<br> “Noona, you really are amazing!”</p> 
 <p>Cale chuckled while listening to the children averaging nine-years-old.</p> 
 <p>However, the large records library soon became quiet.</p> 
 <p>Flip. Flip.</p> 
 <p>Only the sound of pages being turned could be heard.<br> Cale then heard Beacrox ask a question.</p> 
 <p>“What exactly are we looking for?”</p> 
 <p>Cale thought about the White Star.</p> 
 <p>“Gather any record on strong individuals who use the Dragon Slayer's powers or ancient powers.”</p> 
 <p>A response came from someone else.</p> 
 <p>“Is that power the Dragon Slayer’s power?”</p> 
 <p>It was Bud. He touched his nose as he walked over to the second bookshelf.</p> 
 <p>“The White Star had a unique scent along with the scent of ancient powers. Then I should help as well.”</p> 
 <p>Bud thought about the information he gathered on the White Star through his scent and turned a page.</p> 
 <p>However, there was a unique sound through the process.</p> 
 <p>Flip, flip, flip.</p> 
 <p>It was the sound of pages turning extremely quickly.<br> Bud imagined Cale becoming a living record as he focused on reading the record in front of him.</p> 
 <hr> 
 <p>‘Mm.’</p> 
 <p>Ron groaned internally.</p> 
 <p>This was an area where the temperature was maintained all the time.<br> There should be no reason for someone to sweat.</p> 
 <p>He moved his hand.<br> The handkerchief in his hand landed on someone's forehead.</p> 
 <p>‘…Why is he sweating so much?’</p> 
 <p>Ron Molan could see Cale who was sweating profusely.<br> Cale's face had become extremely red as well.</p> 
 <p>The records storage area was chilly, but Cale was heating up as if he was sick.<br> However, he did not stop and continued to record the information.</p> 
 <p>There were close to ten thousand record books behind his back as if they were his footprints.</p>
