 <p>A dull noise echoed in the hall along with the black smoke.</p> 
 <p>Boom! Boom!</p> 
 <p>The two people’s bodies slammed into the wall.</p> 
 <p>“Ugh! Why did you suddenly use your wind, w, what the…?!”</p> 
 <p>Cotton groaned at the sudden impact and her eyes opened wide as she tried to look at Cale.</p> 
 <p>Her eyes were focused on the black smoke on top of the platform.</p> 
 <p>The black smoke was spreading thick and quickly, looking as if it could fill the whole area in an instant.</p> 
 <p>“Damn it.”</p> 
 <p>As for the other person who also crashed into the wall… Cale glared at Gersey who was on the other side of the black door.</p> 
 <p>“I was almost tricked.”</p> 
 <p>He then looked back at the black smoke.</p> 
 <p>This black smoke must have been the way to provide the feed to the monsters.</p> 
 <p>“It can't get out of the platform.”</p> 
 <p>The black smoke only roamed around the platform and did not flow out of it.</p> 
 <p>Cotton walked up to the platform and tapped on the air.</p> 
 <p>Tang tang.</p> 
 <p>“It looks like there is a transparent barrier separating the platform and the area underneath the platform once the black smoke came out.”</p> 
 <p>She roamed around the platform and nodded her head.</p> 
 <p>“I guess it needs to be like this so that Gersey can provide the feed and then he and his subordinates could safely get out.”<br> “But doesn’t it seem like it would be impossible to steal the sculptures like this?”</p> 
 <p>Cale got up and headed next to Cotton. He was now underneath the platform.</p> 
 <p>Gersey who was outside the black door could not see him.</p> 
 <p>However, Gersey clicked his tongue as if he could see what was going on. He had more blood flowing out from his mouth than Eruhaben did.</p> 
 <p>“How disappointing. I guess I have no choice but to overdo it a bit.”<br> “Hehehe.”</p> 
 <p>He turned his head after hearing someone laugh.</p> 
 <p>Bud was laughing.</p> 
 <p>“Are you sad that you failed to give the feed to them?”</p> 
 <p>The corners of Gersey’s lips started to go up.</p> 
 <p>“But thanks to that, you are unable to steal nor destroy the sculptures.”<br> “…What do you mean?”</p> 
 <p>Bud who didn't know about the black smoke and the transparent barrier started to frown while Gersey laughed and turned around.</p> 
 <p>“Ah, you're here, your majesty?”</p> 
 <p>Eruhaben’s eyes started to sink.</p> 
 <p>The White Star was walking over in the distance.</p> 
 <p>He spoke to Bud in his mind while Gersey greeted the White Star.</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>This is bad. Looks like we need to escape.</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>Bud silently nodded his head.</p> 
 <p>He heard the White Star's voice at that moment.</p> 
 <p>“It’s so noisy starting the first day of the festival.”</p> 
 <p>Eruhaben retorted back.</p> 
 <p>“It’s only loud because you are making it that way, isn’t it?”<br> “Hahaha, is that so? Well, it looks like I need to get rid of you first before Cale Henituse can steal those things.”</p> 
 <p>Chhhhhhhhhh-</p> 
 <p>A red sword shot out from the White Star’s hand.</p> 
 <p>“I will destroy the wall, your majesty.”</p> 
 <p>Gersey grabbed his fan and charged toward the gold wall.</p> 
 <p>Tatap!</p> 
 <p>He lightly kicked off the ground, jumped up into the air, and struck down with the hand holding the fan.</p> 
 <p>The fan touched the gold wall.</p> 
 <p>It was at that moment.</p> 
 <p>Baaaaaaaaaang-!</p> 
 <p>The fan started to shake.</p> 
 <p>“Ugh!”</p> 
 <p>Gersey stumbled as he landed on the ground.</p> 
 <p>The large cave started to shake.</p> 
 <p>“What the hell!”</p> 
 <p>That shaking had started from inside the black door.</p> 
 <p>Gersey instantly thought about something.</p> 
 <p>Based on Cale Henituse's past actions…</p> 
 <p>Is he using his ancient powers to destroy it-?!”</p> 
 <p>He might have used his ancient powers to their limits.</p> 
 <p>Would the barrier be able to withstand his attack?</p> 
 <p>Was he planning on destroying this whole cave at the same time?</p> 
 <p>“Chief Priest!”</p> 
 <p>He heard the White Star scold him at that moment.</p> 
 <p>"Can’t you even feel what power it is?!”</p> 
 <p>‘Power?’</p> 
 <p>Gersey looked back toward the black door.</p> 
 <p>There was a gap on the door, but it was not wide enough to see everything.</p> 
 <p>However, he could feel the aura flowing out through the door.</p> 
 <p>“…P, perhaps-”<br> “That ‘perhaps’ seems to be the case.”</p> 
 <p>Gersey turned pale after hearing the White Star's response.</p> 
 <p>“W, why is that honorable power coming right now-”</p> 
 <p>It was no longer an issue of their big plan being destroyed.</p> 
 <p>The honorable power had responded to Cale.</p> 
 <p>‘Why? That power should not be able to respond to Cale Henituse?’</p> 
 <p>Gersey's mind started to turn white.</p> 
 <p>It looked like both their big plan and the current situation might end up twisted.</p> 
 <p>“I'll go first.”</p> 
 <p>The White Star walked past Gersey who was somewhat out of it and swung his sword toward the gold wall.</p> 
 <p>He started to frown.</p> 
 <p>‘I never expected that power to respond to Cale Henituse!’</p> 
 <p>His relaxed expression had turned urgent.</p> 
 <p>That was why he was using the sword at full power.</p> 
 <p>Slash.</p> 
 <p>The wall was easily split.</p> 
 <p>“Ugh!”</p> 
 <p>Eruhaben coughed up blood and moved back.</p> 
 <p>Thankfully, he had been preparing to escape, so he was not injured too much from the wall breaking.</p> 
 <p>However, he had no choice but to open his eyes wide and turn around.</p> 
 <p>‘How could such an enormous amount of power-!’</p> 
 <p>He could feel a strong power behind his back.</p> 
 <p>“Fuck!”</p> 
 <p>He also heard the White Star’s angry shout.</p> 
 <p>Eruhaben could see the black door and the wall exploding.</p> 
 <p>Baaaaang!</p> 
 <p>“Ugh!”</p> 
 <p>Cotton’s body was curled up as she was flung out of there.</p> 
 <p>“Shit!”</p> 
 <p>Bud caught Cotton as he shouted in shock.</p> 
 <p>"What the hell happened?!”<br> “T, the barrier broke and a weird power- a scary power-”</p> 
 <p>Bud was about to urge her to respond until he realized that her body was shaking.</p> 
 <p>He quickly looked toward where the door had been.</p> 
 <p>Bud subconsciously started to speak.</p> 
 <p>“…What the?”</p> 
 <p>He then took a step back.</p> 
 <p>He had chills all over his body.</p> 
 <p>It was a natural reaction.</p> 
 <p>“Cale!”</p> 
 <p>He could see Eruhaben stumbling as he charged forward.</p> 
 <p>Bud had never seen Eruhaben moving so urgently before.</p> 
 <p>“Damn it! No!”</p> 
 <p>The White Star was also shouting as he urgently rushed forward and passed Eruhaben.</p> 
 <p>His face showed both anger and anxiety.</p> 
 <p>‘Ah!’</p> 
 <p>Bud finally thought to look for Cale. Cotton had been flung out, but Cale had not.</p> 
 <p>He overcame the fear that was filling his body and looked back toward that direction.</p> 
 <p>He saw Cale there.</p> 
 <p>Cale had plopped on the ground right in front of the thing that was giving him such terrible fear.</p> 
 <p>“…What the hell is this?”</p> 
 <p>Cale’s eyes opened wide as he sat there on the ground.</p> 
 <p>He had not been flung out with that explosion just now, but he was on the ground because he fell down.</p> 
 <p>He lowered his head.</p> 
 <p>‘What’s going on?’</p> 
 <p>His whole body was shaking.</p> 
 <p>The unranked monster that had killed all his teammates… A pressure that was much worse than when he had gone up against that monster was overwhelming him.</p> 
 <p>Cale lifted his head.</p> 
 <p>The thing giving him that fear was right in front of him.</p> 
 <p>It was a black hand.</p> 
 <p>The hand was so large that it could almost touch the ceiling of the hall.</p> 
 <p>What could be going on?</p> 
 <p>‘What is happening all of a sudden?’</p> 
 <p>Cale recalled his actions just now.</p> 
 <p>‘All I did was get close to the platform.’</p> 
 <p>All he did was move toward Cotton who was observing the black smoke and the transparent barrier.</p> 
 <p>But the black smoke inside the transparent barrier… That had suddenly disappeared and a large black hand shot up from the platform.</p> 
 <p>The power of that hand made the transparent barrier explode.</p> 
 <p>And Cale was looking at that black hand right now.</p> 
 <p>The eight sculptures?</p> 
 <p>He wasn’t paying them any attention right now.</p> 
 <p>He thought it was weird that they didn't have a scratch on them after such a large explosion, but he had no time to look into that right now.</p> 
 <p>Boom. Boom. Boom.</p> 
 <p>His heart was beating as if it wanted to explode and he had chills all over his body.</p> 
 <p>Kiiiiiiiiiiiiiii-</p> 
 <p>The black hand started to move while making that odd noise.</p> 
 <p>The palm stopped in front of Cale.</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>You disturbed my slumber.</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>‘What?’</p> 
 <p>Before Cale could even think about the meaning behind those words…</p> 
 <p>“Cale! Dodge!”</p> 
 <p>Cale's mind was filled by a voice that seemed to come from the black hand as Eruhaben shouted.</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Here is another punk who has found a way out of god’s hand and escaped his fate.</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>The black hand reached out and surrounded Cale while making an eerie noise.</p> 
 <p>Cale had instantly fallen into darkness.</p> 
 <hr> 
 <p>Bang, bang bang!</p> 
 <p>Lock had a confused expression after hearing someone banging on the door.</p> 
 <p>The Tiger warriors stationed outside would not knock like this.</p> 
 <p>"Who could it be?”</p> 
 <p>Lock debated whether he should open the door or not. He wondered if he should call the adults who were all gathered in the strategy room.</p> 
 <p>He heard a voice from the other side of the door at that moment.</p> 
 <p>“Please open the door!”</p> 
 <p>‘Huh?’</p> 
 <p>He recognized the voice.</p> 
 <p>It made sense why the Tiger warriors would have let this person through.</p> 
 <p>Lock quickly opened the door as he was relieved that it was someone he knew and welcomed the person.</p> 
 <p>“Cage-nim!”<br> “Huff. Huff. Huff.”</p> 
 <p>Cage was outside the door trying to catch her breath.</p> 
 <p>“It’s been so long!”</p> 
 <p>Lock warmly welcomed her but Cage didn’t even respond to his greeting as she urgently rushed into the black castle.</p> 
 <p>“Did something-”</p> 
 <p>Lock was trying to ask what was going on in shock before stiffening up after seeing what, no, who, was in Cage’s hand.</p> 
 <p>“W, wait- this person is?”</p> 
 <p>Lock who barely managed to get some words out looked toward the person who was being dragged by the collar.</p> 
 <p>“It’s been a while.”</p> 
 <p>This person was Saint Jack who looked as if he didn’t know what to do.</p> 
 <p>“I was suddenly dragged here and I don't even know wh-”<br> "Dragon!”</p> 
 <p>Saint Jack gave an awkward greeting, but… His greeting was drowned out by Cage’s shout.</p> 
 <p>Cage looked toward Lock and started to speak.</p> 
 <p>“Where is the Dragon? The Dragon?!”<br> “Excuse me?”</p> 
 <p>"A Dragon that can cast long-distance teleportation! Or at least Miss Rosalyn! No, it needs to be a Dragon, a Dragon!”<br> “Just what-”<br> “Young master Cale was cut!”<br> “Excuse me?”</p> 
 <p>Lock became anxious after suddenly hearing her mention Cale but Cage looked around as if things were urgent before running toward the stairs.</p> 
 <p>Lock followed behind her as Cage continued to speak.</p> 
 <p>“You know about the vow of death, right?”</p> 
 <p>Cage continued to look around as if she couldn't even see Lock who was anxiously following behind her and then resumed speaking.</p> 
 <p>She seemed to be looking for someone.</p> 
 <p>“Young master Cale and I made a vow of death, you know? There’s a power you feel gathering around your hand when you make a vow. It is the power that lets you know whether that person kept or broke the vow.”</p> 
 <p>It was the eerie feeling that seeped into the bodies of the people making the vow of death.</p> 
 <p>"But that was just cut off.”<br> “Really?!”</p> 
 <p>Jack who had been dragged here without knowing why looked toward her in shock.</p> 
 <p>However, Cage didn’t respond to his question and just continued to speak.</p> 
 <p>“There should be someone else who is feeling this right now. He should be feeling that something is weird.”</p> 
 <p>Screeeech.</p> 
 <p>They then heard a door opening on the second floor.</p> 
 <p>Lock turned toward the door.</p> 
 <p>Choi Han was walking out of the strategy room with a confused yet serious expression.</p> 
 <p>‘Didn’t hyung say that he had a lot of things to do?’</p> 
 <p>Choi Han who said he had important business to take care of was coming out with a serious expression before finishing his work.</p> 
 <p>"Ah, Miss Cage!”</p> 
 <p>He looked extremely happy to see Cage. It was as if he had found the person who could answer his question for him.</p> 
 <p>Choi Han stepped onto the stairs and walked toward her.</p> 
 <p>“Miss Cage, when did you get here? You see, umm, I made a vow of death with Cale-nim once-”<br> “The presence that entered your body when you made the vow disappeared, right?”</p> 
 <p>Choi Han flinched and looked at her.</p> 
 <p>Cage let go of Saint Jack's collar and continued to speak.</p> 
 <p>“People who make a vow of death are able to tell whether the vow was kept or broken by that power in their body.”</p> 
 <p>Death was the result if the vow was broken.</p> 
 <p>The presence inside the body would tell the other person that the vow was broken and that the other party was dead.</p> 
 <p>“But there are times the presence itself disappears from a person's body. That means that the vow of death is cut.”</p> 
 <p>Cage slowly walked over to Choi Han.</p> 
 <p>Her voice echoed through the staircase.</p> 
 <p>“There’s only one reason that a vow of death would be cut.”</p> 
 <p>Her face stiffened.</p> 
 <p>“That is when the vow becomes useless.”</p>
