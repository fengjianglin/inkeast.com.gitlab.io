 <p>“Gasp.”</p> 
 <p>Alberu sat up as soon as he took a breath.</p> 
 <p>He could see someone looking at him.</p> 
 <p>“…Ca…ge?”<br> “Yes, it is me, your highness.”</p> 
 <p>Jack and Cage were looking at him with nervous gazes from the other side of the couch Alberu had been lying on.</p> 
 <p>Alberu slowly looked around.</p> 
 <p>“…This is driving me crazy.”</p> 
 <p>Jack and Cage flinched after hearing the first words he said after waking up, but Alberu did not have time to focus on them.</p> 
 <p>He had woken up while he was fighting.</p> 
 <p>He had just been biting monsters apart in the body of a monster named the Dark Tiger until he opened his eyes only to suddenly find himself back here.</p> 
 <p>Sunlight was coming in through the tent entrance.</p> 
 <p>The sunlight was red.</p> 
 <p>Cage quietly started to speak.</p> 
 <p>“It is evening now, your highness.”<br> “It’s already that late?”</p> 
 <p>Alberu thought for a moment and mumbled to himself.</p> 
 <p>“…Two times as fast? Or is it three?”<br> “Excuse me?”<br> “It’s nothing.”</p> 
 <p>He shook his head at Cage's question. Alberu then noticed the curiosity behind the two priests’ eyes as they looked at him.</p> 
 <p>‘I'm sure they want to know how Cale and Choi Han are doing.’</p> 
 <p>Alberu looked down toward his stomach.</p> 
 <p>The half-black-half-white video communication device was sitting there.</p> 
 <p>He opened his mouth to speak.</p> 
 <p>“Has nothing else happened while I was sleeping?”<br> “Yes, your highness. There wasn’t even a call to the emergency line because you prepared everything prior to falling asleep.”<br> “That’s a relief.”</p> 
 <p>Cage and Jack carefully observed the calmly responding Alberu.</p> 
 <p>He was calm, but his body was covered in sweat.</p> 
 <p>That was why Cage had wondered whether she should wake him up prior to the discussed time.</p> 
 <p>They did not do so as he looked peaceful other than the fact that he was sweating so much.</p> 
 <p>“…Your highness. The contents of the deal-”<br> “Hold on.”</p> 
 <p>He opened his hand toward Cage to stop her from speaking.</p> 
 <p>The two priests didn’t know because they were faced away from it, but there was a small amount of red sunset coming in from the tent entrance.</p> 
 <p>It was obvious what that meant.</p> 
 <p>“Please come in, Raon-nim.”</p> 
 <p>He couldn't see Raon but the entrance flap lifted a little more.</p> 
 <p>“Meeeeeow.”<br> “Meeow!”</p> 
 <p>Two kittens walked in first and then the tent entrance was tightly closed before the young black Dragon revealed himself.</p> 
 <p>"Crown prince!”<br> “Yes, Raon-nim.”</p> 
 <p>Raon, On, and Hong.</p> 
 <p>The three of the slightly lifted Alberu's tent entrance flap every so often to signal whether it was okay for them to enter.</p> 
 <p>Even though Ron and Beacrox were taking care of the three of them, they were both busy managing the Molan household and taking care of things here.</p> 
 <p>Maybe that was the reason…</p> 
 <p>Or maybe it was for cookies…</p> 
 <p>It might even be because they wanted to hear some news about Cale and Choi Han, but…</p> 
 <p>The three of them came to look for Alberu every so often.</p> 
 <p>“Hey, crown prince! Are you sick?”<br> “Oh no, it's bad if he gets sick, nya!”<br> “…He needs to rest, nya, it’s probably because he hasn’t been able to rest, nya.”</p> 
 <p>These three didn’t find it difficult to talk to Alberu.</p> 
 <p>Maybe it was because they've seen him frequently since they were young.</p> 
 <p>‘No. It's because they’re like Cale.’</p> 
 <p>These three were probably imitating Cale who acted rudely around him all the time.</p> 
 <p>The corners of Alberu’s lips went up just a bit.</p> 
 <p>“I'm okay, Raon-nim.”<br> “Really?”<br> “Of course, Raon-nim. In fact, I'm doing quite well.”</p> 
 <p>Alberu started to think while looking at the young Dragon and the young Cats who seemed relieved after hearing what he just said.</p> 
 <p>‘Do I tell them or not?’</p> 
 <p>Would he tell them about Cale and Choi Han, or would he remain silent? Alberu was debating what to do.</p> 
 <p>But he didn't need to think for long.</p> 
 <p>‘Your highness. No, hyung-nim.’<br> ‘What is it?’</p> 
 <p>He recalled a short portion of the conversation he had with Cale while they were moving.</p> 
 <p>‘Hyung-nim, you’ll keep coming and going to see me, right?’<br> ‘Yes?’<br> ‘Then it is probably best not to tell them everything and instead just give them a brief positive explanation. Keep things positive, you know? It’s a simple request, right?”<br> ‘…You motherfucker. That's difficult to do.’</p> 
 <p>Alberu started to speak.</p> 
 <p>“Thanks to a deal I made with the Sun God earlier, I am now able to chat with Cale Henituse every so often.”</p> 
 <p>Raon’s round eyes opened wide.</p> 
 <p>Hong who was putting his paw into the cookie basket stopped moving while On looked frozen stiff as she was looking at Alberu.</p> 
 <p>Saint Jack urgently started to speak at that moment.</p> 
 <p>“Your highness. If you tell them about all of that-”<br> “It’s okay to tell them.”</p> 
 <p>Alberu confidently responded.</p> 
 <p>“It’s okay since he’s doing well.”</p> 
 <p>His expression and tone… Everything was calm and confident.</p> 
 <p>Maybe that was the reason…</p> 
 <p>“He also asked if you, Raon-nim, and On, and Hong were doing well. He asked if you were eating properly.”</p> 
 <p>The children averaging nine-years-old gathered together before their expressions brightened.</p> 
 <p>Cage, who also looked much better, started to speak.</p> 
 <p>“I, is he really fine?”<br> “Yes. You don’t need to worry.”</p> 
 <p>There was a small smile on Alberu’s face as he responded without any hesitation.</p> 
 <p>Alberu's gentle expression made everybody look even more relieved.</p> 
 <p>“Hey crown prince, crown prince!”<br> “Yes, Raon-nim.”<br> “Can I tell grandpa Ron and Beacrox?”</p> 
 <p>Alberu gently nodded his head.</p> 
 <p>“Of course, but please just quietly tell Ron Molan and bring Beacrox and Ron over here. I think I’ll need to explain it to the two of them.”<br> “I got it!”<br> “Oh, and please don't tell the others about it yet. I'll call them over separately and tell them myself.”<br> “I got it, crown prince!”</p> 
 <p>Raon looked at On who nodded her head and quickly headed toward the tent entrance with Hong and Raon.</p> 
 <p>On then suddenly stopped, turned around and bowed toward the crown prince.</p> 
 <p>“Thank you very much, your highness.”</p> 
 <p>Alberu's eyes opened wide.</p> 
 <p>She always spoke informally and added, ‘nya,’ so he thought that was her style, but she seemed quite mature just now.</p> 
 <p>“Ah! I’m thankful too, crown prince!”<br> “I'm thankful, nya! I'll pay you back for it, nya!”</p> 
 <p>Alberu gently responded after hearing Raon and Hong as well.</p> 
 <p>“No, it was nothing. I didn’t do much, Raon-nim.”</p> 
 <p>The children averaging nine-years-old looked even more relieved after seeing his demeanor and energetically exited the tent. They seemed excited that they had a mission to complete for the first time in a long while.</p> 
 <p>Alberu quietly observed them before turning toward Cage and Jack.</p> 
 <p>“I hope that you two could bring some people over as well, priest-nims.”<br> “Ah, of course!”</p> 
 <p>Saint Jack urgently jumped up from his seat. He had a bright expression on his face.</p> 
 <p>On the other hand, Cage’s expression that had been bright until a moment ago seemed a bit odd.</p> 
 <p>“…Who should we bring over?”</p> 
 <p>Alberu started to speak to respond to her question.</p> 
 <p>“Please bring Miss Rosalyn. Ah, Saint-nim, could you please bring your sister?”<br> “Yes, sir! Of course. I will go and quickly bring Hannah over.”<br> “That’s wonderful. Thank you very much. It looks like we will all need to have our first meeting in a long while.”</p> 
 <p>Saint Jack slightly bowed to Cage and Alberu and headed out of the tent.</p> 
 <p>Cage slowly followed behind him. She stopped at the entrance once Jack left and turned around to look at Alberu.</p> 
 <p>“Your highness.”</p> 
 <p>Cage hesitated for a moment before continuing to speak.</p> 
 <p>“I tend to be pretty sharp because I've been to a lot of places. That is why… Really-”</p> 
 <p>She could not continue to speak.</p> 
 <p>This was what she wanted to ask.</p> 
 <p>‘Really, is young master Cale-nim really okay? Your expression seems kind of fake, your highness.’</p> 
 <p>But she could not ask her question.</p> 
 <p>It was because Alberu started to speak as she stood there unable to finish her question.</p> 
 <p>“They’re fine. Those punks are fine.”</p> 
 <p>Cage closed her mouth after hearing his response. She then bowed and left the tent.</p> 
 <p>“I will quickly bring Miss Rosalyn over.”</p> 
 <p>Alberu was now left alone in the tent once Cage left.</p> 
 <p>“Huuuuuu.”</p> 
 <p>Alberu brushed his face with both hands.</p> 
 <p>He could feel that his hair was still wet with sweat.</p> 
 <p>The disgusting feel of it made Alberu start to frown as he recalled what Cale said again.</p> 
 <p>‘Then it is probably best not to tell them everything and just give them a brief positive explanation. Keep things positive, you know? It’s a simple request, right?’</p> 
 <p>‘Keep things positive, you know?’</p> 
 <p>Those words kept echoing in his mind.</p> 
 <p>“That damn bastard. He's pushing all the difficult things to me.”</p> 
 <p>Alberu could not stop frowning.</p> 
 <p>Keep things positive?</p> 
 <p>“How can I make any of that positive?”</p> 
 <p>Alberu recalled the night on the battlefield.</p> 
 <p>Fires, explosions…</p> 
 <p>The night was full of madness.</p> 
 <p>Alberu could not stop frowning while thinking about the two punks who were at the center of it all.</p> 
 <hr> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae raised his voice.</p> 
 <p>“Hey, Kim Rok Soo!”<br> "What?”</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae started to frown at Cale’s short response.</p> 
 <p>"Ah, this bastard is just going to speak informally to me now all the time, isn’t he?”</p> 
 <p>He then raised his voice again and shouted loud enough for Kim Rok Soo to hear.</p> 
 <p>“Hey! Y, your hyung-nim is acting weird!”</p> 
 <p>Cale created an opening and looked behind him.</p> 
 <p>The Dark Tiger had a somewhat blank expression on its face. The Dark Tiger made eye contact with Cale at that moment and Cale shouted toward it.</p> 
 <p>“Take down all the monsters in your way!”</p> 
 <p>There was a flash in the Dark Tiger's eyes and it quietly started to move its large body.</p> 
 <p>“Park Jin Tae! You fight too!”<br> “Man, people are going to think I am taking a break or something. Do you know how hard-!”</p> 
 <p>But Cale had already turned his head back and resumed fighting.</p> 
 <p>“Fuck!”</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae frowned before touching the gun in his hand.</p> 
 <p>His fingers were slightly shaking.</p> 
 <p>His body was full of minor injuries and he was bleeding.</p> 
 <p>“So annoying. It’s so annoying!”</p> 
 <p>It was still dark.</p> 
 <p>The sun was not coming up.</p> 
 <p>Everywhere around him was full of the stench of blood.</p> 
 <p>No.</p> 
 <p>It was full of the monsters’ disgusting body fluids.</p> 
 <p>Baaaaang!</p> 
 <p>He turned his gaze.</p> 
 <p>"What are you doing?”</p> 
 <p>Kim Min Ah moved past him.</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae looked to the side.</p> 
 <p>Kim Min Ah had pierced a monster that had tried to ambush Park Jin Tae from the side.</p> 
 <p>It was a Grade 1 monster.</p> 
 <p>It was a snake-headed giant, the same monster that Cale taught Kim Min Ah to fight against earlier.</p> 
 <p>“…So damn strong.”<br> “I've always been strong.”</p> 
 <p>Kim Min Ah said something else as she moved past Park Jin Tae.</p> 
 <p>“It’s just that I only recently learned how to fight properly. Isn't that the same for you?”</p> 
 <p>That was the case.</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae realized it as he learned how to fight properly as well.</p> 
 <p>Even though he was surrounded by chaos, blood, and madness…</p> 
 <p>He could feel it.</p> 
 <p>‘…Humans can win!’</p> 
 <p>He was getting faster and faster at dealing with the Grade 1 monsters by following Kim Rok Soo's data.</p> 
 <p>The people Kim Rok Soo had designated as the attack team were slowly starting to get a feel for their potential.</p> 
 <p>They were getting stronger, unlike these monsters.</p> 
 <p>It was worth trying.</p> 
 <p>They could win.</p> 
 <p>That was why they could not stop.</p> 
 <p>Even though this fucking night was so damn long…</p> 
 <p>Nobody could stop.</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae’s finger pulled the trigger.</p> 
 <p>Tang!</p> 
 <p>A bullet flew into a monster’s eye.</p> 
 <p>Ever since the cataclysm and the discovery of abilities… His shooting skills that had regressed for some reason were slowly returning again.</p> 
 <p>Baaaaaang-!</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae turned after hearing a loud noise.</p> 
 <p>“Roooooar!”<br> “Grr- grrrrr!”</p> 
 <p>Monsters were falling down as a shining black light shot up between them.</p> 
 <p>It was quite far away, but it was the only thing clearly visible in the darkness.</p> 
 <p>It could not be helped.</p> 
 <p>There was a person whose body was surrounded in rose gold current next to the shining black light.</p> 
 <p>Furthermore, the person dressed in white was visible thanks to that rose gold light as well, and Joo Ho-Shik, the person dressed in white, clenched his hands together.</p> 
 <p>“I have faith!”<br> “So fucking crazy!”</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae swore as he laughed after hearing the voice.</p> 
 <p>Those three people… No, those two people…</p> 
 <p>Choi Han and Kim Rok Soo…</p> 
 <p>He could see these two people fighting no matter where they were.</p> 
 <p>It was because of that rose gold current.</p> 
 <p>They were too visible in this battlefield full of Grade 2 and Grade 3 monsters and Grade 1 monsters as well.</p> 
 <p>That was why he could not stop.</p> 
 <p>That was also the reason that Cale could not stop.</p> 
 <p>He knew that people all around them were looking at him and Choi Han.</p> 
 <p>“Huff, huff. How much time has passed?”</p> 
 <p>He could hear Joo Ho-Shik's heavy breathing behind him.</p> 
 <p>Joo Ho-Shik who had been shouting, ‘I have faith!’ over and over was sticking to Choi Han and Cale to provide them significant support.</p> 
 <p>Cale had a watch.</p> 
 <p>“I’m not sure.”</p> 
 <p>But he did not have time to look at his watch.</p> 
 <p>“Roooooooooooooooar!”</p> 
 <p>Cale moved after looking at three Grade 1 monsters charging toward him.</p> 
 <p>2 meters to the left, and then backward in the 5 o’clock direction.</p> 
 <p>Then a thunderbolt to the front.</p> 
 <p>Crackle!</p> 
 <p>A small rose gold thunderbolt struck the monster’s body.</p> 
 <p>Slash, slash.</p> 
 <p>Choi Han's sword slashed two other Grade 1 monsters.</p> 
 <p>"Are you okay?”</p> 
 <p>Choi Han asked and Cale responded while laughing.</p> 
 <p>“Ask that after you catch your breath.”</p> 
 <p>Choi Han had been slowly breathing heavier since a bit earlier.</p> 
 <p>“Hyung, you’re in much worse condition.”</p> 
 <p>Choi Han stood in front of Cale and made it so that Cale could not keep moving forward.</p> 
 <p>Choi Han was correct.</p> 
 <p>Cale could tell that he was in terrible condition.</p> 
 <p>His hands were slightly shaking. There was dry blood by his mouth.</p> 
 <p>He was also turning pale.</p> 
 <p>‘But it's still bearable.’</p> 
 <p>He would not faint.</p> 
 <p>‘It’s all thanks to Joo Ho-Shik.’</p> 
 <p>Joo Ho-Shik's ‘faith’ was surprisingly able to amplify Cale’s ancient powers and Choi Han’s aura.</p> 
 <p>Actually, for some odd reason, Joo Ho-Shik's ability actually supported Cale and Choi Han better than the others.</p> 
 <p>‘Does Joo Ho-Shik have more faith in me and Choi Han?’</p> 
 <p>Joo Ho-Shik's ability changed strength based on the level of faith.</p> 
 <p>‘Why?’</p> 
 <p>Why would he feel that way?</p> 
 <p>Cale had many questions, but he chose to listen to what was going on rather than thinking about that again.</p> 
 <p>He could hear it.</p> 
 <p>He could hear the monsters’ cries.</p> 
 <p>But there was definitely less than before.</p> 
 <p>The fire and explosions destroyed most of the Grade 2 and Grade 3 monsters and the Grade 2 and Grade 3 monsters that had suddenly been ambushed while they were resting were unable to move quickly because of their large bodies and had their weaknesses attacked by the humans.</p> 
 <p>This ambush was a success.</p> 
 <p>However, there were still too many of them.</p> 
 <p>Monsters kept appearing no matter how many times they slashed and killed.</p> 
 <p>It was especially difficult because of the Grade 2 and Grade 3 monsters that became 1.5 times stronger from madness.</p> 
 <p>They were so crazy that they continued to charge forward even after receiving injuries that would normally make them become afraid, fall, or run away.</p> 
 <p>That stopping would make things a bit easier.</p> 
 <p>“Haaaaa.”</p> 
 <p>Cale sighed as he started to think.</p> 
 <p>‘When. When will the sun rise? If the sun came up…’</p> 
 <p>Then humans would become the predators instead of the prey.</p> 
 <p>Cale started to think about Joo Ho-Shik who had asked him the time and Park Jin Tae who had seemed a bit out of it.</p> 
 <p>He could then feel that the people were starting to slow down.</p> 
 <p>Even if the people he had gathered for this attack had grown at rapid speed and showed their talents…</p> 
 <p>Those people were starting to get tired.</p> 
 <p>They were almost out of strength.</p> 
 <p>They couldn't help it.</p> 
 <p>They were not used to such a long battle.</p> 
 <p>That was why he could not get tired yet.</p> 
 <p>“Choi Han.”<br> “Yes, hyung-nim?”<br> “The black Yong. Can you use it one more time?”</p> 
 <p>Unlike Choi Han's shining black aura, the black Yong required Choi Han to use a lot of strength. That was why he was fighting with his aura right now.</p> 
 <p>But Cale could read the mood of the battlefield.</p> 
 <p>As the others are getting tired…</p> 
 <p>“Yes, I can.”<br> “Then please use it.”</p> 
 <p>They needed to show those people the strength of their allies.</p> 
 <p>“Huuuuuu.”</p> 
 <p>Choi Han took a deep breath before pointing his sword toward the sky.</p> 
 <p>Black aura started to gather around his sword and slowly started to take the form of a black Yong.</p> 
 <p>“Mr. Joo Ho-Shik. Please use your ability on me.”</p> 
 <p>Choi Han flinched after hearing Cale’s statement, but he stayed still as he could not break his concentration.</p> 
 <p>Cale gathered fiery thunderbolts into both of his hands as Joo Ho-Shik shouted.</p> 
 <p>Cale could feel his fiery thunderbolts becoming stronger thanks to Joo Ho-Shik's ability.</p> 
 <p>He would use his fiery thunderbolts along with Choi Han’s black Yong to sweep through the battlefield.</p> 
 <p>Then the Grade 1 monsters should retreat back and the allies would feel revitalized.</p> 
 <p>Cale had such thoughts as he started to look toward the tip of Choi Han's sword that was pointed to the air.</p> 
 <p>That would be where the black Yong would soon open its jaw and charge through the battlefield.</p> 
 <p>But the moment he raised his head…</p> 
 <p>“…Ah.”</p> 
 <p>Cale's jaw dropped.</p> 
 <p>He reached out and grabbed Choi Han’s shoulder.</p> 
 <p>…Hyung?”</p> 
 <p>Cale nonchalantly commented as Choi Han flinched in response.</p> 
 <p>“The sun is coming up.”</p> 
 <p>The night sky was slowly starting to get brighter.</p> 
 <p>Night had passed and dawn was approaching.</p> 
 <p>"We did it.”</p> 
 <p>Cale added on.</p> 
 <p>“We passed the crucial moment.”</p> 
 <p>Cale looked around at the evidence of the fierce battle.</p> 
 <p>He could see the madness disappearing from the Grade 2 and Grade 3 monsters as the world became brighter.</p> 
 <p>The weakened Grade 2 and Grade 3 monsters slowly started to retreat.</p> 
 <p>Cale had a record in his memories.</p> 
 <p>&lt; Once the night passed, the Grade 2 and Grade 3 would no longer be crazy and would stop attacking the central shelters. &gt;<br> &lt; They could no longer attack, as it was now the Grade 1 monsters' turn to attack. &gt;<br> &lt; This was a rule that was followed at all original central shelters that were attacked. &gt;</p> 
 <p>Cale's gaze reached the Grade 1 monsters.</p> 
 <p>There were still many Grade 1 monsters that were alive.</p> 
 <p>But the crazy Grade 2 and Grade 3 monsters, humans, and leader monsters… Along with the fire and explosions… The chaos created by all sorts of things managed to kill many Grade 1 monsters.</p> 
 <p>And…</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae, Kim Min Ah, Bae Puh Rum, Bae Cheol-Ho, Che Soo Jung, etc.</p> 
 <p>He could see all of them.</p> 
 <p>They all looked tired.</p> 
 <p>They looked up at the sky that was lighting up before looking toward Cale.</p> 
 <p>Cale smiled toward them.</p> 
 <p>It was a smile that let them know that they had won, that they had survived.</p> 
 <p>He then said the following.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s finish the rest and head toward our new base.”</p> 
 <p>Everybody laughed and tightly clenched their weapons with shaking hands.</p>
