 <p><a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aHIlQFUVY5Y/maxresdefault.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Teaser</a></p>
 <p>‘Fire.<br>He has become fire.’</p>
 <p>That was the thought in Choi Han’s mind. The young Dragon's voice reached his ears as he blankly watched the burning fire.</p>
 <p>“Choi Han! Snap out of it! It's not over yet!”</p>
 <p>‘That fire is not the end?’</p>
 <p>Choi Han who was surrounded by multiple layers of silver shields flinched and started to shake. He then lowered his head.</p>
 <p>Screee- boom!<br>Boom- boom!</p>
 <p>The approximately thirty golems.<br>They were slowly melting down one by one.</p>
 <p>He could see something that wasn't melting within the fire as well.<br>The black liquid.<br>The thing that had dyed Choi Han’s sword black had not disappeared yet.</p>
 <p>‘Is Cale-nim’s fire useless as well?!’</p>
 <p>Choi Han’s eyes clouded over.</p>
 <p>‘Is it impossible to destroy that chunk of despair in the end?’</p>
 <p>It was the moment Choi Han asked that question to himself with concern.<br>Someone from outside the sea of fire started to speak.</p>
 <p>“It's bad if the fire goes out.”</p>
 <p>It was Imperial Prince Adin.</p>
 <p>‘The black despair will appear if the fire goes out. The Empire’s forces will feel even more chaos and become suspicious.’</p>
 <p>It would also make this area around Maple Castle desolate, forever turning it into a land of death that the living would have to avoid forever.<br>However, he could not help but want to smile.<br>He rubbed the back of his neck.</p>
 <p>“…Cale Henituse.”</p>
 <p>Shield. Earth. Water. Fire.<br>The same number of ancient powers as the White Star.</p>
 <p>He couldn’t tell whether the power Cale used to quickly approach him was an ancient power or a spell, however, he knew Cale had at least a minimum of four ancient powers.</p>
 <p>Cale Henituse managed to remain healthy while having four ancient powers.</p>
 <p>‘How entertaining.’</p>
 <p>It really was entertaining.<br>He also wanted to kill Cale.</p>
 <p>He figured something else out as well.</p>
 <p>“It was you.”</p>
 <p>It was Cale.<br>The unknown power that had foiled all of the Empire's plans until now had to be Cale.<br>Cale Henituse and the Roan Kingdom.</p>
 <p>They pretended to be on good terms with the Empire while aiming for their necks.<br>The pieces of the puzzle finally fell into place.</p>
 <p>He started to speak.</p>
 <p>“Immediately launch magic spells toward Cale Henituse!”</p>
 <p>He didn't care about the destroyed golems, the dying pilots, nor the screeching despair.<br>All he was thinking about was the damage control he needed to do once the black despair was revealed.</p>
 <p>‘Even Cale Henituse will not be able to get rid of the black despair.’</p>
 <p>The black despair was still wailing from inside this sea of fire.</p>
 <p>Screeeech- screeeeeeech-</p>
 <p>The dead were still crying.<br>Even formidable powers could not destroy the black despair.</p>
 <p>‘Then I will kill Cale Henituse and blame it on him.’</p>
 <p>There was a way to solve everything as long as he killed Cale.</p>
 <p>“Vice Tower Master! Mage Brigade Captain!”</p>
 <p>Two people quickly became alert as Adin called for them. However, the other nobles and soldiers were all still out of it.<br>Adin emphasized his order.</p>
 <p>“Aim for Cale Henituse! He is currently standing still!”</p>
 <p>Cale Henituse was currently floating in place without moving.</p>
 <p>“Can’t you hear the screams of the dying golem pilots?! We must quickly get revenge for them and the Empire!”<br>“Follow his highness's orders! Everybody use the magic stones and launch your strongest attacks!”</p>
 <p>Metelona quickly ordered the mages and alchemists.</p>
 <p>“Our target is Cale Henituse!”</p>
 <p>There was only one target.<br>It was the person who had created this amazing situation.</p>
 <p>Oooooooong- Ooooooooong-</p>
 <p>The mages started to cast spells with shaking hands.</p>
 <p>“Only death awaits us if that fire reaches us!”</p>
 <p>This comment from the Imperial Prince made everyone start to move.<br>They quickly prepared to launch their spells and were waiting for the command to launch their attacks. Metelona peeked toward the Imperial Prince who raised his hand up.</p>
 <p>Adin’s hand coming down would be the signal to launch their attacks.<br>His hand slowly went down.</p>
 <p>He then smiled as he looked toward the battlefield.<br>Why?</p>
 <p>‘Honte is smiling.’</p>
 <p>Honte, the Tower Master’s disciple, was smiling. He seemed to be enjoying it.<br>That was why he was certain.</p>
 <p>The Empire was currently not in danger.<br>Cale Henituse would die.</p>
 <p>That was the reason Adin could smile while looking at the fire.</p>
 <p>However, something happened at that moment.<br>Adin heard someone's voice as he lowered his hand. It was someone who had not said anything until now. Honte.<br>Honte started to speak.</p>
 <p>“…I need to inform the White Star.”</p>
 <p>Honte continued to speak.</p>
 <p>“This is that power. The power of the forgotten ones. The true ancient powers.”</p>
 <p>The Imperial Prince's eyes opened wide at that moment.<br>Things were changing.<br>The sea of fire was changing.<br>He heard Honte's voice again.</p>
 <p>“…We must kill him. We must kill him before they are all gathered together.”</p>
 <p>He heard another voice at that moment.<br>One of the mages who were preparing to attack sat down and shouted out.</p>
 <p>“I can’t do it sir! I, I can’t do it!! I can’t, a, attack while l, looking at that!”</p>
 <p>The mage looked at the sight in front of him and grabbed his shaking hands. His eyes were focused on Cale.</p>
 <p>Things were gathering toward Cale.<br>The black smoke, no, the black smoke skulls headed toward Cale.</p>
 <p>Screeeeeech- screeeeeeech-</p>
 <p>They shrieked as they moved toward Cale.</p>
 <p>Cale didn't care about that as he stood there with his head down.<br>He had this thought every so often.</p>
 <p>‘How would it feel to cause a shit show and flip everything over as a munchkin?’ <span id="footnote-ref-5bf2"><a href="#footnote-5bf2">[1]</a></span></p>
 <p>Would it be refreshing?<br>Entertaining?<br>Fun?</p>
 <p>‘Fun my ass!’</p>
 <p>It felt like shit.<br>He looked down at the ground.</p>
 <p>He could see the melting golems.<br>He could also see the alchemist pilots who were burning to death or just blankly sitting there.<br>Furthermore, he could see the disgusting and sticky black despair.<br>The ground became dyed black as that despair touched the ground. The black smoke and the shrieks became even worse.</p>
 <p>Cale lifted his head up.<br>He could see Choi Han standing there in shock as the black smoke surrounded him. Cale let out a chuckle.</p>
 <p>He then got started.</p>
 <p>He decided to properly use this power that he could not control.</p>
 <p>Screeeeeech- screeeeeeech-</p>
 <p>Cale, who was covered in black from the black smoke and surrounded by shrieks, slowly landed on the ground.<br>He stepped in the middle of the golem pilots, the black despair, and the ground that was filled with fire.</p>
 <p>“Cale-nim!”</p>
 <p>Choi Han tried to run out of the silver shield in shock.</p>
 <p>“That liquid…!”</p>
 <p>The black despair. That sticky liquid gathered toward Cale. They gathered together next to Cale, who could not be seen because of the black smoke and shrieks.</p>
 <p>Cale slowly disappeared into that black swamp.<br>He looked as if he would drown in it soon enough.</p>
 <p>“No!”</p>
 <p>‘He can’t become bewitched like me! He can’t be tricked by that power!’</p>
 <p>Choi Han tried to run out of the shield. However, there was an invisible presence preventing him from doing so.</p>
 <p>“Raon, don't stop me!”<br>“Stupid Choi Han! Did you forget what the human said?!”</p>
 <p>Choi Han who had been shouting flinched.<br>The young Dragon repeated what Cale had said to Choi Han.</p>
 <p>“The human said that he might not be able to control the power! But the human is still okay! There’s no issue with his plate either!”</p>
 <p>Raon was calmly assessing Cale's status right now.</p>
 <p>“The human is just starting!”</p>
 <p>The black Dragon could see it.</p>
 <p>He could feel warmth coming from Cale, the person he called, ‘our human.’<br>Warmth was one of the reasons people sought out fire.<br>It was something that consoled the cold and the lonely.</p>
 <p>The cold and lonely things were currently gathering around that power.<br>The black smoke and the shrieks.<br>The despairs of the dead people were gathering around Cale's warmth.</p>
 <p>Raon shouted once they had all gathered together.</p>
 <p>“They’re going to disappear! They will disappear!”</p>
 <p>‘What?’</p>
 <p>Choi Han’s vision turned red as he questioned Raon's comment.</p>
 <p>Paaaat-</p>
 <p>A red light shot out.<br>This rose gold colored light blasted out from the center of the sea of fire.</p>
 <p>“…The black things-”</p>
 <p>The black things, the skulls, and the sticky black liquid were all burning.<br>The black swamp was burning.</p>
 <p>This sight didn't give off as much pressure as the initial sea of fire.<br>However, nobody was able to say anything right now.</p>
 <p>Screeeeeech- screeeeeeech-</p>
 <p>The terrible shrieks. The grotesque cries of unknown origin. They disappeared.</p>
 <p>The black smoke turned white while the black liquid was slowly eaten up by the rose gold light.<br>They could hear something else as that happened.</p>
 <p>“Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!<br>Aaaaaaah-<br>Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!”</p>
 <p>They could hear people.<br>They could hear lots of different voices of people crying. Those voices slowly floated up into the air with the now white smoke.</p>
 <p>The sea of fire started to die down as well.<br>The fire was going out on its own.<br>The golems disappeared without a trace.<br>Everything had disappeared without a trace.</p>
 <p>The screeches and explosions were all gone. Rosalyn, who was on Maple Castle, raised her head.</p>
 <p>Drip, drip.<br>She could see rose gold dust on the silver shield.</p>
 <p>No, they were ashes.</p>
 <p>Fire only left smoke and ashes once it burned up.<br>She opened her mouth to speak.</p>
 <p>“…Purification.”</p>
 <p>It was a beautiful sight, as if dust was falling from the sun.</p>
 <p>Plop. Plop.<br>The rose gold ashes fell on the burnt black ground like snow.</p>
 <p>They also landed on someone's shoulders.<br>The rose gold ashes gently landed on Cale Henituse’s hair and shoulders.</p>
 <p>Cale lifted his head up.<br>One of his knees buckled.</p>
 <p>“Cale-nim!”</p>
 <p>Choi Han caught Cale as he was falling forward. Choi Han’s eyes were opened wide.</p>
 <p>Drip.<br>A strand of black blood was running down the corner of Cale’s mouth.<br>Choi Han was frowning although the falling rose gold ashes looked beautiful.</p>
 <p>This beautiful and peaceful situation that did not have any loud explosions nor noises required a lot of strength.<br>This silence required a sacrifice in order to attain it.<br>Choi Han knew that this was the case.</p>
 <p>“C, Cale-nim-”</p>
 <p>Choi Han’s hands were shaking. He tried his best to support Cale in standing up straight.<br>It was at that moment.<br>Cale's mouth started to move.</p>
 <p>Choi Han felt an invisible round front paw pushing his hand away at the same time.</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Choi Han, move!</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Choi Han’s eyes opened wide once more after seeing something appear in front of his eyes.</p>
 <p>It was a piece of soggy apple pie.<br>It floated in the air before landing inside Cale’s mouth. Choi Han heard a sniffling voice in his mind.</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Human! Our human! You’re hungry! I know you're hungry! That’s your, ‘I'm hungry,’ look! I'm relieved! The human feels like he has starved for three days, but he will not die!<br>“R, Raon?”</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Choi Han was shocked, but soon saw Cale happily eating the apple pie.<br>Cale’s face was filled with fatigue from hard work. Cale chewed on the apple pie while his body was slumped over without any strength before shouting out loud.</p>
 <p>“Aim for the monsters on land!”</p>
 <p>Choi Han flinched.<br>He had heard this at the beginning of the battle.<br>Clopeh had said the same thing as he got on the white skeleton bird.</p>
 <p>‘Fly up!’</p>
 <p>And then…</p>
 <p>‘Aim for the monsters on land!’</p>
 <p>People believed that Clopeh was talking about the golems when he said, ‘monsters.’<br>Choi Han started to smile.</p>
 <p>He was finally relieved.<br>Cale was okay right now.</p>
 <p>Piiiiiiiiiiiiii- Piiiiiiiiiiiiii-</p>
 <p>He heard the sound of a flute.<br>The white skeleton birds that had escaped high up in the sky had returned.<br>They all headed toward a single direction like an arrow.<br>Clopeh started to shout.</p>
 <p>“The Commander has given us an order! Keke, kahahahaha! It is finally time to capture the monster on land!”</p>
 <p>The beaks of the white skeleton birds and the swords of the knights were all pointed toward the same spot.</p>
 <p>The monster on land.</p>
 <p>Imperial Prince Adin.</p>
 <p>The truth behind the order Cale had given to Clopeh was aimed at the Empire like an arrow.<br>Cale then smiled brightly before speaking to Choi Han, who was looking at him.</p>
 <p>“Choi Han.”<br>“Yes Cale-nim.”</p>
 <p>Cale's head was spinning right now.<br>He had used too much power.</p>
 <p>“Slap me.”</p>
 <p>Silence filled the area for a moment before it finally broke.</p>
 <p>“…Excuse me? A, are you okay? You seem confused?”</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Human, are you okay? Your plate is fine! Do you go crazy when you use your power now?</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Cale calmly answered back when Choi Han and Raon were truly concerned.</p>
 <p>“I feel like I’m going to faint.”</p>
 <p>It would be bad if he fainted right now.</p>
