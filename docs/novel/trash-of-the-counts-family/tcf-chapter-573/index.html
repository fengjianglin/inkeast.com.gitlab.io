 <p>At the central shelter closest to the one Cale was at…</p> 
 <p>“Fuck!”</p> 
 <p>Jae Ha-Jung who was taking on the role of supporter at this location was frowning with both of his hands shaking.</p> 
 <p>The tree trunks coming out of his hands were tightly binding a large iron door.</p> 
 <p>Baaaaang! Bang!</p> 
 <p>But the iron door looked ready to break at any moment from the banging.</p> 
 <p>No, it was already starting to break.</p> 
 <p>The door had dents here and there and it was starting to bend, slowly causing gaps to appear on the sides.</p> 
 <p>And beyond the iron door…</p> 
 <p>“Kihehehe!”</p> 
 <p>They heard the laughter of an animal that resembled a monkey.</p> 
 <p>The banging on the iron door became louder every time it laughed.</p> 
 <p>“Fuck!”</p> 
 <p>He started to frown.</p> 
 <p>‘It’s toying with us!’</p> 
 <p>The monster was toying with the people who were hiding inside and doing everything they could to resist.</p> 
 <p>But that was slowly coming to an end.</p> 
 <p>“Hyung-nim!”</p> 
 <p>Bae Cheol-Ho, the ‘General’ at this central shelter, clenched his hand that was holding a piece of paper after hearing Jae Ha-Jung's desperate voice.</p> 
 <p>It was the information that Park Jin Tae, the leader of the nearby central shelter, had brought him last night.</p> 
 <p>He had thought that the fearless Park Jin Tae had finally gone crazy after hearing that it was information from one of his shelter’s ability users with the power of foresight.</p> 
 <p>But everything on that paper was true.</p> 
 <p>The monsters appeared along with the solar eclipse. The weaker Grade 3 monsters came charging in first.</p> 
 <p>Then, seven taster monsters appeared.</p> 
 <p>This extremely accurate foresight gave him the chills, but this information allowed them to last until now.</p> 
 <p>…Yes, until now.</p> 
 <p>It didn’t look as if they could last any longer.</p> 
 <p>“Ugh.”<br> “Huff, huff!”</p> 
 <p>There were injured people groaning in pain behind Bae Cheol-Ho.</p> 
 <p>And in front of him…</p> 
 <p>Beyond the breaking iron door…</p> 
 <p>“Kihehehe!”</p> 
 <p>He could hear the red monkey monster’s laugh as the other monsters started to approach.</p> 
 <p>He could see the Grade 2 monsters getting closer through the only crack on the boarded windows that they had purposely left in order to be able to look out.</p> 
 <p>The other Grade 1 taster monsters that had been leisurely enjoying the situation from the rear were approaching as well.</p> 
 <p>This all started to happen once the Steel Feather Hawk disappeared.</p> 
 <p>“Hyung-nim!”<br> "General-nim!”</p> 
 <p>Bae Cheol-Ho could hear people shouting for him from multiple directions.</p> 
 <p>The veins on the hand clenching the paper looked ready to burst, but he was just looking at the iron door that was on the brink of breaking with a stoic expression.</p> 
 <p>But he could not do that any longer.</p> 
 <p>“Hyung-nim! I can't hold on any longer!”</p> 
 <p>Jae Ha-Jung shouted toward Bae Cheol-Ho while looking as if he was going to cry.</p> 
 <p>His shaking hands and sweat-drenched body were telling them that he had reached his limits.</p> 
 <p>Bae Cheol-Ho grabbed his weapon again.</p> 
 <p>If it was difficult to last inside the building, he needed to at least head outside and lure the monsters away.</p> 
 <p>Bae Cheol-Ho started to speak.</p> 
 <p>“…Jae Ha-Jung.”</p> 
 <p>Jae Ha-Jung started to frown as if he knew what was about to happen.</p> 
 <p>Bae Cheol-Ho and Jae Ha-Jung started to speak at the same time.</p> 
 <p>“You can sto-”<br> “Hyung-nim, I will do what I can to hold on a little loon-”</p> 
 <p>It was at that moment.</p> 
 <p>{Starting now.}</p> 
 <p>Everybody inside the building shut up.</p> 
 <p>It was that voice.</p> 
 <p>They could not forget the voice that they heard during the solar eclipse. It was the voice that had been providing them with information every hour.</p> 
 <p>{We will now send the first round of reinforcements.}</p> 
 <p>Jae Ha-Jung and Bae Cheol-Ho looked toward each other.</p> 
 <p>Bae Cheol-Ho clenched his fists again.</p> 
 <p>{Please hold on a little longer.}</p> 
 <p>The woman continued to speak.</p> 
 <p>{The first round of reinforcements will take care of all taster monsters.}</p> 
 <p>Bae Cheol-Ho released his clenched fists.</p> 
 <p>Jae Ha-Jung started to mumble.</p> 
 <p>“…What? Is that even possible?”</p> 
 <p>‘Taking care of all taster monsters? How was that possible?’</p> 
 <p>Everybody had those thoughts.</p> 
 <p>Bae Cheol-Ho’s voice echoed inside the building at that moment.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s hold on a little longer!”</p> 
 <p>Someone with an arm injury started to shout toward Bae Cheol-Ho.</p> 
 <p>“General! There’s no way that is true-!”<br> “No matter what, it means that someone is coming to help us!”</p> 
 <p>The person speaking to Bae Cheol-Ho shut his mouth.</p> 
 <p>Bae Cheol-Ho looked around.</p> 
 <p>‘We already gave up on running away.’</p> 
 <p>Some people had tried to give up on the central shelter and run away when the Grade 3 monsters came to attack, but most of them had stayed in the building.</p> 
 <p>It was because they knew it was hell outside as well.</p> 
 <p>Bae Cheol-Ho had also convinced them with the information in his hand.</p> 
 <p>‘We can only keep holding on here even if we end up dying.’</p> 
 <p>They needed to last just one night.</p> 
 <p>Bae Cheol-Ho made up his mind.</p> 
 <p>He then walked over to Jae Ha-Jung.</p> 
 <p>“Jae Ha-Jung! Please keep it up for a little longer!”</p> 
 <p>Bae Cheol-Ho then moved his hands toward the iron door that was barely being maintained by the tree trunks rather than to his weapon.</p> 
 <p>Jae Ha-Jung started to frown while watching him.</p> 
 <p>“…Fuck! I have no choice but to keep it up!”</p> 
 <p>He put more strength into his shaking hands with an annoyed expression.</p> 
 <p>“Sigh.”<br> “Hey, let's go.”</p> 
 <p>Other people were shaking their heads but still walked over to the iron door and pushed against it with their hands.</p> 
 <p>These were the people who were not severely injured.</p> 
 <p>The other people started to quickly move as well.</p> 
 <p>“Hey! Go bring that couch and put it by the door!”<br> “Ask the people on the second floor! See if they have anything else to throw outside! What is up with the kid making the flaming bottles?”<br> “She’s out right now from lack of strength!”<br> “Haah, shit! Throw whatever we can! We need to prevent as many monsters from getting near here!”</p> 
 <p>But those noises stopped for a moment.</p> 
 <p>“Kihehe! Hehe! Kihehehe!”</p> 
 <p>It was because the monster’s laughing started to become louder.</p> 
 <p>But they quickly snapped out of it.</p> 
 <p>It was because of the voice echoing in their minds.</p> 
 <p>‘We will now send the first round of reinforcements.’</p> 
 <p>It should get at least a little better than now if they could hold on for just a bit longer.</p> 
 <p>That thought was starting to take hold in people's minds.</p> 
 <p>But they didn’t have much time.</p> 
 <p>As they started to think about how much time must have passed since they heard the voice…</p> 
 <p>Baaaaang! Bang! Baaaaang!</p> 
 <p>Jae Ha-Jung could feel his legs slowly starting to lose strength.</p> 
 <p>“Ugh!”</p> 
 <p>He didn’t even have the strength to grumble anymore.</p> 
 <p>All he could do was groan.</p> 
 <p>Someone who watched him struggle asked Bae Cheol-Ho a question.</p> 
 <p>“When do you think they’ll get here? Hopefully they get here quickly!”</p> 
 <p>Bae Cheol-Ho could not respond to that question. It could not be helped.</p> 
 <p>‘…It’ll take them a while.’</p> 
 <p>He was thinking about the distance between Park Jin Tae's central shelter and this central shelter.</p> 
 <p>They were pretty close in comparison to most central shelters, but it was still quite the distance.</p> 
 <p>‘It's not just the distance we have to worry about right now.’</p> 
 <p>They had to get past the monster obstacles to get here.</p> 
 <p>They said to hold on a little longer, but Bae Cheol-Ho was certain that it would be a long time.</p> 
 <p>‘And if the sun goes down during that time-’</p> 
 <p>Forget it passing 5 pm as they fought against the monsters to get here, if the sun went down…</p> 
 <p>‘…They might not come.’</p> 
 <p>Bae Cheol-Ho was thinking about the worst possible scenario.</p> 
 <p>It was his job to do that.</p> 
 <p>This was the only thing he could say to the others.</p> 
 <p>“…They will get here if we keep holding on.”</p> 
 <p>His job was to give them at least a small amount of hope.</p> 
 <p>But his mind was full of concern about how to get past this difficult situation, as he could not just irresponsibly give them false hope.</p> 
 <p>‘At least the information Park Jin Tae gave us is reliable.’</p> 
 <p>That information had not lied.</p> 
 <p>That was why it was the thing he could trust the most right now.</p> 
 <p>“Hyu, hyung-nim!”</p> 
 <p>Bae Cheol-Ho then heard the person who was looking out the crack in the window on his behalf shouting in shock.</p> 
 <p>‘Are they already here?!’</p> 
 <p>Bae Cheol-Ho urgently looked toward the person thinking that the reinforcements had arrived.</p> 
 <p>"General-nim!”</p> 
 <p>A scout who was on a higher floor ran down the stairs in shock as he called out to Bae Cheol-Ho.</p> 
 <p>Bae Cheol-Ho then saw the person who had called him from the window.</p> 
 <p>“Ah.”</p> 
 <p>Bae Cheol-Ho let out a gasp.</p> 
 <p>What he saw on the person's face was despair and not joy.</p> 
 <p>They all then heard the scout who was coming down the stairs.</p> 
 <p>“T, there’s another monster that appeared in the sky! It seems to be a Grade 1 monster based on its size!”</p> 
 <p>All of their faces filled with despair.</p> 
 <p>They had been toyed with by the Steel Feather Hawk that was 1.5 times stronger than the other Grade 1 monsters until now.</p> 
 <p>‘There’s nobody worth chatting with here.’</p> 
 <p>The Steel Feather Hawk that had toyed with them left after saying that.</p> 
 <p>The remaining Grade 1 monsters started to run wild after that and the Grade 2 monsters started charging forward.</p> 
 <p>But another flying monster in such a situation?!</p> 
 <p>They couldn’t help but become filled with despair.</p> 
 <p>Bae Cheol-Ho started to speak at that moment.</p> 
 <p>“…That's not possible.”</p> 
 <p>The information said that only seven Grade 1 monsters would appear right now.</p> 
 <p>But there was another one?</p> 
 <p>Was this information wrong?</p> 
 <p>Bae Cheol-Ho’s mind started to go blank.</p> 
 <p>The person looking out the window continued to speak at that moment.</p> 
 <p>"T, the monster is heading down! I, it seems to be heading toward us!”</p> 
 <p>His voice was shaking.</p> 
 <p>It was full of fear. That fear quickly spread to everybody inside the central shelter.</p> 
 <p>Bae Cheol-Ho started to frown after realizing this.</p> 
 <p>“Damn it!”</p> 
 <p>Bae Cheol-Ho moved his hands away from supporting the door and urgently ran toward the crack in the window.</p> 
 <p>“Hyung-nim, over there-”</p> 
 <p>The person at the window pointed in a direction for him.</p> 
 <p>“…Ho.”</p> 
 <p>Bae Cheol-Ho let out a gasp.</p> 
 <p>His gasp put even more fear on the faces of the others inside the building.</p> 
 <p>The person next to Bae Cheol-Ho continued to shout.</p> 
 <p>“I, it is descending extremely quickly!”</p> 
 <p>The extremely large monster was descending extremely quickly as he mentioned. It looked as if it wanted to destroy this building.</p> 
 <p>The person whispered quietly so that only Bae Cheol-Ho could hear.</p> 
 <p>“Hyung-nim, should we run away? We can’t last-”</p> 
 <p>Bae Cheol-Ho looked up at the sky before barely managing to open his mouth.</p> 
 <p>“Yes. We will start with the people in the rear.”<br> “Yes, sir. We will move the old and the weak firs-”<br> “Hold on!”</p> 
 <p>The person had to stop talking after hearing Bae Cheol-Ho shout.</p> 
 <p>He looked toward Bae Cheol-Ho in confusion.</p> 
 <p>“Hyung-nim?”<br> “…What is that?”</p> 
 <p>Bae Cheol-Ho moved his face closer to the window instead of looking at the other person.</p> 
 <p>His gaze was focused on the monster that was descending faster and faster.</p> 
 <p>He then said a single question.</p> 
 <p>“…A person?”</p> 
 <p>Silence filled the building again.</p> 
 <p>Bae Cheol-Ho started to mumble in disbelief through the silence.</p> 
 <p>“…There's a person on top of the monster’s back?”</p> 
 <p>What the hell was going on?</p> 
 <p>Even Jae Ha-Jung looked toward Bae Cheol-Ho in shock.</p> 
 <p>He then saw and heard something.</p> 
 <p>He saw that Bae Cheol-Ho's eyes that had been full of despair and disappointment slowly focus again while his voice no longer sounded weak.</p> 
 <p>Bae Cheol-Ho continued to speak.</p> 
 <p>“In addition to the monster…!”</p> 
 <p>He couldn't believe it.</p> 
 <p>But he could now see the people who had originally been covered by the monster’s large body.</p> 
 <p>There was one person on the monster's back.</p> 
 <p>Then there were some more people descending behind the monster.</p> 
 <p>His instinct was telling him something.</p> 
 <p>“It’s the reinforcements!”</p> 
 <p>People heard a loud groan as soon as he shouted.</p> 
 <p>Baaaaaang!</p> 
 <p>“Ugh!”</p> 
 <p>Jae Ha-Jung groaned and fell on his knees at that moment.</p> 
 <p>“Dodge!”<br> “Grab Ha-Jung and retreat!”</p> 
 <p>The people who were supporting the iron door grabbed Jae Ha-Jung and moved back.</p> 
 <p>The tree trunks started to break…</p> 
 <p>And a large hole appeared on the iron door that could not hold out any longer.</p> 
 <p>“Kihehe! Kihehehe!”</p> 
 <p>The red monkey monster outside the hole was laughing while looking at them.</p> 
 <p>Screeeech-</p> 
 <p>The iron door with the large hole slowly started to crumble.</p> 
 <p>Boom!</p> 
 <p>The iron door fell and there was nothing left to protect them.</p> 
 <p>“…Ah.”</p> 
 <p>Jae Ha-Jung’s eyes became blurry as he watched.</p> 
 <p>“Kihehe! Hehehe!”</p> 
 <p>The red monkey took a step into the building.</p> 
 <p>The monkey with red fur and red eyes looked excited. It seemed excited at the fact that it could now kill these people.</p> 
 <p>‘I worked my ass off to hold on!’</p> 
 <p>Jae Ha-Jung bit down on his lips and it started to bleed.</p> 
 <p>‘No. It couldn't continue like this. This couldn't be it.’</p> 
 <p>His shaking lips opened as he started to speak.</p> 
 <p>“N, no-”</p> 
 <p>It was at that moment.</p> 
 <p>“Kihehe?”</p> 
 <p>The monkey looked up at the sky.</p> 
 <p>Boooom!</p> 
 <p>The people inside could hear a loud noise as a shadow covered the iron door.</p> 
 <p>“Kihehe?”</p> 
 <p>The monkey slowly turned its head after seeing a shadow cover its body.</p> 
 <p>And then it saw it.</p> 
 <p>“Grrrrrrrrr!”<br> “Grrrrrrr!”<br> “Screeeeeeech!”</p> 
 <p>The Grade 2 monsters were quickly retreating.</p> 
 <p>They seemed to be in a hurry.</p> 
 <p>However, the red monkey could not see that properly.</p> 
 <p>It was the same for the people inside the central shelter.</p> 
 <p>“Kiiiiiiiiiii, kiiiiiiiiii-”</p> 
 <p>The red monkey subconsciously started to curl up.</p> 
 <p>The monkey's red eyes looked toward the arrogant black eyes looking down at it.</p> 
 <p>Bae Cheol-Ho started to speak.</p> 
 <p>“… A tiger.”</p> 
 <p>A black tiger with a lion's mane had landed on the ground and was now looking at the red monkey and the people inside the central shelter with a nonchalant expression.</p> 
 <p>It was at that moment.</p> 
 <p>“Mr. Bae Cheol-Ho?”</p> 
 <p>They could all see a person on the tiger's neck.</p> 
 <p>Bae Cheol-Ho looked toward that man as well.</p> 
 <p>A skinny young man started to speak.</p> 
 <p>“The reinforcements are here.”<br> “Ah.”</p> 
 <p>Bae Cheol-Ho let out a gasp.</p> 
 <p>He could see Cale who was standing there with a relaxed smile.</p> 
 <p>Cale patted the Dark Tiger's body with one hand.</p> 
 <p>“Hyung-nim.”</p> 
 <p>Alberu started to speak with a frown on his face.</p> 
 <p>“…There’s no way, right?”</p> 
 <p>It wasn’t what he was thinking, was it?</p> 
 <p>Alberu had a small amount of hope.</p> 
 <p>However, Cale easily ignored that hope.</p> 
 <p>“Hyung-nim.”<br> “…What is it?”</p> 
 <p>Unlike Alberu who responded weakly, Cale pointed toward the red monkey and shouted in a refreshing manner.</p> 
 <p>“Please bite it!”</p> 
 <p>Alberu lowered his head and mumbled to himself.</p> 
 <p>“…Damn it.”</p>
