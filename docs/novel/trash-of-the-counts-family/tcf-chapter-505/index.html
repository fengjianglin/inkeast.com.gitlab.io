 <p>“That is not allowed.”</p> 
 <p>Cale turned his head.<br> He could see Choi Han’s stiff expression. He looked toward Cale and started to sternly speak.</p> 
 <p>“I don’t know what thoughts you are having right now, but no matter what they are, they are not allowed.”<br> “Hmm?”<br> “Please let me tell you a fact.”</p> 
 <p>Clang.</p> 
 <p>Choi Han slightly pulled his sword out of the scabbard.</p> 
 <p>“You will die if you are stabbed in the heart. Blood is not allowed.”</p> 
 <p>Choi Han’s vicious glare made Cale’s already wildly beating heart beat even faster.</p> 
 <p>Forget being his senior or whatever, that gaze was really scary no matter what.<br> Extremely scary.<br> That was why he subconsciously responded like this.</p> 
 <p>“Are you crazy? I'm someone who dreams about living a long life as a wealthy slacker!”</p> 
 <p>‘Ah.’</p> 
 <p>He really ended up sharing his honest sentiments.</p> 
 <p>“……”</p> 
 <p>However, Choi Han just quietly observed him without saying anything.</p> 
 <p>‘…Why does it look like you are looking at me with pity?’</p> 
 <p>Cale looked away as he could not meet Choi Han’s gaze any longer. Pendrick started to speak at that moment.</p> 
 <p>“Anyway, I delivered the World Tree-nim's message.”</p> 
 <p>Cale looked at Pendrick and thought about the World Tree.</p> 
 <p>‘Does she know about the Vitality of the Heart that I have?’</p> 
 <p>He felt iffy after thinking that the World Tree might know about all of his ancient powers.</p> 
 <p>‘…I thought she said my future was not visible.’</p> 
 <p>Did she lie when she said that it was difficult to see the futures of people with ancient powers?</p> 
 <p>‘I don't think that it is that.’</p> 
 <p>Cale had a lot to think about.<br> The problem was that this was not the time to thoroughly think things through.</p> 
 <p>“Grooooooooa-”</p> 
 <p>There was a shaman on the ground twitching and groaning in pain.</p> 
 <p>Baaaaaang!<br> Boom. <br> Boobooboooooooooom-!</p> 
 <p>He also heard things breaking in all directions.</p> 
 <p>‘Aren't they all just destroying things without thinking about what to do after that?’</p> 
 <p>Everybody seemed to be using all their powers as if there was no tomorrow. He needed to stop that.<br> They needed to conserve some strength to escape from the palace and reunite with Bud’s side.</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>…Excuse me.</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>The fake World Tree cautiously started to speak at that moment. They could chat because there were branches still holding Cale up.<br> Cale looked toward the World Tree.</p> 
 <p>“Cale-nim.”</p> 
 <p>However, Choi Han called out to him, making him motion for Choi Han to hold on for a moment. However, he turned toward Choi Han after hearing what he said next.</p> 
 <p>“This fake tree is being controlled by Elisneh. It is resisting it right now, but it can only maintain that for about 20 more minutes.”<br> “…20 minutes?”<br> “Yes. That is why we planned to destroy the maze during that time, injure the enemies as much as possible, and leave with you, Cale-nim.”</p> 
 <p>Cale started to frown.<br> It was only 30 minutes if he added the time he had been unconscious. It was a short amount of time.</p> 
 <p>“Were you all attacking at full strength because you didn't have much time?”<br> “That is correct. I thought that escaping was the most important thing right now. I also thought that it would be difficult for Elisneh to cast an illusion properly if we were running wild like this.”</p> 
 <p>Choi Han was correct. </p> 
 <p>‘That is true, but…’</p> 
 <p>“Choi Han. You can’t use all of your strength without saving any for when an urgent situation might pop up later. Make sure nobody goes overboard.”<br> “…I understand.”</p> 
 <p>Choi Han was silent for a few seconds before responding.<br> However, Cale turned his gaze after feeling an odd sensation only to find Pendrick looking at him with an odd expression.</p> 
 <p>“What is it? Do you have something to say?”<br> “N, no.”</p> 
 <p>Pendrick was shaking his head but still looking at Cale with disbelief.<br> He could clearly see that Cale was pale and had dry blood on his lips from using his ancient powers. That was why he couldn't believe what Cale was saying.</p> 
 <p>‘…He truly cares more about his friends than his own body. No wonder he was able to overcome the illusion.’</p> 
 <p>Pendrick understood what Choi Han, who was standing there with a stiff expression, must be feeling. Anybody serving such a liege would feel frustrated but also respect that person.</p> 
 <p>Cale opened his mouth to speak.</p> 
 <p>“First, let the others know that I woke up-”<br> -H, h, humaaaaaaaaaaan-!</p> 
 <p>‘…Ha. Something always pops up when I try to do something.’</p> 
 <p>Cale started to frown as he thought about the invisible Dragon that was probably charging toward him right now.</p> 
 <p>Boom!</p> 
 <p>He then flinched.<br> Something had slammed into the tree.<br> He was certain it was Raon.</p> 
 <p>“…Raon. Are you okay?”</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Human! You woke up?</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>However, Raon didn't seem to hear Cale’s question.</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>I'm relieved! Human, I'm destroying the maze right now! I'll turn the maze walls into sand!</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>…The six-years-old Dragon's vocabulary was increasing, but it seemed to be moving in a dangerous direction.</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Weak human, you sit still. We will take care of everything! Hey black tree, don't let him out! The human will faint if you let him out!</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>Squeeze.</p> 
 <p>The black tree enveloped Cale a little tighter.<br> Cale could not help but sigh.</p> 
 <p>“Haaaaa.”</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Ah right! We got a call from the crown prince!<br> “…What?”</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>A video communication device suddenly appeared in the air and headed for Choi Han’s hand.<br> The red video communication device was immediately connected.</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Why did you take so long to answ-! …Dongsaeng. Are you captured somewhere?</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>Alberu who had answered the call with a look of urgency looked confused.</p> 
 <p>“It’s nothing much, sir. What is going on?”</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Tsk.</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>Alberu lightly clicked his tongue.<br> Cale’s appearance was terrible for it to be nothing much. It even made him debate if he needed to find some good medicine for Cale.<br> However, Alberu did not have time to think about such things right now.</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>We got information that some suspicious individuals have entered the northwest region.</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>Cale’s gaze instantly changed. His body automatically leaned closer to the video communication device.</p> 
 <p>The White Star needed to go to the Roan Kingdom's northwest region, the third potential spot for the earth attribute ancient power.<br> The White Star could openly invade the Roan Kingdom, but Cale had thought it was more likely for him to stealthily have his subordinates infiltrate the Roan Kingdom's northwest region.</p> 
 <p>That was why Alberu had sent people throughout the Roan Kingdom’s northwest region to look for suspicious people.</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>They seems to be the White Star’s subordinates as we expected.<br> “I see. In that case-”</li> 
  <li>That is why I am busy. I will send the important info via messages.<br> “Excuse me?”</li> 
  <li>I'm busy. Until later then. Take care of your body.</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>Click.</p> 
 <p>The call ended.<br> Cale was silent for a moment.</p> 
 <p>Ooooooooong-</p> 
 <p>He heard the video communication device go off again. It happened as Cale was about to turn back toward the video communication device expecting it to be Alberu's message.</p> 
 <p>“…How-! How did you already!”</p> 
 <p>He could hear Elisneh’s piercing scream.<br> Elisneh who was shocked after seeing that Cale was awake was heading toward him with the shamans. Cale's gaze headed toward them.</p> 
 <p>“The young master-nim is awake! Block them!”<br> “The Commander-nim is awake! Increase the speed even more and focus on getting out of here!”</p> 
 <p>Tasha and Jeet thought about Cale’s condition and gave orders to their respective subordinates.<br> Elisneh was still looking at Cale with a shocked expression. She seemed even more shocked than when Choi Han had come out of her illusion.</p> 
 <p>“T, t, that sir said that it was an illusion that would make a person face their greatest fear-!”</p> 
 <p>‘It wasn’t much of a fear.’</p> 
 <p>Cale snorted. He did not see Choi Han’s vicious gaze or invisible Raon's sparkling eyes because he was looking at Elisneh.</p> 
 <p>“Ugh!”</p> 
 <p>He suddenly heard a suppressed groan.<br> Cale looked toward the direction of the groan in shock. He saw someone flying away at a distance.</p> 
 <p>Boom!</p> 
 <p>The shaman with glasses fell to the ground and rolled. He looked limp as if he had fainted, and the person who had kicked him pulled out his sword.</p> 
 <p>“Three left.”</p> 
 <p>Choi Han said that as he headed toward Elisneh and the shamans. He said one more thing as he moved.</p> 
 <p>“Please get some rest.”</p> 
 <p>Of course, he had thrown the video communication device to Cale. </p> 
 <p>Shhhh.</p> 
 <p>The black tree’s branches made a gap to catch the video communication device and handed it to Cale.</p> 
 <p>“Ho.”</p> 
 <p>Cale gasped while looking at what happened. He then had an odd expression on his face.</p> 
 <p>‘…It looks like they’ll be able to take care of most bastards on their own even without me.’</p> 
 <p>He thought that things might get a little easier for him as he looked down at the video communication device. He needed to check the crown prince’s message.</p> 
 <p>He then became anxious.</p> 
 <p>Beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep-</p> 
 <p>The sharp noise of an alarm echoed in his ear and made Cale's face freeze.</p> 
 <p>“…As I expected.”</p> 
 <p>He bit down on his lips for a moment after seeing who was calling.<br> He had expected it. That was why he connected the call immediately.<br> He had an ominous feeling about this red light that was even brighter than the one from Alberu earlier.</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Human, I'm connecting it right away!</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>Cale nodded his head and looked toward the screen with concern.<br> It must be an emergency if this person was calling.</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Cale-nim.</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>Clopeh Sekka's cold and stiff face appeared on the screen.</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>We found Lion King Dorph in the forest near the Lake of Despair.</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>Cale’s eyes started to sink after hearing that what he expected but didn't want to happen was happening.</p> 
 <hr> 
 <p>“Cale-nim, we found Lion King Dorph in the forest near the Lake of Despair.”</p> 
 <p>Clopeh Sekka sent that message as he looked down.</p> 
 <p>“Captain-nim.”<br> “Quiet.”</p> 
 <p>He quieted his subordinate. His cold gaze was looking at a spot on the ground.</p> 
 <p>‘It is as Cale-nim expected.’</p> 
 <p>Cale and crown prince Alberu had contacted Clopeh a few days ago to talk about an urgent need to cooperate.<br> It was not for the Paerun Kingdom but just for Clopeh.</p> 
 <p>&lt; We believe it is highly likely that the White Star's subordinates will infiltrate the Lake of Despair, one of the Five Forbidden Regions. We are requesting your cooperation during that situation. &gt;</p> 
 <p>Clopeh recalled the contents of that contract.</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>It is as I expected.</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>Cale’s voice sounded cold and low.<br> Cale had been worried about something while planning the trip to the fake World Tree.</p> 
 <p>‘The Elves already tried and failed once.’</p> 
 <p>The reason for it was the dead mana liquid.<br> Cale had thought about this attempt through the White Star's perspective instead of the Elves.<br> He would think that the Elves would attempt to come to destroy the fake World Tree again.</p> 
 <p>‘He probably expected for me to be involved as well.’</p> 
 <p>Cale had a connection with the Elves after saving the Ten Finger Mountains’ Elf Village in the past.<br> The White Star's side would have expected the Elves to ask for Cale’s help and that they would come in large numbers.<br> That was why once they thought about Cale and the Elves coming to the Eastern continent…</p> 
 <p>‘They would have expected the Western continent to be empty as well.’</p> 
 <p>If Cale was the White Star, he would try to protect the fake World Tree while attempting to destroy the real World Tree at the same time.<br> That suspicion was correct.</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>You remember our plan?</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>Clopeh gave a short, ‘yes, Cale-nim,’ in response.<br> He had naturally agreed to take part.<br> It helped that the contract had discussed the benefits for Clopeh, but…</p> 
 <p>‘…Most importantly, it is getting involved in the path of a legend.’</p> 
 <p>“Keke.”</p> 
 <p>The corners of Clopeh’s mouth slowly started to go up.<br> An unbearable level of passion-filled him up.<br> Cale had sent him a separate message along with the contract.</p> 
 <p>&lt; I told a few wyverns to follow you for a set amount of time. &gt;</p> 
 <p>Of course, Choi Han was actually the one to order the wyverns.</p> 
 <p>&lt; The wyverns will follow your orders. You may use the wyverns as you please in addition to our request during that time. &gt;</p> 
 <p>Clopeh licked his lips with his tongue.</p> 
 <p>‘I should be able to organize the north a bit after taking care of this situation.’</p> 
 <p>His eyes sparkled.<br> Someone else was the hero and the legend, but shouldn't he at least be the ruler of the north?</p> 
 <p>He opened his mouth to speak.</p> 
 <p>“We are going down.”</p> 
 <p>There were tens of wyverns. The knights on top of those wyverns started to quickly descend to the spot Clopeh pointed out.</p> 
 <p>Clopeh also headed down to the forest.<br> He heard Cale’s voice at that moment.</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Win. If you can't win, persist. Persisting for as long as possible is the most important part.<br> “Yes, Cale-nim.”</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>‘I need to help out in writing a page in your legend.’</p> 
 <p>Clopeh turned toward a direction.<br> He saw Lion King Dorph who looked just as Cale described, quickly moving toward the Lake of Despair with the Lion tribe.</p> 
 <p>“Mm!”</p> 
 <p>He could see Dorph being shocked to see the descending Clopeh.<br> He had a twisted smile on his face.</p> 
 <p>“Ugh! Looks like you found us.”</p> 
 <p>Clopeh immediately gave an order to the knights.</p> 
 <p>"Get ready!”</p> 
 <p>The knights tightened their grips. Their arms and shoulders swung back with long steel spears in their hands.</p> 
 <p>“Throw!”</p> 
 <p>The long spears flew toward the forest once Clopeh gave the order.</p> 
 <p>“You bastards!”</p> 
 <p>Dorph had recognized Clopeh right away. A dark barrier was created by his hands.<br> The rest of the Lions took out shields or hid behind trees to dodge the spears.</p> 
 <p>Baaaaaang!<br> Boom- boom! Bang! Baaaaang!</p> 
 <p>Dorph’s’ black barrier and the knights’ long spears crashed and caused quite some loud noises.</p> 
 <p>“Ugh!”</p> 
 <p>Dorph frowned after blocking the long spears and then glared at the person coming down toward the forest.</p> 
 <p>“…Clopeh Sekka.”<br> “Oh. You know who I am?”</p> 
 <p>Clopeh put on his holy-looking knight’s smile.<br> Dorph looked relaxed again as he snorted toward Clopeh.</p> 
 <p>“Ha! Clopeh Sekka! Do you even know what is here? You bastard.-”<br> ‘That’s none of my business.”<br> “…What?”</p> 
 <p>Clopeh didn’t’ know what was in the Lake of Despair.<br> However…</p> 
 <p>“I'm just helping out in the path of a legend. I don’t care about anything else.”<br> “…What kind of, this crazy bastard-”</p> 
 <p>Dorph shouted with a shocked expression.</p> 
 <p>“You're supposed to be the Guardian Knight of the North but you just do whatever Cale Henituse orders you to do?”</p> 
 <p>The smile disappeared from Clopeh's face at that moment.<br> Clopeh started to speak with a stoic expression as a calm but firm voice flowed out.</p> 
 <p>“You're so stupid.”<br> “…What?”<br> “What reason do you need to help out in the process of a legend and a hero being created?”</p> 
 <p>The corners of Clopeh's lips rose again and his eyes started to sparkle.<br> Before Dorph could think that he had the gaze of a lunatic…</p> 
 <p>Rustle. Rustle.</p> 
 <p>As he heard the sound of leaves…</p> 
 <p>Baaaaaang!</p> 
 <p>Some trees were split in half as a whip burst out between them.</p> 
 <p>Flick-</p> 
 <p>The whip instantly grabbed one of the Lions who were hiding behind a tree to avoid the long spears.</p> 
 <p>Baaaaang!</p> 
 <p>“Ugh!”</p> 
 <p>The Lion groaned after they heard the noise.</p> 
 <p>The Lake of Despair and the World Tree.<br> Clopeh Sekka was Cale’s first safety net to protect this place.<br> The second safety net had now appeared as well.</p> 
 <p>Dorph started to speak.</p> 
 <p>“…The Whale has come out of the water.”</p> 
 <p>The Ruler of the Ocean, Witira had appeared through one of the split trees.</p>
