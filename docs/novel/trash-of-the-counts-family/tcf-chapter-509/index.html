 <p>A mountain range located on the northern part of the Eastern continent. A person who arrived at that location bent down.<br> He then cautiously sniffed the scent of the mountain in front of him.</p> 
 <p>The person's numerous years of experience helped him realize something.</p> 
 <p>“…It smells fishy.”</p> 
 <p>Cold air was coming down from the mountain.<br> His intuition was telling him that something was off.<br> He heard a calm voice next to him.</p> 
 <p>“It seems to be covered in the scent of blood.”</p> 
 <p>Choi Han commented before turning his head to look at the man behind him.</p> 
 <p>“Cale-nim, I have a bad feeling about this.”</p> 
 <p>Ron who had smelled the scent of blood stood up straight and reported to Cale.<br> Cale quietly observed the two of them before quietly asking Beacrox a question.</p> 
 <p>“Beacrox, did you smell the scent of blood too?”<br> “…Young master-nim, do you really think they could smell blood even though the mountain is so tall and wide? It is just intuition. Intuition.”</p> 
 <p>Beacrox responded with a stoic expression before turning away from Cale. Cale thought this was very fitting of Beacrox's personality as he started to speak.</p> 
 <p>“It’s too quiet.”</p> 
 <p>The bottom of the mountain.<br> Originally, mage Glenn Poeff and the mercenaries he brought with him should have been stationed here waiting for Bud to contact them.</p> 
 <p>However, there was nobody here.<br> All they could see were traces of people who were waiting here before rushing up the mountain.</p> 
 <p>He recalled what Bud told him.</p> 
 <p>‘The entire mountain was under an illusion.’<br> ‘Now that the illusion is gone, the entire mountain is covered in enemies.’<br> ‘…Help me.’<br> ‘Please quickly help me.’</p> 
 <p>Cale's gaze started to sink.<br> The golden top's whip in his hand started to glow.</p> 
 <p>“We are going to enter the mountain now.”</p> 
 <p>The enemies had cast an illusion.<br> That must mean that there was an illusionist here as well.<br> Furthermore, that illusion was supposedly destroyed.<br> He was tired of illusions now.</p> 
 <p>There were also so many enemies that they could cover the entire mountain.<br> The Mercenary King's mercenaries and the Elves Cale gathered numbered in the hundreds, but the Mercenary King seemed to have determined that the enemies overwhelmingly outnumbered them.</p> 
 <p>Bud was probably right.<br> He was the Mercenary King who had experienced many battlefields.</p> 
 <p>“…That is why we can't just go up without a plan.”</p> 
 <p>The mountain was so high that the peak was covered in snow.<br> This was the largest mountain in the mountain range that blocked the cold air from the north from reaching south, so, it was naturally tall and wide.</p> 
 <p>That was why they could not just go up as is.</p> 
 <p>“Young master-nim.”</p> 
 <p>The Molan household’s assassins were quietly standing like shadows behind Ron and Beacrox.<br> This group of assassins was half of the assassins who had infiltrated the Molden palace earlier. They had urgently rushed over along with Ron.</p> 
 <p>“Our preparations to infiltrate the mountain are completed.”</p> 
 <p>Ron had expressed it as an infiltration not to a castle or a residence, but to a mountain.<br> It might seem as if he used the wrong word, however, it was accurate.<br> Cale opened his mouth to call someone.</p> 
 <p>“On.”</p> 
 <p>He had someone who could trick people and hide their presence using a different method than illusions.</p> 
 <p>“Meeeeeow-!”</p> 
 <p>On and Hong stopped rubbing their bodies on Cale’s legs and looked up at him. White smoke started to surround On before spreading out.<br> She seemed to have understood Cale’s intentions as she had prepared to use her fog in advance.<br> Cale had asked Raon to quickly bring On and Hong over.</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Human, are we going in?</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>Cale took a step toward the mountain.</p> 
 <p>"We are infiltrating the mountain.”</p> 
 <p>It was quiet at the foot of the mountain, but they might hear weapons clashing or people screaming once they entered.<br> Furthermore, the chances of those screams belonging to their allies were high.</p> 
 <p>“Our first goal is to reinforce our allies and save them.”</p> 
 <p>Cale entered into the forest.<br> The shadows of the trees made the forest dark even though it was day time.</p> 
 <p>It was an urgent situation right now.<br> That was why Cale gave an order that was different than usual.</p> 
 <p>“Our second goal… Is to get rid of the enemies.”</p> 
 <p>The gazes on the faces of the assassins of the Molan household quickly changed.</p> 
 <p>“Our third goal is to identify the enemies, however, if that may lead to injuries… Then we will immediately escape or focus on our second goal.”</p> 
 <p>Both the first and second goals were focused on saving as many of their allies as possible.<br> Ron walked over toward Cale without making any noise and then asked.</p> 
 <p>“Young master-nim, which direction do we need to go?”</p> 
 <p>Squeeze.</p> 
 <p>Cale tightened his grip.</p> 
 <p>Ooooooong-</p> 
 <p>The top's whip in his hand was continuing to shake unlike usual.<br> Cale heard two of the three Wind Elementals that always moved around with him. One was with the Elves in the mountains right now.</p> 
 <p>‘C, chaos, destruction, anger! Elementals are screaming all over the mountain!’<br> ‘I hear Elementals fighting all around the mountain! No, that’s not it; they seem to be running away!’</p> 
 <p>The Elementals sounded more frantic than ever before.</p> 
 <p>‘I can’t hear the one we left here at all! I think it’s in a dangerous situation too!’<br> ‘This is bad! Chaos, destruction, disorder!’</p> 
 <p>Although the Elementals were frantic, Cale was calm.<br> Of course, his heart was beating wildly as well. He was in a hurry as well.<br> He imagined the Elves getting injured as the Wind Elementals told him that they heard Elementals screaming.</p> 
 <p>Cale bit down on his lips.<br> He was currently the commander of the Elves. He could not forget about the responsibilities that came with the role.</p> 
 <p>‘Chaos, destruction! The screaming seems to be slowly heading toward the center of the mountain!’</p> 
 <p>‘This is it!’</p> 
 <p>Cale’s eyes started to sparkle.</p> 
 <p>‘Cale, The Elementals’ screams are slowly heading toward the center of the mountain.’</p> 
 <p>‘I found it.’</p> 
 <p>He had found the information he was looking for.</p> 
 <p>If the screams were slowly heading toward the center of the mountain…<br> The meaning behind those words appeared in Cale’s mind.</p> 
 <p>The Elementals should be with the Elves.<br> The Mercenary King should be with the Elves as well.<br> It meant that their allies were slowly moving toward the center of the mountain.<br> They were moving in that direction while the Elementals are screaming.</p> 
 <p>‘That means that they are not moving there out of their own free will. Someone else is making them move there.’</p> 
 <p>They were not gathering together by choice.<br> It meant that numerous enemies were herding their allies to the center.<br> There was only one explanation for it.<br> Cale started to speak.</p> 
 <p>“…Battue.”</p> 
 <p>The enemies were herding their allies to one location. They were doing that to either hunt them down or with another goal in mind.<br> That other goal was definitely not good either.</p> 
 <p>The air around Cale turned cold.</p> 
 <p>Unlike how the group's fighting spirit had gone up and heated the air around them earlier… The air was now getting colder as their fighting spirit went up.</p> 
 <p>The assassins’ gazes turned cold.<br> Ron’s gaze sunk the most.<br> Mercenary King Bud. The Poeff household's Glenn Poeff.<br> Ron was quite concerned about them as he had his base on the Eastern continent.</p> 
 <p>Battue.</p> 
 <p>The others realized what was going on as soon as they heard that word.<br> Cale noticed that was the case, however, he still started to speak.</p> 
 <p>"Our allies and the enemies are gathering toward the center of the mountain.”<br> “Will we head over to save the allies right away?”</p> 
 <p>Beacrox asked as he was unable to be patient any longer.<br> They all looked ready to charge forward to save their allies at any moment.<br> However, Cale shook his head.</p> 
 <p>“…Cale-nim.”</p> 
 <p>Choi Han quietly called out to him.<br> Cale had a smile on his face even though this was an urgent situation. His smile looked angry.</p> 
 <p>The enemies were using battue on the allies.<br> That was why he would make them realize something.</p> 
 <p>If the enemies were using battue… ‘I'll use battue on you bastards.’</p> 
 <p>Cale started to speak.</p> 
 <p>“We will strike the enemies that are gathering our allies to a single spot from the back.”</p> 
 <p>Ron's eyes clouded over.<br> Just like how their allies were gathering to one spot…<br> The enemies that were herding them over were gathering toward one spot as well.</p> 
 <p>Cale looked down.<br> He could see On and Hong.<br> Raon was probably nearby while remaining invisible as well.<br> Cale did not plan on letting any more allies get hurt.</p> 
 <p>‘We will strike the enemies that are gathering our allies to a single spot from the back.<br> But we will not show ourselves.’</p> 
 <p>“We will hide behind magic, fog, and poison to stealthily strike the enemies from behind.”</p> 
 <p>The children averaging nine-years-old all responded.</p> 
 <p>Tata tap.</p> 
 <p>On kicked off the ground and climbed up a tree before looking down at Cale. Hong was next to her as well.</p> 
 <p>“Meeeeeeeeeeow!”<br> “Meeow-”</p> 
 <p>That meant that they were ready.</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Human! Do not worry! We will flip everything over with the poisonous fog! We will hide grandpa Ron and all of his subordinates as well!</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>An illusion. There were things other than illusions that could trick people.</p> 
 <p>“On, I leave it to you.”</p> 
 <p>The silver kitten nodded her head. The calm On would lead the children averaging nine-years-old without letting them get hurt.<br> Cale needed the children’s help, but he was still going to make them act from the rear where it was safe.</p> 
 <p>Shhhhhhhhhhhhhh-</p> 
 <p>The fog surrounding On became thicker and started to spread.<br> On and Hong became covered in fog such that they were no longer visible.</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Human! I am hiding in the fog as well!<br> "We're ready!”</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>Cale heard Raon and Hong’s voices through the fog and started to speak again.</p> 
 <p>“Choi Han.”<br> “Yes, Cale-nim.”</p> 
 <p>Choi Han stood next to Cale.</p> 
 <p>“You are heading toward the center with me. Our goal is to get there before the enemies or our allies.”<br> “Understood.”</p> 
 <p>Whirlwinds appeared at the tips of Cale’s feet as he activated the Sound of the Wind.</p> 
 <p>“We'll head there first.”</p> 
 <p>Cale started to head toward the forest with Choi Han.</p> 
 <p>“Ron. I'll tell you the enemies’ locations through Raon, so use that information to surround them.”</p> 
 <p>Cale was planning on sending a Wind Elemental to inform Raon about the enemies’ locations.<br> He had informed Raon about it on their way here, so there shouldn't be any issues.</p> 
 <p>“Do not worry about it. Young master-nim.”</p> 
 <p>Cale turned around only to see the assassins disappear into the shadow of the forest.</p> 
 <p>Shhhhhh-</p> 
 <p>All he could hear were leaves rustling.<br> Beacrox disappeared as well and only Ron, as well as the growing fog, remained.</p> 
 <p>Shaaaaaaa-</p> 
 <p>The fog then covered Ron as he benignly informed Cale.</p> 
 <p>“I guess it is time to do some shadow hunting.”</p> 
 <p>This was the fighting style for the assassins of the underworld.<br> Ron started to smile.</p> 
 <p>“Pfft.” </p> 
 <p>Cale chuckled before turning his head and heading toward the location that the enemies were herding their allies.<br> Of course, he still shared his sentiments about Ron's comment.</p> 
 <p>“So vicious.”</p> 
 <hr> 
 <p>Shhhhhhhhhhh-</p> 
 <p>Cale and Choi Han were quickly climbing the mountain without resting.</p> 
 <p>‘…Cale-nim.’</p> 
 <p>Choi Han was about two steps behind Cale as Cale was in the front finding the path.</p> 
 <p>Ooooooooong-</p> 
 <p>The golden top's whip was vibrating as the Wind Elementals told Cale the direction of where the Elementals were screaming.</p> 
 <p>‘Chaos, destruction! It is the center of the mountain but slightly higher than the actual center! It is right underneath the area with the snow!’<br> ‘Cale, I will go deliver that message to Raon-nim!’</p> 
 <p>The two Wind Elementals were more rushed than Cale.</p> 
 <p>“Mm!”</p> 
 <p>Cale who was quickly rushing past the forest was scratched by a branch and his cheek started to bleed.</p> 
 <p>“Cale-nim.”</p> 
 <p>Choi Han who was shocked by Cale’s quiet groan started to speak.<br> It could not be helped.<br> Cale looked more frantic than usual as they were heading toward where their allies were presumed to be gathering.<br> Of course, Choi Han understood how Cale was feeling.</p> 
 <p>‘…1,001 people have already gone missing here.’</p> 
 <p>This was where the Mercenaries Guild's Ranger Brigade had instantly gone missing.</p> 
 <p>‘Also…there were the things we saw on our way up.’</p> 
 <p>They were moving quickly, but both Cale and Choi Han had observed their surroundings as they moved.</p> 
 <p>Blood.</p> 
 <p>They saw a lot of blood on the trees and boulders as they started to climb the mountain.<br> Whose blood would it be?<br> They couldn't help but speed up as they thought about that.</p> 
 <p>However, Choi Han had to think about Cale's health as well.<br> Forget Cale not getting hurt, Choi Han realized that they could not let Cale become unconscious after hearing about Bud’s situation and the Whale tribe's battle.<br> There were a lot of battles going on right now.</p> 
 <p>Cale was the brain.<br> The brain was the center of all reactions.<br> That was why he could not get injured nor push himself too hard.</p> 
 <p>“Cale-nim, aren’t you overdoing it?”</p> 
 <p>He took two quick steps to move next to Cale.</p> 
 <p>“Hold on.”</p> 
 <p>Shhhh. </p> 
 <p>Cale’s arm blocked Choi Han.</p> 
 <p>“Cale-nim! Where-?”</p> 
 <p>Choi Han could see Cale stop him before starting to move in a different direction.<br> He quickly chased behind him.</p> 
 <p>Shhhhhhhhhhh-</p> 
 <p>Cale was moving past the leaves and grass and headed somewhere other than their destination.</p> 
 <p>‘Chaos, destruction! I heard a weird noise!’<br> ‘It is a human-shaped life form! It's breathing is very weak!’</p> 
 <p>The two Wind Elementals were saying there was someone nearby.</p> 
 <p>‘I will go take a look! Chaos, destruction, urgent, urgent!’</p> 
 <p>One of the Wind Elementals headed there first and Cale increased his speed as well.</p> 
 <p>The allies and enemies were all headed toward one spot right now.<br> However, there was someone who was apart from the rest.<br> It could be the enemy, but…</p> 
 <p>‘They said that person is breathing weakly.’</p> 
 <p>Weak breathing could mean that there was an enemy hiding and holding their breath down.</p> 
 <p>‘They also said that they heard a weird noise.’</p> 
 <p>That meant the chances of it being a hiding enemy was low.<br> It was more likely to be someone who was injured and groaning in pain.</p> 
 <p>That was why Cale could only consider one conclusion.</p> 
 <p>‘The Ranger Brigade!’</p> 
 <p>It might be one of the missing 1,001 people.<br> It could be a member of the Ranger Brigade who managed to avoid the enemies and the illusion and was hiding.<br> The Mercenary King was unable to find this person because of the illusion, but he might be able to find this person now that the illusion was destroyed.</p> 
 <p>‘I need to find them.’</p> 
 <p>He needed to find them, especially if it was one of the Ranger Brigade members.</p> 
 <p>If the noise the Elementals were hearing was weak, then he needed to find the person before they died.<br> Most importantly, he needed to find the person to hear what happened on the mountain.<br> Only then would he be able to understand the enemy's strength.<br> That would allow him to save the Mercenary King and the others in a safer way.</p> 
 <p>Cale started to use more of the Sound of the Wind because he still needed to quickly head to the Mercenary King as well.</p> 
 <p>‘I need to hurry!’</p> 
 <p>There were too many things he needed to do all at once.</p>
