 <p>Cale could feel Bae Puh Rum and Kim Min Ah following behind him.</p> 
 <p>Boom. Boom. Boom!</p> 
 <p>The snake-headed giant was walking toward them with its large club. This monster was over 3 meters tall.</p> 
 <p>“Roooooooar!”</p> 
 <p>The snake-headed giant raised its arm.</p> 
 <p>The black club headed toward the sky.</p> 
 <p>Its movement didn’t look slow at all.</p> 
 <p>In fact, it was much quicker than the snake wolf and the skeleton from earlier.</p> 
 <p>It also seemed much stronger as well.</p> 
 <p>Cale started to speak as Kim Min Ah and Bae Puh Rum gulped after seeing the club being raised.</p> 
 <p>His voice sounded very sharp.</p> 
 <p>“Bae Puh Rum! Take Kim Min Ah and move 2 meters to the left!”</p> 
 <p>Bae Puh Rum subconsciously grabbed Kim Min Ah and quickly moved about 2 meters to the left as if he was possessed.</p> 
 <p>It was much faster to fly slightly off the ground than to run.</p> 
 <p>Bae Puh Rum saw Cale moving 2 meters to the right at the same time.</p> 
 <p>‘That’s the opposite direction.’</p> 
 <p>Bae Puh Rum and Cale were moving in opposite directions.</p> 
 <p>Cale shouted once more at that moment.</p> 
 <p>“Kim Min Ah! Stab!”</p> 
 <p>Tap.</p> 
 <p>Kim Min Ah kicked off the ground as soon as she got away from Bae Puh Rum.</p> 
 <p>She could see Cale raising his spear on the right side as well.</p> 
 <p>His spear was heading for the giant’s right thigh.</p> 
 <p>In that short instant… Kim Min Ah and Cale made eye contact.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t think about the direction and just stab forward with all of your strength!”<br> “Ah.”</p> 
 <p>Kim Min Ah finally understood what Cale meant when he told her she didn’t need to control her ability.</p> 
 <p>She clenched her spear with both hands.</p> 
 <p>Oooooo-</p> 
 <p>Kim Min Ah could feel the immense amount of strength moving to her arms.</p> 
 <p>Her muscles became much firmer.</p> 
 <p>Crack.</p> 
 <p>The half-transparent spear in her hands slowly started to crack.</p> 
 <p>She then heard Cale's voice.</p> 
 <p>“Now!”</p> 
 <p>Kim Min Ah pushed her spear forward.</p> 
 <p>It was at that moment.</p> 
 <p>Baaaaaang-!</p> 
 <p>The giant’s club hit a spear.</p> 
 <p>Cale's spear had struck the giant’s club to make that loud noise.</p> 
 <p>The snake-headed giant had a pretty quick reaction speed.</p> 
 <p>That was why it had changed the direction of its club that had been heading down to respond to Cale’s attack.</p> 
 <p>Craaaack-</p> 
 <p>The water spear cracked before it was destroyed.</p> 
 <p>“Ugh.”</p> 
 <p>Cale’s body was pushed back.</p> 
 <p>But at that moment…</p> 
 <p>“Roooooooooar!”</p> 
 <p>The monster’s body twisted and it screamed.</p> 
 <p>Kim Min Ah looked down at her spear.</p> 
 <p>Driiiiiiiiiiiip.</p> 
 <p>The monster’s black blood dripped down from the spear that had pierced the giant’s thigh.</p> 
 <p>As long as it only had one club…</p> 
 <p>The monster could not dodge the attacks from both sides.</p> 
 <p>They came right after one another.</p> 
 <p>“…Holy shit… Isn’t that monster’s skin extremely thick?”</p> 
 <p>Lee Chul Min couldn't hide his astonishment as he watched.</p> 
 <p>It was the same for the others.</p> 
 <p>The scary thing about this snake-headed giant was its skin that they could not damage no matter how many times they attacked.</p> 
 <p>But if there was a spear with enough strength to pierce through it…</p> 
 <p>It was possible.</p> 
 <p>Kim Min Ah looked toward Cale.</p> 
 <p>Cale, who had stood back up as if he was never pushed back in the first place, created another water spear as he started to speak.</p> 
 <p>“You pierce. I defend. Or vice versa.”</p> 
 <p>Cale started to smile.</p> 
 <p>“Easy, right?”<br> “It’s very hard.”</p> 
 <p>A smile appeared for the first time on the stoic Kim Min Ah's face.</p> 
 <p>Cale charged toward the snake-headed giant again.</p> 
 <p>“Roooooooooar!”</p> 
 <p>The monster headed for Kim Min Ah who had injured it.</p> 
 <p>She heard Cale’s voice in his ear at that moment.</p> 
 <p>“Kim Min Ah, I’m not going to say anything anymore, so follow me with your eyes.”</p> 
 <p>Cale trusted Kim Min Ah's abilities.</p> 
 <p>“Stab as hard as you can without thinking about controlling it.”<br> “But it’s hard to control the direction.”<br> “Just stab when I tell you to stab.”</p> 
 <p>Kim Min Ah's weakness was in direction control.</p> 
 <p>Her spear was so strong that Kim Min Ah couldn’t control it to go where she wanted it to go at this point in time.</p> 
 <p>It was quite difficult to fight against moving monsters.</p> 
 <p>She might accidentally harm her allies or attack nearby buildings and cause chaos.</p> 
 <p>But Kim Min Ah realized something while looking at Cale.</p> 
 <p>‘…If that person makes the monsters stop moving! If the monster is standing still where this person tells me to stab…!’</p> 
 <p>Then her attack would work.</p> 
 <p>Cale moved toward the giant’s back and stabbed with his water spear as Kim Min Ah had those thoughts on her mind.</p> 
 <p>“Forward! Stab!”</p> 
 <p>Kim Min Ah followed Cale's voice and swung her spear from the front.</p> 
 <p>Their directions were opposite, but their movements were similar as if they were reflections.</p> 
 <p>Baaaaaaaaaang!</p> 
 <p>The giant’s club struck Kim Min Ah’s spear.</p> 
 <p>Kim Min Ah was not pushed back.</p> 
 <p>In fact, it was the giant that was pushed back.</p> 
 <p>And on the pushed back giant's back…</p> 
 <p>“Roooooooar!”</p> 
 <p>The water spear stabbed in.</p> 
 <p>“Hmm. I guess I really can’t do it?”</p> 
 <p>Cale’s spear did not manage to pierce the giant’s skin.</p> 
 <p>There definitely seemed to be some limits to this partial ancient power.</p> 
 <p>Craaaaaaack.</p> 
 <p>However, the giant's black club started to crack.</p> 
 <p>It was unable to withstand Kim Min Ah's power.</p> 
 <p>“Follow me.”</p> 
 <p>Cale immediately started to move again. His body was heading for the monster’s left ankle.</p> 
 <p>Kim Min Ah moved toward the right ankle.</p> 
 <p>“Stab!”</p> 
 <p>Kim Min Ah's spear stabbed deep into the giant’s right ankle.</p> 
 <p>Cale’s spear blocked the black club.</p> 
 <p>“…Wow…shit.”</p> 
 <p>Bae Puh Rum was blankly staring at this sight.</p> 
 <p>He then made eye contact with the moving Cale.</p> 
 <p>“Go bring the bird-headed snake over. That thing only goes for one person at a time.”<br> “Excuse me?”<br> “It’s behind you.”<br> “Mmph!”</p> 
 <p>Bae Puh Rum shot up into the air in shock.</p> 
 <p>“Shhhhhhh-!”</p> 
 <p>Bae Puh Rum could see a bird-head opening its beak and sticking out its snake tongue to where he had just been standing.</p> 
 <p>The bird's eyes looked toward Bae Puh Rum.</p> 
 <p>Bae Puh Rum got chills all over his body.</p> 
 <p>“Come toward me!”</p> 
 <p>He quickly headed toward Cale after hearing that.</p> 
 <p>The bird-head chased behind Bae Puh Rum with its beak open.</p> 
 <p>Shhhhhhhhhhhhhh-</p> 
 <p>The snake body moved very quickly. Bae Puh Rum felt as if the bird's beak was right behind his back.</p> 
 <p>‘Faster…! Faster!’</p> 
 <p>Bae Puh Rum used everything he had to fly even a tiny bit faster.</p> 
 <p>He didn’t know what was going on, but his speed was slowly starting to increase.</p> 
 <p>“…Holy shit!”</p> 
 <p>Bae Puh Rum arrived right in front of Cale who was holding his spear and aiming for the giant’s side.</p> 
 <p>Bae Puh Rum's pupils started to shake.</p> 
 <p>‘Didn’t he tell me to come here?’</p> 
 <p>He had come as Cale had mentioned, but Cale was calm.</p> 
 <p>“I'm going to crash like this!”<br> “Yeah. Don’t stop and keep coming.”</p> 
 <p>Bae Puh Rum started to frown. His speed was too fast for him to stop.</p> 
 <p>“Y…you!”</p> 
 <p>It was at that moment.</p> 
 <p>“Ride the wind.”</p> 
 <p>Cale moved to the side after saying that short statement. Bae Puh Rum's eyes opened wide.</p> 
 <p>The giant's side was now in front of Bae Puh Rum instead of Cale.</p> 
 <p>‘Damn it!’</p> 
 <p>He couldn’t even speak out loud.</p> 
 <p>‘Crash into the giant? Into a monster with such thick skin? Am I going to die?’</p> 
 <p>All sorts of thoughts filled Bae Puh Rum’s mind.</p> 
 <p>Swooooooosh-</p> 
 <p>He heard the sound of the wind.</p> 
 <p>“…Ah?”</p> 
 <p>Bae Puh Rum felt a whirlwind surrounding his body.</p> 
 <p>The wind was covering him.</p> 
 <p>‘Ride the wind.’</p> 
 <p>Bae Puh Rum noticed multiple whirlwinds gathering in front of him as he thought about what Cale had said.</p> 
 <p>They looked like shields surrounding Bae Puh Rum…</p> 
 <p>But also like arrows aiming for the enemy.</p> 
 <p>He was charging toward the giant as if he had become an arrow.</p> 
 <p>Bae Puh Rum’s instincts were telling him something.</p> 
 <p>‘I'm not going to get hurt.’</p> 
 <p>The wind, this large wind arrow, was giving Bae Puh Rum both relief and courage.</p> 
 <p>He only focused on the wind for now.</p> 
 <p>He focused on this free but firm and sharp wind.</p> 
 <p>Bae Puh Rum curled up.</p> 
 <p>It was at that moment.</p> 
 <p>Baaaaaang!</p> 
 <p>The wind arrow cradling Bae Puh Rum struck the giant.</p> 
 <p>“Roooooooooooar!”<br> “Ugh!”</p> 
 <p>As both Bae Puh Rum and the giant both groaned…</p> 
 <p>Cale shouted.</p> 
 <p>“Kim Min Ah!”</p> 
 <p>The giant and the Bae Puh Rum bounced off in different directions after crashing.</p> 
 <p>And in the spot where the two of them had disappeared…</p> 
 <p>There was another figure that was charging forward without being able to slow down.</p> 
 <p>And as for the person who had been standing still as Cale had told her to follow him…</p> 
 <p>Kim Min Ah’s eyes clouded over.</p> 
 <p>“Stab!”</p> 
 <p>Kim Min Ah stabbed her spear forward with everything she had as soon as she heard Cale’s voice.</p> 
 <p>Crackle.</p> 
 <p>She used so much strength that the cement underneath her feet started to crack.</p> 
 <p>"Screeeeeeeeeech!”</p> 
 <p>And the spear stabbed accurately into the mouth of the open bird’s beak.</p> 
 <p>As Kim Min Ah watched it happen…</p> 
 <p>Cale had approached her at some point, grabbed her, and quietly whispered as he moved her back.</p> 
 <p>“Push.”</p> 
 <p>She pushed the spear.</p> 
 <p>“Let go.”</p> 
 <p>She let go of the spear.</p> 
 <p>The spear pierced the bird-headed snake.</p> 
 <p>"Sss-ssss--”</p> 
 <p>The bird-headed snake fell on the ground without even being able to scream properly.</p> 
 <p>Blood was dripping out of its beak.</p> 
 <p>It then soon stopped moving.</p> 
 <p>Kim Min Ah quietly watched what had just happened.</p> 
 <p>“…I-”</p> 
 <p>‘Did I defeat that monster?’</p> 
 <p>Kim Min Ah's pupils started to shake.</p> 
 <p>Cale recalled some of his memories about Kim Min Ah.</p> 
 <p>Mother, brother, and Kim Min Ah.</p> 
 <p>That was her family.</p> 
 <p>Her mother had died from a monster attack.</p> 
 <p>“You won.”</p> 
 <p>She looked to the side after hearing Cale’s voice.</p> 
 <p>Kim Min Ah looked toward the angry snake-headed giant that was getting back up after falling down when Bae Puh Rum crashed into it.</p> 
 <p>“Now we just need to get rid of that thing?”<br> “That’s right. Let’s go.”</p> 
 <p>Cale took the lead and Kim Min Ah pulled out the spear that was sticking out of the monster’s body and followed behind him.</p> 
 <p>“Oh, I'm fine?”</p> 
 <p>Bae Puh Rum looked at his body that didn't have a single injury in shock as he followed behind them.</p> 
 <p>Actually, he moved in front of them.</p> 
 <p>The Sound of the Wind that Cale had created… Those whirlwinds were still by his side.</p> 
 <p>‘I knew he would figure it out quickly.’</p> 
 <p>Bae Puh Rum was slowly starting to understand the method of controlling the wind.</p> 
 <p>Kim Min Ah followed behind Bae Puh Rum who was moving in front of them.</p> 
 <p>Cale quietly watched the two of their backs.</p> 
 <p>Bae Puh Rum had quick speed, could change directions quickly, and act as a tanker.</p> 
 <p>Then there was Kim Min Ah who couldn't control the direction of her ability but the power behind it was scary.</p> 
 <p>These two were a great combination.</p> 
 <p>They would support each other.</p> 
 <p>Cale looked at their backs and started to speak.</p> 
 <p>“The two of you… If you are thankful for the things you learned from me… Help me out and go somewhere with me.”<br> “…Where?”</p> 
 <p>Bae Puh Rum asked and Kim Min Ah slightly looked back.</p> 
 <p>“Roooooooooar!”</p> 
 <p>The snake-headed giant was charging toward them.</p> 
 <p>But the two of them were not scared at all.</p> 
 <p>It was already injured in multiple places and looked ready to fall at any moment.</p> 
 <p>Cale opened his mouth to speak.</p> 
 <p>“Seomyeon, Busan. Go there with me.”</p> 
 <p>Cale was drawing an image in his mind.</p> 
 <p>Choi Han.</p> 
 <p>Lee Soo Hyuk.</p> 
 <p>Choi Jung Soo.</p> 
 <p>Kim Min Ah.</p> 
 <p>Bae Puh Rum.</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae.</p> 
 <p>The images of his allies who would take care of the attacking was slowly being created.</p> 
 <p>The couple looked confused after hearing an unexpected location. Cale shared his thoughts with them.</p> 
 <p>“I won't make you do anything dangerous. Think about it.”</p> 
 <p>The two of them tilted their heads in confusion before charging toward the snake-headed giant as dealing with this monster came first.</p> 
 <p>Cale also kicked off the ground and followed behind them.</p> 
 <p>‘It should end quickly.’</p> 
 <p>The snake-headed giant should soon fall to these two who were getting a feel for how to take care of it.</p> 
 <p>Cale looked farther south past the snake-headed giant.</p> 
 <p>The leader of the seven Grade 1 taster monsters.</p> 
 <p>The Dark Tiger that was a mix of a lion and a tiger was looking at Cale with a piercing gaze.</p> 
 <p>It was scary and looked as if it wanted to rip Cale up into pieces right now.</p> 
 <p>Cale looked right into its eyes as he started to speak.</p> 
 <p>“You know how to speak the human language, right?”</p> 
 <p>The Dark Tiger’s eyes opened wide as if it had read Cale’s lips.</p> 
 <p>Smirk.</p> 
 <p>Cale smiled while looking at its reaction.</p> 
 <p>Another record popped up in his mind.</p> 
 <p>&lt; The leader of the Grade 1 taster monsters is 1.5 times stronger than regular Grade 1 monsters and has a unique trait. &gt;<br> &lt; This was a trait that was only found in the leader of the taster monsters since the start of the cataclysm. &gt;</p> 
 <p>Since the cataclysm…</p> 
 <p>Only at this moment…</p> 
 <p>A trait only shown by the leader of the taster monsters.</p> 
 <p>A special power that would never appear again.</p> 
 <p>&lt; It was able to communicate. &gt;</p> 
 <p>The leader of the taster monsters was the only monster that could communicate with humans.</p> 
 <p>Cale smiled toward the Dark Tiger.</p> 
 <p>Cale then added the Dark Tiger to his list of allies that would make up the attack team to fight against the unranked monster.</p> 
 <hr> 
 <p>Alberu Crossman looked toward the person sitting across from him.</p> 
 <p>His eyes looked tired.</p> 
 <p>He also looked anxious.</p> 
 <p>The situation… An unexpected situation had happened.</p> 
 <p>‘…Damn it.’</p> 
 <p>The White Star had smacked him from behind.</p> 
 <p>Alberu Crossman had to come to a decision quickly.</p> 
 <p>Would he withdraw from the Endable Kingdom?</p> 
 <p>Or would he stay here until the end?</p> 
 <p>He then started to speak to the person who had come to see him.</p> 
 <p>“They want to make a deal?”</p> 
 <p>The person nodded their head.</p> 
 <p>“Yes, your highness.”<br> “…What’s the cost?”<br> “The curse that the Sun God placed on the Crossman blood.”</p> 
 <p>Alberu's eyes opened wide.</p> 
 <p>The curse that the Sun God placed on the Crossman household.</p> 
 <p>&lt; Descendants of the cursed blood. &gt;</p> 
 <p>&lt; The touch of the Sun God will always be by your side. &gt;</p> 
 <p>&lt; Never set your eyes on taking over the sky. &gt;</p> 
 <p>&lt; The Sun will always rise. &gt;</p> 
 <p>&lt; The moment darkness is planted in your bodies… &gt;</p> 
 <p>&lt; The moment a person with that darkness becomes the head of the household, the sky will be destroyed and the ground will tremble. &gt;</p> 
 <p>Alberu recalled the words he had read thousands of times.</p> 
 <p>His voice sounded very low.</p> 
 <p>“…How did you?”<br> “I happened to find out because of this incident.”</p> 
 <p>The person put on an awkward smile.</p> 
 <p>“Please don't worry as I will keep it a secret.”<br> “…Ha!”</p> 
 <p>Alberu was at a loss for words.</p> 
 <p>However, the person calmly continued to speak.</p> 
 <p>“Anyway, I was told you would receive an equivalent compensation if you place that on the scale for the deal.”<br> “…Is that what the God of Death told you?”<br> “Yes, your highness.”</p> 
 <p>Excommunicated priestess Cage nodded her head.</p> 
 <p>Alberu hesitated for a moment before starting to speak.</p> 
 <p>“But that’s beneficial for me.”</p> 
 <p>It was extremely beneficial if this curse was taken away.</p> 
 <p>Cage ended up learning his secret, but it would not matter if the curse was removed.</p> 
 <p>What could Cage do about a curse that did not exist?</p> 
 <p>That was why he found it odd.</p> 
 <p>“Why does the God of Death want such a thing?”</p> 
 <p>His eyes looked confused.</p> 
 <p>He knew that Choi Han had made a deal with the God of Death. He didn’t know the details and Choi Han didn't tell him what he had offered in return, but it couldn’t have been something small.</p> 
 <p>“What benefit does the God of Death get by taking the curse of my bloodline?”<br> “Gods are unable to personally help. That is why he wants to help in a different way.”</p> 
 <p>She shrugged her shoulders and mischievously responded.</p> 
 <p>“Gods love and cherish heroes. Especially heroes who have escaped their fate.”</p> 
 <p>She then quickly added on.</p> 
 <p>“But why do you think it is the God of Death who is offering this deal?”<br> “…Then?”<br> “The God of Death is only a messenger.”</p> 
 <p>Cage turned around and headed toward the entrance of the tent.</p> 
 <p>Flap.</p> 
 <p>She lifted the flap and someone walked in.</p> 
 <p>“…Saint Jack.”</p> 
 <p>Saint Jack smiled at Alberu after hearing his name.</p> 
 <p>“The Sun God wishes to take the curse back.”<br> “…Why?”</p> 
 <p>Saint Jack shook his head.</p> 
 <p>“I do not know the answer, however, he did tell me one thing.”</p> 
 <p>Jack repeated what the Sun God had told him.</p> 
 <p>“He said that, ‘I need to fix my mistake, the path that went wrong a long time ago.’ He also said that right now was the only time to do it. This is his only chance to do so.”</p> 
 <p>Cage handed Alberu a video communication device.</p> 
 <p>This video communication device looked different than regular ones as it had a perfect split of black and white.</p> 
 <p>“Should you agree to the deal, only you will be able to use this video communication device as the person making the deal. You'll be connected right away.”<br> “…You mean to Cale Henituse?”<br> “Yes, your highness.”</p> 
 <p>Cage gave a short response.</p> 
 <p>“This video communication device will become the only way to communicate with young master Cale.”</p> 
 <p>Alberu reached his hand out toward the video communication device.</p>
