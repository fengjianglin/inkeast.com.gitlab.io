 <p>“Min Ah, should we go down?”</p> 
 <p>Kim Min Ah who heard Bae Puh Rum's question was staring at Cale with a piercing gaze before she responded.</p> 
 <p>“Of course we are going down, how can we not?”</p> 
 <p>Bae Puh Rum nodded his head while looking south with a concerned gaze.</p> 
 <p>“Damn it. I hate snakes.”<br> “…The problem is that it is a snake-headed human.”<br> “Exactly.”</p> 
 <p>This monster that had the head of a snake but the body of a giant that could be seen in mythologies was approaching them.</p> 
 <p>Kim Min Ah looked at the other monster next to it while calmly speaking.</p> 
 <p>“…And the other has a head of a bird but the body of a snake.”</p> 
 <p>The two monsters were slowly approaching. They seemed to be enjoying a nice walk.</p> 
 <p>Bae Puh Rum pulled at his hair as he continued to speak.</p> 
 <p>“…What the hell do they want? Why did these monsters appear?”<br> “It just means it’s a terrible crisis.”<br> “Exactly! I'm scared of reptiles…”<br> “But isn't it doable since they’re both just half and half?”<br> “…Min Ah.”</p> 
 <p>Kim Min Ah looked away from Bae Puh Rum who sounded as if he wanted to cry.</p> 
 <p>She knew Bae Puh Rum was a punk who acted this way on purpose.</p> 
 <p>“Anyway, let’s go do-”</p> 
 <p>Kim Min Ah flinched as she was about to say that they should go down.</p> 
 <p>“What’s taking you so long?”</p> 
 <p>Cale was gently stepping on the ledge and walked onto the roof.</p> 
 <p>Swoooooooosh-</p> 
 <p>A light breeze was surrounding him like a whirlwind.</p> 
 <p>"Are you not coming down?”</p> 
 <p>Cale sounded as if he was saying they were walking to the convenience store just outside or something.</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae walked forward at that moment.</p> 
 <p>“Hey, Kim Rok Soo!”</p> 
 <p>Cale turned toward Park Jin Tae.</p> 
 <p>"I want to go next.”<br> “…I guess you're getting antsy?”<br> “Yeah.”</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae had his gun in his hand and looked extremely heated to fight.</p> 
 <p>“No.”<br> “What?”</p> 
 <p>However, Cale sternly shook his head.</p> 
 <p>“This monster matches well with the Kim Min Ah-Bae Puh Rum pairing.”<br> “…Them?”</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae started to frown.</p> 
 <p>“How can these children be useful? It’s better for me to go first.”</p> 
 <p>Cale reinterpreted Park Jin Tae's words.</p> 
 <p>“Are you saying children should stay back because it is dangerous while adults like you should fight, Mr. Park Jin Tae?”<br> “…What are you talking about?’</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae instantly started to frown and looked away from Cale.</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae then heard Kim Min Ah's voice.</p> 
 <p>“Hey mister, I'm stronger than you.”<br> “What?”</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae looked toward Kim Min Ah.</p> 
 <p>Kim Min Ah took out a hair tie and tied her straight hair into a ponytail as she continued to speak.</p> 
 <p>“I saw you fighting earlier, mister. I'm better than you.”</p> 
 <p>Bae Puh Rum scratched his head and walked in between Park Jin Tae and Kim Min Ah.</p> 
 <p>“Ahem, umm, hyung-nim? Min Ah, Min Joon-hyung, and I have survived with just the three of us. That should be all I need to say, right?”</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae started to smile after seeing Bae Puh Rum speak awkwardly but confidently.</p> 
 <p>“You pretended to be a fool on purpose.”</p> 
 <p>Bae Puh Rum awkwardly smiled in response. Kim Min Ah smacked Bae Puh Rum's back.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go down.”<br> “You're going down together.”</p> 
 <p>Kim Min Ah looked to one side.</p> 
 <p>Choi Han had put his hand on the decently healed Kim Min Joon's shoulder.</p> 
 <p>“I took care of the urgent parts. We can check on him later to make sure.”</p> 
 <p>Grandma Kim removed her hand from Kim Min Joon’s injury with a tired face.</p> 
 <p>Kim Min Ah's eyes opened wide.</p> 
 <p>The infected wound that had been covered in pus and blood still had left a scar, but it looked much better.</p> 
 <p>Her healing ability was shocking.</p> 
 <p>This was the reason Park Jin Tae and the others all listened to Grandma Kim even as they expanded their level of influence in the central shelter.</p> 
 <p>“Thank you, grandma.”<br> “No need to thank me.”</p> 
 <p>Grandma Kim shook her head at Cale and reached her hand out toward him.</p> 
 <p>“I'm okay.”</p> 
 <p>Cale took a step back.</p> 
 <p>“…You too-”<br> “It’s just a bruise.”<br> “On the corner of your mouth-”<br> “That is an internal injury.”<br> “……Okay.”</p> 
 <p>Cale nonchalantly wiped away the dried blood by his mouth.</p> 
 <p>Grandma Kim looked at him with a concerned expression before stepping back.</p> 
 <p>“Grandma.”<br> “Thank you, Jin Joo. Seung Won.”</p> 
 <p>Lee Jin Joo and Lee Seung Won helped to support Grandma Kim.</p> 
 <p>Cale approached the siblings.</p> 
 <p>“Hey, Seung Won.”<br> “Huh?”<br> “You come down too.”<br> “Me?”<br> “Yeah.”</p> 
 <p>Cale then looked toward Kim Min Joon.</p> 
 <p>“Mr. Kim Min Joon?”<br> “…Yes?”</p> 
 <p>He had heard about most of the situation while Bae Puh Rum carried him over. He had seen Kim Rok Soo take care of two Grade 1 monsters in less than thirty minutes while he was being healed.</p> 
 <p>“You’re able to use your ability, correct?”</p> 
 <p>Bae Puh Rum stepped forward after hearing Cale's question.</p> 
 <p>“Excuse me. Hyung-nim should probably-”</p> 
 <p>But Kim Min Ah grabbed his arm. Bae Puh Rum could see the cold look in Kim Min Ah's face.</p> 
 <p>She calmly started to speak.</p> 
 <p>“Oppa’s ability is not related to the injury at all. Also…”</p> 
 <p>She looked around the roof.</p> 
 <p>She could see the two approaching monsters and everybody looking at them.</p> 
 <p>“I don’t think it makes sense to try to get some rest in this situation.”</p> 
 <p>Kim Min Ah and Kim Min Joon made eye contact.</p> 
 <p>Kim Min Joon started to speak.</p> 
 <p>“That’s right. It’s an urgent situation.”</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae looked toward Kim Min Joon.</p> 
 <p>‘A military uniform.’</p> 
 <p>Although the clothes were a mess, he could tell it was a uniform. Even his shoes were military boots.</p> 
 <p>Kim Min Joon reached his hand out toward Choi Han.</p> 
 <p>Kim Min Joon had seen Choi Han’s sword art that had destroyed the Grade 3 monsters while on the other building with Kim Min Ah and Bae Puh Rum.</p> 
 <p>“Can you please help me?”<br> “Of course.”</p> 
 <p>Choi Han put Kim Min Joon on his back.</p> 
 <p>Cale looked toward Kim Min Joon and Lee Seung Won while starting to speak.</p> 
 <p>“Mr. Kim Min Joon and Mr. Lee Seung Won will move together during this battle.”</p> 
 <p>Cale continued to speak as Kim Min Joon looked toward Lee Seung Won.</p> 
 <p>“Lee Seung Won’s ability is recording…”</p> 
 <p>Kim Min Joon’s eyes clouded over at that moment.</p> 
 <p>“…And Mr. Kim Min Joon's ability is message.”</p> 
 <p>Cale pointed to his neck.</p> 
 <p>“Voice delivery.”</p> 
 <p>Lee Seung Won and Lee Jin Joo looked toward Kim Min Joon.</p> 
 <p>Cale quietly watched the three people looking at each other before turning around.</p> 
 <p>Boom!</p> 
 <p>The snake-headed giant's club struck down on the ground.</p> 
 <p>The two monsters that were slowly approaching had gotten close.</p> 
 <p>The two monsters stepped on the burnt corpses of the monsters from earlier.</p> 
 <p>Crack.</p> 
 <p>The corpses of the two monsters they had feared until now crumbled and turned into ashes.</p> 
 <p>People gulped while watching that before looking toward Cale.</p> 
 <p>Cale then patted someone's shoulder as he walked back to the ledge.</p> 
 <p>“Please come down and wait with Lee Chul Min. You are up next.”</p> 
 <p>Swoooooooosh-</p> 
 <p>He then headed down while being surrounded by the wind once again.</p> 
 <p>Bae Puh Rum followed behind him while carrying Kim Min Ah.</p> 
 <p>“…Lee Chul Min!”<br> “Yes, leader-nim!”<br> “Follow me!”</p> 
 <p>Lee Chul Min hesitated after hearing Park Jin Tae's order but followed behind him as if he had no choice.</p> 
 <p>Of course, Choi Han, Kim Min Joon, and Lee Seung Won were already going down the stairs.</p> 
 <p>Cale, Bae Puh Rum, and Kim Min Ah were already on the ground.</p> 
 <p>Gulp.</p> 
 <p>Bae Puh Rum became tense as soon as he saw the snake-headed monster and the snake-bodied monster getting closer.</p> 
 <p>‘They really are different.’</p> 
 <p>Unlike when he faced off against other monsters, just looking at these monsters made him fearful.</p> 
 <p>‘Can I win against that?’</p> 
 <p>Bae Puh Rum quickly started to think. He then looked toward Cale.</p> 
 <p>‘Mm!’</p> 
 <p>He made eye contact with Cale who was looking at him.</p> 
 <p>Pfft. </p> 
 <p>Cale chuckled while looking at Bae Puh Rum.</p> 
 <p>Cale was having this thought while looking at Bae Puh Rum.</p> 
 <p>‘It’s interesting seeing him this naive too.’</p> 
 <p>Bae Puh Rum.</p> 
 <p>He was a government worker in the newly created Korean Seoul Central Shelter ‘Ga’ Precinct.</p> 
 <p>Cale recalled what Kim Min Ah had told him in the past.</p> 
 <p>‘Bae Puh Rum? He's on paternity leave right now.’</p> 
 <p>Unlike the past where mayors and aldermen were elected, a new system of government officials was created after the cataclysms with the central shelters at the core.</p> 
 <p>Each precinct appointed a leader who was in charge of the administration.</p> 
 <p>Each leader of the central shelter was called the ‘Precinct Leader.’</p> 
 <p>“Umm, what do you want me to do?”</p> 
 <p>Cale put his hand on Bae Puh Rum who was cautiously asking him a question.</p> 
 <p>‘They said he’d be at the Precinct Leader level in ten years.’</p> 
 <p>Cale remembered that Bae Puh Rum was in charge of the Seoul Central Shelter ‘Ga’ Precinct's region defense as a section chief.</p> 
 <p>“…Something about bringing in the wind.”<br> “Excuse me?”</p> 
 <p>People had said that Bae Puh Rum controlled the wind as he moved.</p> 
 <p>“Bae Puh Rum.”<br> “Yes?”<br> “You use the wind to fly in the sky, right?”</p> 
 <p>Bae Puh Rum flinched at Cale’s question before awkwardly responding.</p> 
 <p>“Yes?”<br> “Have you not thought about using the wind in a different way?”<br> “I did, but it didn’t work too well. Haha.”</p> 
 <p>Pat. Pat.</p> 
 <p>Cale patted Bae Puh Rum's shoulder.</p> 
 <p>“Then watch what I do and try to do the same thing.”<br> “Excuse me?”</p> 
 <p>Bae Puh Rum asked back, but Cale didn’t pay him any attention.</p> 
 <p>Instead, he turned toward Kim Min Ah.</p> 
 <p>Kim Min Ah was observing the Grade 1 monsters with a sharp gaze. She seemed to be inspecting them.</p> 
 <p>Cale stood next to her as he started to speak.</p> 
 <p>“Use your ability to its maximum level.”</p> 
 <p>Kim Min Ah's shoulders started to shake.</p> 
 <p>She was still looking at the monsters as she started to speak.</p> 
 <p>“…But I can’t control it.”</p> 
 <p>The corners of Cale’s lips started to go up.</p> 
 <p>Kim Min Ah could not control her ability at this time.</p> 
 <p>She didn't know how to use it properly either.</p> 
 <p>That was why she could not fend off a single monster properly.</p> 
 <p>There was a requirement to be in charge of an attack team in the vanguard at the company where Kim Rok Soo was a team leader.</p> 
 <p>A Grade 1 Ability user specialized in attacking.</p> 
 <p>Kim Min Ah easily met that requirement.</p> 
 <p>Cale quietly continued to speak to her.</p> 
 <p>“I will control it for you.”</p> 
 <p>Kim Min Ah looked toward Cale.</p> 
 <p>Cale looked into her shaking pupils and continued to speak.</p> 
 <p>“All you need to do is use your ability as much as you want.”</p> 
 <p>Her shaking pupils calmed down.</p> 
 <p>Kim Min Ah quietly nodded her head.</p> 
 <p>“I'll give it a try.”</p> 
 <p>It was at that moment.</p> 
 <p>"W, what?”</p> 
 <p>Lee Chul Min’s eyes opened wide as he was about to walk out of the building through a window on the second floor.</p> 
 <p>He was looking at Kim Min Ah.</p> 
 <p>Boom!</p> 
 <p>The ground shook at that moment.</p> 
 <p>It was not because of the monsters’ footsteps.</p> 
 <p>A huge half-transparent spear had struck down on the ground.</p> 
 <p>There was a person holding onto that spear.</p> 
 <p>It was Kim Min Ah.</p> 
 <p>She was easily grabbing this spear that was three-times her height.</p> 
 <p>"Who is she?”</p> 
 <p>Lee Chul Min gasped in astonishment.</p> 
 <p>However, he couldn't say anything after seeing what happened next.</p> 
 <p>All he could do was stand there with his jaw dropped.</p> 
 <p>“…Crazy bastard.”</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae couldn’t help but swear.</p> 
 <p>Kim Min Ah looked to her side.</p> 
 <p>Her pupils started to shake.</p> 
 <p>“Just-”</p> 
 <p>Kim Min Ah couldn’t help but ask.</p> 
 <p>“Just who are you?”</p> 
 <p>She could see Cale in front of her.</p> 
 <p>Boom!</p> 
 <p>Another large spear struck down on the ground and caused the dust to rise.</p> 
 <p>Shaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-</p> 
 <p>Water was swirling to create a large spear.</p> 
 <p>The spear was pointing its sharp blade toward the sky as if it was going to pierce the sky.</p> 
 <p>A portion of the Sky Eating Water's power was being activated in Cale’s hand.</p> 
 <p>‘It really is weak.’</p> 
 <p>Cale could once again feel that only a portion of the ancient powers had been absorbed by his soul.</p> 
 <p>But he was not disappointed that it was weaker than usual.</p> 
 <p>The method the ancient powers gave him to make them stronger…</p> 
 <p>‘Gobble up our existences. Each time one of these voices disappears… You'll become stronger.’</p> 
 <p>Cale had rejected that method.</p> 
 <p>That was why he could feel the wills of the owners of the ancient powers and he could always be with them.</p> 
 <p>‘I'm sure they’ll throw a fit when I go back.’</p> 
 <p>Cale thought about how the Super Rock and the other owners of the ancient powers would be concerned about him once he returned to his original world.</p> 
 <p>Pfft.</p> 
 <p>Cale chuckled as he grabbed the spear.</p>
