 <p>He needed to first figure out today's date.</p>
 <p>‘I also need to check who is here.’</p>
 <p>He needed to figure out the people who would fight based on the present and his information of the future.</p>
 <p>And most importantly.</p>
 <p>‘I need to change myself first.’</p>
 <p>He needed to get his abilities awakened.</p>
 <p>However, an ability awakening was something nobody could predict.</p>
 <p>Cale’s abilities were only awakened after he started working for his company.</p>
 <p>That was why, realistically speaking, it would be close to impossible for Cale to awaken his future abilities as he pleased.</p>
 <p>‘…But I’ve experienced the sensation that comes with abilities being awakened.’</p>
 <p>It felt as if he was seeing a new world.</p>
 <p>If he thinks about that sensation and does similar things as to when his abilities actually awakened, couldn't he potentially get them awakened sooner?</p>
 <p>‘…It’s fine if my abilities don’t awaken while I'm at the central shelter, but it would be great to have them when I go up against the unranked monster.’</p>
 <p>Cale's expression stiffened and Grandma Kim tightly grabbed Cale’s hand that was over his stomach.</p>
 <p>Shaaaaaaaaaaa-</p>
 <p>Cale then saw a yellow light surround his stomach.</p>
 <p>He subconsciously started to speak with urgency.</p>
 <p>“Grandma, I'm okay!”<br>“You’re not okay.”</p>
 <p>Cale could feel the pain in his stomach disappear.</p>
 <p>Any bruises or injuries on his stomach probably healed right away.</p>
 <p>This was grandma’s healing ability.</p>
 <p>“…How can you use your power for such a useless thing?”</p>
 <p>Grandma Kim's abilities could only heal external injuries and had limited uses per week.</p>
 <p>She could use it as many times as she wanted for small injuries such as bruises, but she had a strict limit for injuries such as bone fractures or significant blood loss.</p>
 <p>The amount of healing power necessary was different based on the type of injury.</p>
 <p>That was why Park Jin Tae wanted Grandma Kim to use her powers for healing his precious attack team members who could fight against monsters.</p>
 <p>Grandma Kim smiled gently after hearing Cale's comment.</p>
 <p>“This is not useless, it is important.”</p>
 <p>The grandma got up and motioned for Cale to get up as well.</p>
 <p>“Hey, Rok Soo. Let's go inside.”</p>
 <p>Cale slowly raised his body after seeing that warm smile.</p>
 <p>He didn't have any pain anymore.</p>
 <p>“Hey, you stupid idiot!”<br>“Hyung!”</p>
 <p>Cale turned toward the voice calling out to him.</p>
 <p>He could see people rushing out of the shelter.</p>
 <p>Two students, one who seemed to be in college and the other in high school, rushed over and started to support Cale.</p>
 <p>“Hey, are you okay?”<br>“Hyung, are you okay?”<br>“Ah.”</p>
 <p>These people were here as well.</p>
 <p>Lee Jin Joo. Lee Seung Won.</p>
 <p>These two were siblings and ability users.</p>
 <p>‘Of course, they have abilities that other ability users look down on.’</p>
 <p>Their abilities were seen as useless abilities right now.</p>
 <p>‘…And these two.’</p>
 <p>They also died.</p>
 <p>Cale suddenly felt as if someone was clenching his heart and found it hard to breathe.</p>
 <p>“I'm fine.”</p>
 <p>But his face and voice did not show any signs of it.</p>
 <p>“Aigoo. Look at you acting all tough!”</p>
 <p>Lee Jin Joo snorted, but her eyes were full of concern as she checked to make sure Kim Rok Soo was okay.</p>
 <p>Cale gently pushed Lee Jin Joo and Lee Seung Won away and walked in front of them.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go inside.”</p>
 <p>The siblings blankly looked at Cale for a moment before shaking their heads and following him inside.</p>
 <p>“You should just let us support you. Why are you walking so slowly?”<br>“Hyung, we're going to go back in first! We came in the middle of work!”</p>
 <p>The people inside the central shelter all had work they needed to complete every day.</p>
 <p>Of course, those jobs were only given to people who had Park Jin Tae's approval.</p>
 <p>Kim Rok Soo did not have his approval, which was why they always tried to start shit with him in the name of running errands.</p>
 <p>“Isn't it so nice to see them relying on each other?”</p>
 <p>Grandma Kim smiled while looking at the siblings who were walking away.</p>
 <p>Cale looked at the siblings instead of responding.</p>
 <p>It made him think of On and Hong.</p>
 <p>“Grandma.”<br>“Hmm?”<br>"What is today's date?”<br>“Today?”<br>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>
 <p>Grandma Kim looked at him with confusion while wondering why he was asking such a thing before answering in a soft voice.</p>
 <p>“Today is the 24th.”<br>“October?”<br>“Yes? Why are you suddenly asking about the date?”<br>“Just because.”</p>
 <p>October 24th.</p>
 <p>Cale recalled today's date.</p>
 <p>“…Fuck.”<br>“…Hey, Rok Soo.”<br>“I'm sorry. I just suddenly thought of something that made me angry.”</p>
 <p>He smiled toward Grandma Kim who was looking at him with concern after hearing his coarse language.</p>
 <p>Grandma Kim, who had not seen Rok Soo smile in a while, opened her eyes wide in shock for a moment before gently smiling and nodding her head.</p>
 <p>Cale repeated the word in his mind as he continued to walk next to her.</p>
 <p>‘Fuck fuck fuck!’</p>
 <p>The only thing on his mind was swearing.</p>
 <p>In one day…</p>
 <p>During day time on October 25th…</p>
 <p>Central shelters around the world will be destroyed.</p>
 <p>It was the start date of the incident that would fill the hearts of the people who barely started to adjust to the changes since the cataclysm with despair.</p>
 <p>‘I only have one day?’</p>
 <p>Cale walked into the central shelter.</p>
 <p>“I'm going to go work now too.”</p>
 <p>Grandma Kim headed for her post while Cale took in the sight inside the central shelter.</p>
 <p>‘It really is the early stages.’</p>
 <p>There were a lot of different people doing their jobs on the first floor of the building.</p>
 <p>None of them paid any attention to Kim Rok Soo.</p>
 <p>‘They’re all busy doing their best to survive.’</p>
 <p>Cale continued to walk and headed for his spot.</p>
 <p>There was a fake wall that came up to his waist once he got past the entrance area.</p>
 <p>He could see people pretty much right next to one another once he got past that fake wall.</p>
 <p>These people were in a similar situation as Kim Rok Soo.</p>
 <p>They had not awakened their abilities and didn’t have any skills nor techniques that were necessary in the world right now.</p>
 <p>'Of course, people will realize that is not the case later on when society is revitalized.’</p>
 <p>They were also doing the work assigned to them.</p>
 <p>Step step.</p>
 <p>Cale walked past them and kept moving.</p>
 <p>The second floor of the central shelter was where the ability users and useful humans resided.</p>
 <p>The Lee siblings had a bedroom on the second floor.</p>
 <p>‘Well, it’s too shabby to call it a bedroom or lodging.’</p>
 <p>It was a time when any spot that allowed someone to escape the rain and wind was considered lodging and any nice cloth they could find was used as blankets.</p>
 <p>They were lucky to find enough food for one day.</p>
 <p>‘The Park Jin Tae group did share though.’</p>
 <p>Park Jin Tae and his lackeys went out to find food for the group.</p>
 <p>They did it while dodging and running away from monsters.</p>
 <p>‘They did fight against some, but unlike the future, this was a time when even grade 3 monsters were difficult to handle.’</p>
 <p>People had awakened their abilities but still could not use them properly.</p>
 <p>Abilities could be used for many things, and this was called 'development.’</p>
 <p>‘But right now is not the time to attempt that.’</p>
 <p>The foundations of society had crumbled.</p>
 <p>There wasn't even any electricity.</p>
 <p>They were surrounded by darkness every night.</p>
 <p>The only things that kept it from being completely dark at night were the fireplaces around the shelter that had fires that never went out.</p>
 <p>Cale looked down at his hands as he walked.</p>
 <p>‘They’re so skinny.’</p>
 <p>His body was extremely skinny right now.</p>
 <p>Park Jin Tae's lackeys only gave just enough so that they did not die.</p>
 <p>‘That’s the only way they can spread it out to everybody inside this shelter.’</p>
 <p>It was not easy to find food.</p>
 <p>Kim Rok Soo managed to survive on the bare minimum.</p>
 <p>‘The people of value received more food.’</p>
 <p>That was why the ability users who had good relationships with Kim Rok Soo would offer him some of their shares from time to time.</p>
 <p>‘…The world is not bleak.’</p>
 <p>Even though the times seemed hopeless, the hearts of the people living through it had not gone completely dark.</p>
 <p>That was why Cale didn't think Park Jin Tae was a bad person.</p>
 <p>‘There are many places that don't even give out food like this.’</p>
 <p>A lot of people didn't care whether others starved to death.</p>
 <p>In such a situation, although Park Jin Tae looked down and messed with people like Kim Rok Soo, he still gave them enough food to survive.</p>
 <p>‘Well, he does beat up resistant people like me though. No, he just really hated me.’</p>
 <p>But he still gave out enough so that their legs would have enough strength to run away if they ever ran into a monster.</p>
 <p>The bastard had turned this central shelter into his own kingdom, but he still kept himself humane.</p>
 <p>He did not cross the line a fellow human should not cross.</p>
 <p>He at least gave them their share of food.</p>
 <p>Cale had realized something about it once he became older.</p>
 <p>‘The fact that Park Jin Tae pushed the skillful people up might have been the reason this system was able to be maintained.’</p>
 <p>All societal systems had been destroyed at that time.</p>
 <p>How many ability users would want to share the food that they worked so hard to find?</p>
 <p>But since Park Jin Tae treated the ability users well, they stayed with this food sharing system.</p>
 <p>‘And Park Jin Tae is currently a very strong attack-type ability user.’</p>
 <p>There was a reason team leader Lee Soo Hyuk left the place to Park Jin Tae.</p>
 <p>Park Jin Tae was a very strong dealer and a decent tanker.</p>
 <p>Lee Chul Min and the others who followed Park Jin Tae were not bad for the early stages either.</p>
 <p>‘I will use Park Jin Tae.’</p>
 <p>Cale was slowly planning things in his mind.</p>
 <p>‘There’s also Grandma Kim, Jin Joo noona, and Seung Won.’</p>
 <p>There were also many other people he needed for this task.</p>
 <p>Cale returned to his spot.</p>
 <p>Kim Rok Soo’s spot in this central shelter…</p>
 <p>It was at the edge of the first floor.</p>
 <p>It was right next to a crumbling ceiling.</p>
 <p>It was right by the back door of the first floor.</p>
 <p>“…The rain leaked here.”</p>
 <p>Kim Rok Soo’s spot was the only spot in the building where rain leaked through the cracked ceiling.</p>
 <p>“Why are you talking to yourself like that?”</p>
 <p>He heard a voice at that moment.</p>
 <p>It was a husky and aged man's voice.</p>
 <p>“You chose that spot.”</p>
 <p>That was the case.</p>
 <p>Cale had chosen this spot as that person mentioned.</p>
 <p>Park Jin Tae placed the ability-less Cale to the first floor and he chose this leaking spot as his spot.</p>
 <p>"What's wrong? Do you suddenly want to move elsewhere? What happened to pretending like you were sacrificing yourself for the others?”</p>
 <p>Cale sighed and turned his head.</p>
 <p>“Hey mister. Why don't you go elsewhere if you want to talk shit?”<br>“Kekeke! Who says I'm talking shit?!”</p>
 <p>Cale looked toward the middle-aged man lying on the next spot.</p>
 <p>There was nothing under his knees.</p>
 <p>He was one of the people that team leader Lee Soo Hyuk had saved.</p>
 <p>His name was Jang Man Soo.</p>
 <p>“Hey! I heard you got beat up by Park Jin Tae and his gang. Are you okay?”</p>
 <p>Jang Man Soo raised his neck and leaned on the wall.</p>
 <p>“Those terrible bastards. Where is there even to hit such a skinny kid? They’ll be punished by the heavens!”<br>“It's fine. Grandma healed me.”</p>
 <p>Cale looked next to Jang Man Soo… and sat down in his spot.</p>
 <p>“Hmm? Grandma did? Aigoo, why does that grandma care about you so much? Why did she heal a good for nothing like you?”<br>“Are you saying you're upset that I got healed?”<br>“Oh come on~ Of course not. Kehehe! I just said it! It was a joke, a joke!”</p>
 <p>Cale quietly looked at Jang Man Soo who was joking with him.</p>
 <p>Jang Man Soo.</p>
 <p>He was someone who lost his entire family because of the cataclysm.</p>
 <p>He had a wife and two kids and was on his way to work when it happened.</p>
 <p>He barely managed to get back to his house only to see that all of them were already dead.</p>
 <p>He saw the monster that had killed his family there.</p>
 <p>He apparently ran for his life from monsters to get to his house.</p>
 <p>There had only been one thing on his mind as he did that.</p>
 <p>He was thinking that his family was alive at home and that he would take his family somewhere safe.</p>
 <p>But he charged toward the monster the moment he saw that his family was dead.</p>
 <p>The thought of running away never ever crossed his mind.</p>
 <p>He just felt as if he could only continue to live if he ripped the monster in front of him to pieces.</p>
 <p>The monster took both of his legs and Jang Man Soo was planning on dying.</p>
 <p>He didn't think there was a reason to live in this world without his family.</p>
 <p>But the team leader saved him and Jang Man Soo was someone who was barely alive and living on.</p>
 <p>“Hey mister.”<br>"What is it?”</p>
 <p>Cale quietly observed him before lowering his body.</p>
 <p>He got closer to Jang Man Soo.</p>
 <p>“Hey mister.”<br>“Why are you suddenly acting like this, you punk?”</p>
 <p>As Jang Man Soo looked toward Kim Rok Soo who was acting differently than normal with confusion…</p>
 <p>Cale quietly whispered.</p>
 <p>“Please help me out.”</p>
 <p>Jang Man Soo looked confused.</p>
 <p>“Me? You're talking to me? What help can I be? Did you go crazy after getting beaten up?”<br>“Mister.”</p>
 <p>Cale whispered quietly so that nobody else could hear.</p>
 <p>“Your ability awakened not too long ago, didn’t it?”</p>
 <p>Jang Man Soo's pupils started to shake.</p>
 <p>His jaw dropped and he looked astonished.</p>
 <p>Cale started to smile while looking at his reaction.</p>
 <p>It seemed to be a sad smile.</p>
 <p>Jang Man Soo also died in the past when the central shelter disappeared.</p>
 <p>He died fighting.</p>
 <p>‘Kehehe! I'm relieved! This time, I'm going first after protecting people!’</p>
 <p>His ability apparently awakened not long before the central shelter was destroyed.</p>
 <p>His memory of Jang Man Soo remained with Kim Rok Soo that once he became Cale…</p>
 <p>The first thing he chose to get was a shield.</p>
 <p>“Mister, your ability is a shield, right?”</p>
 <p>Jang Man Soo stiffened up and could not say anything.</p>
 <p>‘How did he realize that my ability awakened?’</p>
 <p>People didn't look different even after awakening their ability.</p>
 <p>That was why there was no way to tell unless they saw the person using the ability or the person told them.</p>
 <p>There were some ability users whose appearances changed with it, but Jang Man Soo's case wasn’t like that.</p>
 <p>‘But Kim Rok Soo realized that? And he knows what my ability is as well?’</p>
 <p>How could he not be astonished in such a situation?</p>
 <p>Cale whispered to him.</p>
 <p>"The central shelter will be destroyed soon.”<br>“W, what?!”</p>
 <p>His mouth that had closed back in shock dropped once more at this even more shocking comment.</p>
 <p>Jang Man Soo raised his voice with an extremely shocked expression.</p>
 <p>“Shh.”</p>
 <p>Cale quieted him down and whispered very quietly.</p>
 <p>“And I know where the new central shelter will appear.”</p>
 <p>‘What is this punk saying right now?’</p>
 <p>Jang Man Soo was looking at Kim Rok Soo as if he was looking at someone he had just met.</p>
 <p>“Mister.”</p>
 <p>But Kim Rok Soo's eyes were more serious than ever.</p>
 <p>One word after another.</p>
 <p>Each word that Kim Rok Soo said to him struck Jang Man Soo’s ear.</p>
 <p>“I plan on letting everybody here move to the new central shelter without dying.”</p>
 <p>Jang Man Soo barely managed to speak.</p>
 <p>“You- you, how do you know about those……?”</p>
 <p>Smile.</p>
 <p>Kim Rok Soo started to smile.</p>
 <p>“I got an ability too.”</p>
 <p>It was a very strong ability where he knew the future.</p>
