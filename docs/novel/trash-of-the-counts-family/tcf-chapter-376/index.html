 <p>Rustle.<br> A leaf crumbled under Cale's feet.</p> 
 <p>“…For such a place to really exist…”</p> 
 <p>Mercenary King Bud looked around in disbelief and could not hide his shock.<br> The group who slowly descended with Raon's flight magic had different emotions as they looked around.</p> 
 <p>“It's even bigger than the Underground City!”<br> “It really is! Wow! Wow!”</p> 
 <p>On and Hong had their jaws dropped as they looked around.</p> 
 <p>“…I expected it to be similar to the Underground City…”</p> 
 <p>Choi Han mumbled as he looked around.</p> 
 <p>The Dark Elves Underground City had many trees as well. There was even an artificial river.<br> It was all thanks to magic and Elementals.</p> 
 <p>Choi Han had looked at that Underground City and thought that it was a nice city.<br> It was a beautiful city where Dark Elves and humans could live together.</p> 
 <p>‘But this place is different.’</p> 
 <p>This village that was multiple times the size of the City of Life could be called natural.<br> It didn't give off any sense of it being created.<br> Everything in this region that was surrounded by these large cliffs on all sides looked natural.</p> 
 <p>“…It’s free.”</p> 
 <p>Choi Han nodded at Bud’s description and looked up.</p> 
 <p>There was a small orb that shined like the sun at the top of this large underground area.<br> Trees freely grew underneath it.<br> Flowers and other vegetation were freely growing as well.</p> 
 <p>It was not all beautiful.<br> There were some dead and rotting plants and fruits.<br> However, that was what made it look so natural.</p> 
 <p>Choi Han slowly turned a full circle.</p> 
 <p>This place was quiet, but full of life and freedom.<br> Paradise was definitely a fitting word for this place.<br> It didn't seem like the place to have wars nor anything of the sort.</p> 
 <p>“Cale-nim.”</p> 
 <p>Choi Han kept turning until he made eye contact with Cale. He subconsciously started to share his sentiments about this place.</p> 
 <p>“This place is beautiful.”<br> “Do you feel that way even after seeing that over there?”<br> “…Excuse me?”</p> 
 <p>However, Choi Han could see Cale's stiff expression.<br> He looked toward the place Cale pointed out.</p> 
 <p>Cale was pointing at a spot near the cave that the group just came from.</p> 
 <p>Choi Han looked at the cliff with the cave.<br> His expression stiffened up after looking at it.</p> 
 <p>He had not noticed it when they had descended close to the cliff.<br> He had just thought that it was a rough cliff.<br> It was because all of the other sides of the cliff looked normal.<br> Bud who looked at the cliff as well started to frown.</p> 
 <p>“…Are those letters?”</p> 
 <p>There were large lines on the cliff.<br> The lines looked so clear that they seemed as if they would never disappear.</p> 
 <p>“…This.”</p> 
 <p>Bud started to step backward.</p> 
 <p>Just a bit farther.<br> He needed to get farther away from the cliff.</p> 
 <p>He would be able to tell what these lines portrayed if he stepped back.</p> 
 <p>“Ah.”</p> 
 <p>Bud took many steps back before he could see the words written on the cliff.<br> They were written in the Eastern continent’s common language.</p> 
 <p>Bud read the words on the top row.</p> 
 <p>“Become strong. Then save the world.”</p> 
 <p>It was a sword.<br> He was certain that a sword was used to write these words on the cliff.<br> The person who did this had to at least be a sword master.<br> No, forget whether they could use aura or not, this person was extremely skilled in sword arts.</p> 
 <p>Bud drank some alcohol to wet his dry throat.<br> It could not be helped.<br> Underneath the first row that he read…<br> There were other words that he had not read yet.</p> 
 <p>“…These look like they were written by someone else.”</p> 
 <p>The style and calligraphy of the words underneath were different.</p> 
 <p>These people were able to write on the cliffs with swords as if they were using pens.<br> They needed to be extremely skilled to be able to do that.</p> 
 <p>He looked toward the others.<br> They had all been able to read the Mercenaries Guild’s directory using Eruhaben’s translation magic.<br> They should have seen these words as well.</p> 
 <p>However, Bud still read the other words written on the cliff.</p> 
 <p>“I will rule the world. Do not resent me.”</p> 
 <p>The first row.</p> 
 <p>&lt; Become strong. Then save the world. &gt;</p> 
 <p>The row underneath it.</p> 
 <p>&lt; I will rule the world. Do not resent me. &gt;</p> 
 <p>Bud could not tell who wrote the first row.<br> However, he felt as if he could tell who wrote the second row.</p> 
 <p>“…The White Star.”</p> 
 <p>He was certain that the White Star, the last Dragon Slayer, wrote those words.<br> He probably wrote it for the villagers right before he went to destroy Sheritt’s castle.</p> 
 <p>“This is…beautiful?”</p> 
 <p>Bud could hear Cale's disapproving voice.</p> 
 <p>“I can’t hear any birds nor insects. All I see are vegetation, a fake sun, and these suffocating cliffs.”</p> 
 <p>Bud made eye contact with Cale.<br> Cale casually commented with a stoic expression.</p> 
 <p>“The strongest people in the world must have been frustrated with having to live here.”</p> 
 <p>He started to walk as he added on.</p> 
 <p>“It must have felt like a prison.”</p> 
 <p>Prison.<br> Bud could not say anything about it.</p> 
 <p>“Cat got your tongue?”<br> “…Huh? No, I just-!”</p> 
 <p>Bud scratched his head as he looked at Cale walk past him.<br> However, Cale had not been talking to Bud.</p> 
 <p>He was speaking to the Scary Giant Cobblestone.</p> 
 <p>However, he did not hear a response.<br> The ancient powers had been quiet ever since he blocked the White Star's attacks.</p> 
 <p>However, Cale needed the Super Rock.<br> The first Dragon Slayer that the Super Rock had protected. He needed information about the first Dragon Slayer.</p> 
 <p>“Ahem. Cale, in response to your thoughts that this place could feel like a prison… I-”<br> “Shut up.”</p> 
 <p>Cale made Bud shut up.<br> Bud looked toward Cale with sorrow, but Cale just motioned to Raon.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go to the center.”</p> 
 <p>Cale looked up above the lush forest.</p> 
 <p>He could see a tall stone building standing between the trees.<br> It was surrounded by vines, but he could still tell that it was a building.</p> 
 <p>“That’s where the village should be located.”</p> 
 <p>Swoooooooosh-</p> 
 <p>The Sound of the Wind gathered around Cale's feet.<br> He kicked off the ground.<br> The others followed behind him.</p> 
 <p>Shhhhhhh-</p> 
 <p>Cale moved forward while pushing aside the leaves.<br> This place that nobody touched for a thousand years felt like a jungle.</p> 
 <p>“Cale-nim.”</p> 
 <p>Choi Han pointed in front of him.<br> On and Hong who were both jumping through the trees shouted as well.</p> 
 <p>“I think there's a village up there!”<br> “I can see buildings!”<br> “Human! It's over there!”</p> 
 <p>Cale was already looking at the place Raon was pointing at with both paws.</p> 
 <p>He could see a large open area.<br> It was the center of the forest.</p> 
 <p>He could see buildings made of stone or wood.<br> The buildings were so old that they were crumbling or covered in vegetation.<br> There were two large statues at the entrance of this village.</p> 
 <p>“They are swordsmen.”</p> 
 <p>The large statues were of swordsmen kneeling on one knee.</p> 
 <p>Clang!</p> 
 <p>Choi Han took out his sword.</p> 
 <p>Paat!</p> 
 <p>The eyes of the two statues flashed.</p> 
 <p>‘There are guardians I created at the village entrance. They are there to protect the village.’</p> 
 <p>Everybody recalled one of the things that Lord Sheritt had said.</p> 
 <p>Boooom-!<br> Boom!</p> 
 <p>The two statue guardians raised their bodies that were covered in vines after being abandoned for 1,000 years.</p> 
 <p>Crackle!<br> Crack!</p> 
 <p>The vines surrounding their bodies started to rip away.<br> The two statue swordsmen took out their large stone swords at the same time.<br> The points of those swords were pointing toward Cale's group.</p> 
 <p>However, Cale's group did not slow down. In fact, they started to speed up as they got closer to the village.</p> 
 <p>Boom! Boom!</p> 
 <p>The guardians started to move. They got into a position to defend the village.<br> These guardians were three times as tall as Choi Han.<br> They raised their swords high into the sky.</p> 
 <p>As their swords headed back down…</p> 
 <p>“I'll see you later.”</p> 
 <p>Cale charged forward.<br> Choi Han’s sword swung down vertically in response.</p> 
 <p>Slaaaaaash!</p> 
 <p>The vines blocking Cale's way were slashed away by Choi Han’s aura.<br> There was nothing in Cale’s way anymore.</p> 
 <p>Boooooooong!</p> 
 <p>A stone sword was slashing down toward Cale.<br> And then…</p> 
 <p>Boom!<br> Boom!</p> 
 <p>The stone swords fell to the ground.<br> The guardians started to move at the same time.</p> 
 <p>Boom! Boom!</p> 
 <p>The large guardians’ two knees created craters on the ground.<br> The swordsmen knelt down.<br> Their stone swords were stabbed into the ground.</p> 
 <p>Shaaaaaaaaaaa-</p> 
 <p>Between the two guardians.<br> Cale who was surrounded by wind easily landed on the ground.</p> 
 <p>Lord Sheritt had said the following.</p> 
 <p>‘Once the guardians appear.’</p> 
 <p>The white crown was on Cale's head as he descended to the ground.</p> 
 <p>‘Cale Henituse, become a king.’</p> 
 <p>The two guardians lowered their heads toward Cale.</p> 
 <p>‘That village is a place for Dragon Slayers. All things there will welcome the return of the king.’</p> 
 <p>Cale looked past the kneeling statues.</p> 
 <p>The stone building that he could see from the distance was now fully visible in front of him.</p> 
 <p>‘There is a stone building at the center of the village.’</p> 
 <p>Cale started to walk toward the stone building.</p> 
 <p>‘There is a barrier surrounding that building. The first Dragon Slayer and I created it together.’</p> 
 <p>There was a half-transparent barrier surrounding the stone building that was covered in vines.</p> 
 <p>‘Plants and water can freely approach that building, but humans and animals cannot get past the barrier.’</p> 
 <p>Cale walked straight forward.<br> Nothing was getting in his way.</p> 
 <p>He took a step toward the barrier.</p> 
 <p>Ooooooong-</p> 
 <p>The white crown on his head started to shake.</p> 
 <p>Paat!</p> 
 <p>The barrier surrounding the stone building disappeared at the same time.<br> He looked back to make sure the others were following him before entering the stone building that nobody had entered for 1,000 years.</p> 
 <p>‘That stone building was the first Dragon Slayer’s home.’</p> 
 <p>It was a building that only the person with the Dragon Slayer's crown could enter generation after generation.</p> 
 <p>“…How interesting.”</p> 
 <p>The others looked toward his back after hearing him mumble.<br> However, Cale did not look back at them as he walked past the old stairs and headed toward the center of the building.</p> 
 <p>There was an altar at the center of the empty first floor hall.<br> Cale walked toward the altar as he started to speak again.</p> 
 <p>“The traces of people have not disappeared even after a thousand years.”</p> 
 <p>Bud's expression stiffened up after hearing that.</p> 
 <p>They had not seen any skeletons since coming down from the cave. It could be said that they all returned to dust after such a long time, however, there were traces of clothing.</p> 
 <p>There were traces of children’s toys in the plaza as well.<br> There were no people, but their traces had remained.<br> Traces that showed that they must have been full of life.</p> 
 <p>It was as if people who were living peacefully had suddenly met their ends and all that remained for a thousand years were their belongings and traces of them.<br> Bud started to think that what he described might have actually been how it happened.</p> 
 <p>He quickly snapped out of it and followed Cale to the altar.</p> 
 <p>Lord Sheritt had told them about it.<br> She had said there would be a record book that the first Dragon Slayer created.<br> She had said that everything would be written inside it.</p> 
 <p>‘Look through the record book on top of the altar.’</p> 
 <p>She said that they would be able to find the White Star’s weakness in the book.</p> 
 <p>‘That book is something only someone who can put the crown on their head can grab.’</p> 
 <p>Bud looked toward the crown on top of Cale’s head.<br> Cale was the only one here who could grab the record book.</p> 
 <p>Bud could see a very thick book once he approached the altar.<br> The book that was covered in a thick barrier looked fine even though 10,000 years had passed since the first Dragon Slayer.</p> 
 <p>It was soon time for this book to end up in Cale's hands.<br> Bud could feel his heart beating wildly.<br> It was from excitement.</p> 
 <p>“…Cale-nim?”<br> “Human?”</p> 
 <p>However, Bud's expression stiffened after hearing the group calling for Cale.</p> 
 <p>“…Hey, what’s wrong?”</p> 
 <p>Cale was standing in front of the altar with an odd expression.<br> Bud had never seen such an expression on Cale before.</p> 
 <p>Cale’s face was completely pale.</p> 
 <p>Cale clenched his fists.<br> The tips of his fingers were shaking. He brushed his face with his shaking fingers.</p> 
 <p>He could see the book on top of the altar.<br> This record book had survived for 10,000 years underneath this barrier.</p> 
 <p>He could see the title and author written on it.</p> 
 <p>‘The Birth of a Hero.<br> Nelan Barrow.’</p> 
 <p>It had the same title and author as the book that Kim Rok Soo had laughed at and read until volume 5.</p>
