 <p>The moment Cale thought that this testing ground might be a real world…</p> 
 <p>He started to think.</p> 
 <p>‘If this is a different world and I need to leave this place to return home…’</p> 
 <p>Then there was only one answer.</p> 
 <p>‘Let's teach them.’</p> 
 <p>Teach the people here how to do it.</p> 
 <p>Originally, the twenty years old Kim Rok Soo was pretty useless.</p> 
 <p>However, as he passed 25, 30, and then 35, Kim Rok Soo became a decent person.</p> 
 <p>He had grown.</p> 
 <p>If even he had grown, what if these people who were supposed to die here ended up surviving and growing?</p> 
 <p>‘They’ll all be better than me.’</p> 
 <p>Just thinking about it was making him laugh.</p> 
 <p>That was what Cale wanted.</p> 
 <p>For that reason, he had started this first lesson.</p> 
 <p>"Screeeech- screeeeeeech!”</p> 
 <p>Cale moved even faster toward the 3-meter tall mummy-like skeleton monster charging toward him.</p> 
 <p>Jang Man Soo had barely managed to crawl over to the ledge and peeked out while holding onto the railing.</p> 
 <p>He could see the wind surrounding Cale and the reddish-gold light in his hands.</p> 
 <p>But Jang Man Soo started to shout.</p> 
 <p>“Rok Soo! Dodge!”</p> 
 <p>He could see a black animal charging toward Cale.</p> 
 <p>The black snake wolf.</p> 
 <p>Jang Man Soo had seen people being eaten by this black wolf that was covered in snakeskin.</p> 
 <p>He had also heard that people who said goodbye to him as they went hunting were squashed by that bastard’s front paw.</p> 
 <p>That bastard was a source of fear and hell.</p> 
 <p>Kim Rok Soo looked too weak and tiny compared to this house-sized snake wolf.</p> 
 <p>“Roooooar!”</p> 
 <p>The black snake wolf charged at him from the right with its jaw open.</p> 
 <p>Jang Man Soo’s eyes opened and his hands that were holding the railing started to shake.</p> 
 <p>‘No.’</p> 
 <p>Kim Rok Soo could not die.</p> 
 <p>“Rok Soo--!”</p> 
 <p>Baaaaang!</p> 
 <p>Jang Man Soo shouted as he heard a loud explosion.</p> 
 <p>A lot of dust shot up.</p> 
 <p>However, the dust soon subsided.</p> 
 <p>Jang Man Soo subconsciously opened his mouth.</p> 
 <p>“…A shield?”</p> 
 <p>A silver shield with two wings open was blocking the black wolf.</p> 
 <p>“…Holy crap. How many powers does this son of a bitch have?”</p> 
 <p>He heard Park Jin Tae mumbling, but Jang Man Soo could not say anything.</p> 
 <p>The shield was small compared to his shield.</p> 
 <p>It was only big enough to block the black wolf's face and front paw.</p> 
 <p>But the way it was being used was different.</p> 
 <p>At least, that’s how Jang Man Soo felt.</p> 
 <p>Kim Rok Soo was not using the shield to block the enemy, but so that he could keep moving forward.</p> 
 <p>Jang Man Soo made eye contact with Cale who was on the other side of the shield.</p> 
 <p>He might be wrong, but it seemed as if Rok Soo was looking at him.</p> 
 <p>It was as if he was teaching him that this was how to use a shield even though he was in the middle of a battle.</p> 
 <p>It was as if he was showing how to do it.</p> 
 <p>“…Did I make a mistake?”<br> “Of course not!”</p> 
 <p>Jang Man Soo looked toward Park Jin Tae. But Park Jin Tae was not looking at him. He was speaking.</p> 
 <p>“He’s obviously using the shield like that for you to see, Mr. Jang Man Soo! Isn’t that obvious?”</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae stopped talking for a moment.</p> 
 <p>He still couldn’t take his eyes off the rose-gold light in Cale’s hands.</p> 
 <p>“Crazy bastard.”</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae realized that the pressure flowing out of Cale had disappeared at some point.</p> 
 <p>However, his hand was still full of sweat.</p> 
 <p>“Screeeech!”</p> 
 <p>Cale, who had been looking at Jang Man Soo, started to walk again.</p> 
 <p>Craaaaaaack-</p> 
 <p>His shield slowly started to crack.</p> 
 <p>This Indestructible Shield was not even at half power after all.</p> 
 <p>“…And I can’t overdo it.”</p> 
 <p>Cale wasn't using all of his powers.</p> 
 <p>Efficiency was the most important thing right now.</p> 
 <p>Swoooooooosh-</p> 
 <p>Cale rode the wind and shot forward before the shield broke.</p> 
 <p>“Roooooooooooooooar!”</p> 
 <p>The wolf’s roar echoed in Cale's ear.</p> 
 <p>Someone landed on the roof at that moment.</p> 
 <p>“Huff, huff! I’m here!”</p> 
 <p>It was Bae Puh Rum.</p> 
 <p>Kim Min Ah walked over to Bae Puh Rum. To be more specific, she had walked over to her brother who was on his back.</p> 
 <p>"Oppa!”<br> “Mr. Kim Min Joon.”</p> 
 <p>Choi Han also walked over to Kim Min Joon and made eye contact with him.</p> 
 <p>Kim Min Ah flinched for a moment before stepping back. It was because she saw Grandma Kim standing behind Choi Han.</p> 
 <p>“I will get started.”</p> 
 <p>Grandma Kim immediately put her hand on Kim Min Joon's infected wound.</p> 
 <p>A bright light surrounded his wound.</p> 
 <p>They heard a sharp voice at that moment.</p> 
 <p>“Screeeeeech!”</p> 
 <p>The skeleton covered in bandages swung its arms at Cale.</p> 
 <p>Swoooooooosh-</p> 
 <p>The bandages on both of its arms instantly turned into sharp whips that struck down to split Cale in half.</p> 
 <p>The movement was elaborate.</p> 
 <p>However, there were no openings. Actually, even if there were any openings, they would only last a few short seconds. It swung its bandage whips around before striking down at Cale.</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae bit down on his lips.</p> 
 <p>“…Those damn bandages-”</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae who had escaped from that monster in the past to survive started to frown.</p> 
 <p>He heard Choi Han’s voice at that moment.</p> 
 <p>“Three steps to the left.”<br> “…What the hell are-”</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae's eyes opened wide.</p> 
 <p>Cale quickly took three steps to the left.</p> 
 <p>“The blind spot of the two arm bandage attack.”</p> 
 <p>Everybody looked toward Choi Han at that moment.</p> 
 <p>“Please look at Rok Soo hyung. I'm just repeating what he told me.”</p> 
 <p>They heard Lee Chul Min’s voice at that moment.</p> 
 <p>“My goodness! It really is a blind spot!”</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae’s eyes opened wide as he quickly looked back at Cale.</p> 
 <p>‘It’s as Choi Han, no, as Kim Rok Soo said!’</p> 
 <p>Three steps to the left.</p> 
 <p>An area where the bandage whips could not reach was there.</p> 
 <p>“Five steps forward.”</p> 
 <p>Cale then quickly took five steps forward. He mumbled the things he had told Choi Han.</p> 
 <p>Choi Han continued to speak as well.</p> 
 <p>"The bandage monster will raise its left arm.”<br> "The bandage monster will raise its left arm.”</p> 
 <p>It was a pattern.</p> 
 <p>It was a monster’s unchanging pattern that all monsters Grade 1 and lower had.</p> 
 <p>Cale could see the bandage monster raise its left arm.</p> 
 <p>“The first weakness. The left armpit.”</p> 
 <p>Cale could see a red rock in the spot of the bandage monster’s armpit when it raised its arm.</p> 
 <p>“Aim.”</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae was hearing Choi Han's voice, but it felt as if Kim Rok Soo was talking to him.</p> 
 <p>That was not it.</p> 
 <p>It was actually Kim Rok Soo.</p> 
 <p>Choi Han was sharking Kim Rok Soo’s will.</p> 
 <p>Choi Han continued to speak.</p> 
 <p>“Fire.”</p> 
 <p>The moment Park Jin Tae saw the bandage monster raise its arm… He saw a rose gold light shooting toward its left armpit.</p> 
 <p>It looked like a gun.</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae subconsciously took his gun out of his pocket.</p> 
 <p>“First weakness destroyed.”<br> “Screeeech-!”</p> 
 <p>He heard the monster’s scream and Choi Han's voice at the same time.</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae’s eyes were still focused on Cale.</p> 
 <p>“Screeech, kiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!”</p> 
 <p>The screeching monster looked toward Cale.</p> 
 <p>Sharp thorns shot out from on top of the bones that had been covered by the bandages and headed for Cale.</p> 
 <p>However, Cale was not there.</p> 
 <p>“Move through the legs.”</p> 
 <p>Cale’s body was already passing through the monster’s skeleton legs.</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae got the chills seeing him move so boldly.</p> 
 <p>Who would ever think about moving through a Grade 1 monster’s legs?</p> 
 <p>Especially a monster that swung bandage whips all around itself!</p> 
 <p>‘But Kim Rok Soo managed to do it.’</p> 
 <p>He passed through the legs as if he was lying down and sliding through before raising his arms.</p> 
 <p>“The second weakness.”</p> 
 <p>He would quickly take care of this monster.</p> 
 <p>“Inside the right thigh.”</p> 
 <p>Crack, crackle!</p> 
 <p>The Fire of Destruction, two strands of its fiery thunderbolt struck the leg bone by its thigh.</p> 
 <p>“Explode!”</p> 
 <p>Baaaaaang!</p> 
 <p>The fiery thunderbolts exploded. The skeleton monster’s screaming shook the area.</p> 
 <p>“Screeeeeeeeeeeeech---!”</p> 
 <p>Its eyes inside the skull turned red.</p> 
 <p>“Approaching berserk state.”</p> 
 <p>This was a unique trait of the skeleton monster.</p> 
 <p>It would immediately enter berserk state once the second weakness was attacked and become twice as strong.</p> 
 <p>That was why this bastard was scary.</p> 
 <p>‘If you don’t know about it that is.’</p> 
 <p>But if you knew about it?</p> 
 <p>‘It’s very easy.’</p> 
 <p>The skeleton monster turned around.</p> 
 <p>Cale started to laugh.</p> 
 <p>He could see Park Jin Tae standing on the roof and looking at him with a focused gaze.</p> 
 <p>“Good, he’s paying attention.”</p> 
 <p>Cale quickly moved to the right.</p> 
 <p>Choi Han continued to speak.</p> 
 <p>“The black snake wolf’s second attack.”</p> 
 <p>The black wolf to the right jumped over the skeleton and charged for Cale.</p> 
 <p>“Aim for the ankle.”</p> 
 <p>Fire.</p> 
 <p>The fourth fiery thunderbolt pierced through the black wolf’s right ankle.</p> 
 <p>Its skin was like a snake.</p> 
 <p>However, its weakness was fire.</p> 
 <p>“Roooooooooar!”</p> 
 <p>The wolf roared as its body leaned to one side.</p> 
 <p>Choi Han continued to speak.</p> 
 <p>“Jump.”</p> 
 <p>Cale kicked off the ground. He stepped on the wolf’s head and his body shot up.</p> 
 <p>Then he was able to make eye contact with the bandage monster.</p> 
 <p>“Screeeech-!!”</p> 
 <p>He made eye contact with the skeleton monster that was swinging its bandages and thorny bones while looking at him.</p> 
 <p>The moment he looked into those eyes…</p> 
 <p>“Fire the last bullets.”</p> 
 <p>Choi Han made a comment. The word ‘bullet’ etched itself in Park Jin Tae’s mind.</p> 
 <p>The rose gold thunderbolts struck the skeleton's two eyes.</p> 
 <p>Baaaaaang!</p> 
 <p>They were not strong enough to destroy the skeleton's head.</p> 
 <p>They were only strong enough to cause explosions where the monster’s eyes should be.</p> 
 <p>Cale used the explosion to move and his body rolled on the ground.</p> 
 <p>The skeleton monster’s last weakness was its eyes that had turned red.</p> 
 <p>It was a critical weakness that only appeared once it went berserk.</p> 
 <p>The skeleton monster’s body started to tilt without even being able to scream.</p> 
 <p>“Roooooooooooooooar!”</p> 
 <p>The skeleton monster’s body was starting to fall on the black wolf.</p> 
 <p>The black wolf that had one ankle ripped off was doing its best to dodge the skeleton's body.</p> 
 <p>It was because there was fire coming out of where the skeleton's red eyes had exploded.</p> 
 <p>The black snake wolf that had snake skin could not let that fire touch its body.</p> 
 <p>However, Choi Han's voice reached Jang Man Soo's ears at that moment.</p> 
 <p>“Use the shield.”</p> 
 <p>A silver shield blocked the black snake wolf's path.</p> 
 <p>The snake wolf could not move forward. And on top of it…</p> 
 <p>“Roooooooooooooooar!”</p> 
 <p>A burning skeleton head, its sharp thorny bones, and bandages that would easily catch fire fell on the snake wolf.</p> 
 <p>Baaaaaaaaaang-!</p> 
 <p>Fire shot up.</p> 
 <p>The people on the roof heard Choi Han’s voice.</p> 
 <p>“I only managed to memorize the first battle. Rok Soo hyung will tell you about the rest.”</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae, Jang Man Soo, Kim Min Ah, and the others all looked away from the burning monsters and at Cale who was heading back to the building.</p> 
 <p>‘C, crazy bastard!’</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae’s voice was shaking.</p> 
 <p>He couldn't even think straight long enough to try to hide it.</p> 
 <p>How long had it been?</p> 
 <p>How long had it taken him to take down those two monsters?</p> 
 <p>It didn't seem to take very long.</p> 
 <p>“Damn it.”</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae’s hands were shaking.</p> 
 <p>‘I feel like I could do it.’</p> 
 <p>Damn it!</p> 
 <p>He felt as if he could take down the bandage monster. He felt as if he could take down the black snake wolf as well.</p> 
 <p>‘As long as I'm with Jang Man Soo that is.’</p> 
 <p>He turned toward Jang Man Soo.</p> 
 <p>Jang Man Soo's hands were shaking as well. Jang Man Soo started to speak.</p> 
 <p>“Umm, umm, hey, Jin Tae. Don’t you think we could take care of the bandage monster and snake wolf when the Grade 1 monsters come to attack?”</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae chuckled while looking at Jang Man Soo who was speaking while looking at him with an awkward expression. That was all he could do.</p> 
 <p>He felt as if he could take down these monster bastards that he had run away from all this time as Jang Man Soo said.</p> 
 <p>‘Of course, we don't have the experience.’</p> 
 <p>It was not easy to move around while attacking the monsters following the pattern with proper timing as Kim Rok Soo had done.</p> 
 <p>It would only be possible if they trained over and over to make that pattern feel normal.</p> 
 <p>‘But Kim Rok Soo did it.’</p> 
 <p>Was it possible?</p> 
 <p>Could a person move like that because they had foresight and used data?</p> 
 <p>‘…He couldn’t do it without a ton of experience.’</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae could not believe it.</p> 
 <p>He quietly looked at the approaching Kim Rok Soo.</p> 
 <p>However, Cale, who had memorized these patterns as if they were his own instincts and had tons of experience that Park Jin Tae did not know about, let out a small sigh.</p> 
 <p>‘My body is weak.’</p> 
 <p>His body felt slow compared to when he had been team leader Kim Rok Soo. He was weak.</p> 
 <p>He didn't have enough muscles.</p> 
 <p>Even the ancient powers that weren’t even at half strength were difficult for this body to handle.</p> 
 <p>‘But I was still able to fight pretty easily.’</p> 
 <p>Drip.</p> 
 <p>Cale wiped away the small amount of blood at the corner of his lip and looked up at the roof.</p> 
 <p>A corner of Park Jin Tae’s lips was up as he looked down at Cale with an odd expression. Cale chuckled at Park Jin Tae and started to speak.</p> 
 <p>“Kim Min Ah, Bae Puh Rum.”</p> 
 <p>He sounded extremely calm, as if he had just come back from a walk.</p> 
 <p>Kim Min Ah and Bae Puh Rum looked at Cale.</p> 
 <p>They weren't the only ones.</p> 
 <p>Everybody inside the building was looking at Cale through the windows or on the roof.</p> 
 <p>Boom!</p> 
 <p>They heard two more monsters approaching, but they were still focused on Cale.</p> 
 <p>Cale quietly took in their gazes and started to speak as if that was easy to do.</p> 
 <p>“Come down. I'll teach you guys something this time.”</p>
