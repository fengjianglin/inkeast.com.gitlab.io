 <p>Choi Han started to walk toward Adin. </p> 
 <p>“How could someone move so quickly?!” </p> 
 <p>One of the knights could not hide his shock. </p> 
 <p>He could just see a black blur. <br> A human and his sword that were both covered in black aura was charging toward Imperial Prince Adin as if he was a wild animal. <br> The black aura continued to run wild as Choi Han moved. </p> 
 <p>‘His highness is a high-grade knight!’ </p> 
 <p>The knight felt fear as he watched Choi Han almost instantly arrive in front of Adin with his sword raised. His superior calmed him down at that moment. </p> 
 <p>“It will be fine.” <br> “…Excuse me?” </p> 
 <p>The two swords clashed as the knight asked back. </p> 
 <p>Baaaaaang! </p> 
 <p>A loud noise filled the area as if a mountain had crashed into another mountain. </p> 
 <p>“Ugh! Cover your eyes!” </p> 
 <p>The knight quickly covered his eyes at his superior’s urging. <br> The dust underground, the broken pieces of the ground, started to fly up from the impact. <br> And once the dust settled down… </p> 
 <p>“…My goodness, something like that is possible?” </p> 
 <p>The knight even forgot that he was in the middle of a battle after seeing what was going on. </p> 
 <p>The black things were fighting to gobble each other up. </p> 
 <p>Choi Han looked at the black sword that was up against his sword. </p> 
 <p>It was a sword made of dead mana. Furthermore, it was surrounded by black aura smoke. </p> 
 <p>His sword that was surrounded by the aura of a sword master was unable to break this black sword. </p> 
 <p>Imperial Prince Adin started to laugh at this sight. </p> 
 <p>“What do you think? You already knew this. My black aura smoke and your black aura are at completely different levels.” </p> 
 <p>Screeeeech- <br> The two swords were up against each other while maintaining a balance. <br> Adin started to smile more and more as that continued. It could not be helped. </p> 
 <p>It was because of their clash earlier and their second clash now. <br> Choi Han showed no emotion on his face. </p> 
 <p>However, unlike the first time, he was not hiding his aura and letting it run wild. <br> However, Adin could see it. He opened his mouth to speak. </p> 
 <p>“Don't you want to eat it up?” </p> 
 <p>Choi Han’s dull eyes headed toward Adin. <br> Adin's gaze headed toward Choi Han’s hands. </p> 
 <p>The hands were slightly shaking. </p> 
 <p>The Imperial Prince whispered like a snake. </p> 
 <p>“My black despair. Don't you want to eat it? Hmm?” </p> 
 <p>Adin could see Choi Han’s gaze going blank. Choi Han’s sword changed direction at that moment. </p> 
 <p>Bang! <br> The two swords clashed again. </p> 
 <p>Choi Han’s sword then headed for Adin’s remaining left leg. </p> 
 <p>Baaaaang! <br> However, the Imperial Prince's right leg slammed into Choi Han’s sword before it could reach the left leg. </p> 
 <p>It was the black leg made of dead mana. </p> 
 <p>“Ka, kahaha!” </p> 
 <p>Adin started to laugh. </p> 
 <p>“See! Your sword can’t even cut my right leg now!” </p> 
 <p>Crack. <br> The ground started to break as the monster-like leg slammed into the ground with some force. Choi Han and Adin started to clash again at the same time. </p> 
 <p>Baaaaang! <br> Bang! Bang! </p> 
 <p>Black light appeared every time they clashed. Adin was smiling brightly as he raised his black aura smoke up. </p> 
 <p>"Are you really not going to eat it?” </p> 
 <p>He then sent that smoke toward Choi Han. </p> 
 <p>Slaaash! <br> Choi Han’s sword cut through that black smoke. However, the black smoke did not disappear but instead continued to approach Choi Han. </p> 
 <p>Bang! <br> Choi Han moved away from the smoke and swung his sword toward Adin only for it to be blocked again. <br> Adin looked at Choi Han’s shaking hands and commented. </p> 
 <p>“You can’t use your full abilities because your hands are shaking.” </p> 
 <p>How could someone swing a sword properly while their hands were shaking? </p> 
 <p>Adin pulled out even more black despair from his wildly beating heart. An odd noise filled the underground hall at that moment. </p> 
 <p>Screeeech- screeeeeeech- </p> 
 <p>The black despair. The shrieks of the dead souls within it. <br> The shrieks filled Choi Han’s ears. </p> 
 <p>“Ugh!” </p> 
 <p>His emotionless face turned into a frown for the first time. </p> 
 <p>Boom! Boom! Boom! <br> Choi Han’s heart was running wild. </p> 
 <p>It was telling him to eat it. </p> 
 <p>It was telling him to make the black despair his. It was telling him to become complete. <br> Choi Han could feel this silent seduction fill his entire body as if it was being pricked by needles. </p> 
 <p>“Uhh, ugh!” </p> 
 <p>It was even worse than the time with the golem. <br> Unlike the black despair that was inside the golem, the black despair that Adin was sending out was going into his body in the form of smoke. </p> 
 <p>Screech- screech- </p> 
 <p>Choi Han had no choice but to take two steps back. <br> He heard Adin's voice in his ear at that moment. </p> 
 <p>“You see, this thing called despair…” </p> 
 <p>Adin looked into Choi Han’s eyes that were getting duller every time he brought out more black despair and continued to speak. </p> 
 <p>This thing called despair. </p> 
 <p>“…It is infectious. It makes sense if you think about it. Who in the world wants to be the only one in despair?” </p> 
 <p>Choi Han could hear Adin's voice along with his heart that was beating even more wildly now. </p> 
 <p>‘He is right.’ </p> 
 <p>His heart was roaring at him that Adin was right. </p> 
 <p>It was asking him to remember what he had shouted as he was running away from enemies in the Forest of Darkness alone. </p> 
 <p>‘Why am I the only one facing such a situation? This is so unfair.’</p> 
 <p>It was bringing up his past saying these were the things he had said. </p> 
 <p>“That is why it is greedy for other people's despair.” </p> 
 <p>‘He's right.’ </p> 
 <p>His heart was agreeing with Adin again. <br> It was saying that was why his entire body was desiring the despair of others. </p> 
 <p>Adin's voice and his heart mixed together to sound like one voice in Choi Han’s ears. </p> 
 <p>“You will grow stronger only by taking in this black despair.” </p> 
 <p>‘Yes. Take it in. <br> Become stronger. <br> It’ll be just like how you became stronger in the Forest of Darkness. <br> Then everything will be fine.’ </p> 
 <p>“The other option would have been to be born in a position like me where anything can easily be attained…what are you doing?” </p> 
 <p>Adin's gaze headed toward Choi Han. </p> 
 <p>“Pfft!” </p> 
 <p>Choi Han’s shoulders were moving up and down before they pulled back to reveal his face. </p> 
 <p>“Pwa, hahahaha!” </p> 
 <p>Choi Han was laughing. </p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Human, I’ve never seen Choi Han laugh like this before! </li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>Even Cale, who was looking at the battlefield, was so shocked that he nodded his head at Raon's comment. </p> 
 <p>“Me neither.” </p> 
 <p>‘I've never seen that punk laugh like this.’ </p> 
 <p>Cale started to frown but Choi Han’s laugh continued for a while. </p> 
 <p>“Hahahaha- haha! Ugh, hahaha!” </p> 
 <p>Choi Han almost couldn’t breathe properly because he was laughing too hard. <br> Adin's expression turned odd once Choi Han stopped laughing. </p> 
 <p>It wasn’t there. <br> The black aura had disappeared. </p> 
 <p>Choi Han had pulled back all of his black aura. Choi Han’s next actions shocked Adin. <br> He was charging toward Adin once again. </p> 
 <p>He was charging without any aura. </p> 
 <p>Choi Han was only using his body and his sword as he charged toward Adin. </p> 
 <p>“Are you crazy?” </p> 
 <p>Choi Han could hear Adin's question. <br> He could also hear his heart. </p> 
 <p>‘You need to take in the black despair and become stronger.’ </p> 
 <p>Choi Han started to speak at that moment. </p> 
 <p>“Throw it away.” <br> “…What?” </p> 
 <p>Adin’s question did not reach Choi Han’s ears. </p> 
 <p>Boom! Boom! Boom! <br> He did not hear his heart either. He just focused his hearing on his heart that was beating wildly. It was proof that there was blood flowing through his body. </p> 
 <p>It was proof that he was alive. </p> 
 <p>He remembered when he first fell into the Forest of Darkness. <br> Choi Han had thrown a lot of things away in order to survive. </p> 
 <p>He had gobbled down fruit and meat that monsters had thrown away on the ground. <br> He hid between monster corpses to hide himself and could not do anything when bugs would crawl on his body. <br> He had even covered himself in monster shit before curling up and hiding in a hole so that the monsters would not smell him. </p> 
 <p>Pride. Cleanliness. Warm food. A place to peacefully lay down. <br> He had thrown all of them away one by one. </p> 
 <p>There was something that filled those empty voids. </p> 
 <p>He didn't remember what day it started. <br> He didn’t remember when it started. <br> The thing coming out of his sword was black. </p> 
 <p>However, there was just one thing that he did not throw away. <br> During the night when he covered his body with the shit of predators in order to avoid other predators. <br> During the night when it would be bad if he fell asleep. <br> He always quietly mumbled to himself during the night. </p> 
 <p>‘…I am-!’ </p> 
 <p>It was not just during the night. <br> He mumbled this to himself whenever he had a chance. </p> 
 <p>‘I am- Choi Han.’ </p> 
 <p>‘I am Choi Han.’ </p> 
 <p>‘Choi Han.’ </p> 
 <p>He repeated his name over and over. <br> He repeated his name thousands and thousands of times. He repeated his name over and over with every chance he had. </p> 
 <p>There were no humans in the Forest of Darkness. <br> He was trying to prevent himself from forgetting about language while in a space where he didn’t need to speak. <br> He was trying to not forget who he was. </p> 
 <p>The only thing that he did not throw away was his name. <br> It was because that was, ‘him.’ <br> He could not throw himself away even if he threw everything else away. </p> 
 <p>He had never thrown his name away in the tens, no maybe even longer amount of years he had to survive. <br> If he could exist as Choi Han… <br> He could throw anything else away and fill it with something else. </p> 
 <p>Choi Han’s sword was now in front of Adin's face. It was a regular sword without aura. <br> Adin started to speak as soon as he saw Choi Han’s focused eyes. </p> 
 <p>“Throw away the things you don't need.” </p> 
 <p>The shaking had stopped. <br> Choi Han’s hands were no longer shaking. </p> 
 <p>He thought about the things he needed to refill. <br> He thought about his life since leaving the Forest of Darkness. <br> It was extremely short compared to his time in the Forest of Darkness. </p> 
 <p>However, those memories didn't make his hands start to shake. </p> 
 <p>He remembered something Raon and Cale had said during his time in the Henituse Estate. </p> 
 <p>‘Choi Han! I've been thinking about this for a while, but the pronunciation of your name is unique!’ <br> ‘I like it.’ <br> ‘Of course, I like your name as the human mentioned! But my name is the best!’ </p> 
 <p>Choi Han kicked off the ground. <br> He watched as Adin kicked off the ground after him and slowly slashed down with his sword. </p> 
 <p>Raon and Cale had chatted with each other while looking at him. </p> 
 <p>‘Well, his name is unique, so it is easy to remember. Also…’ </p> 
 <p>Cale had chuckled before making the next comment. </p> 
 <p>‘…And Choi Han, I can’t think of a different name for you.’ <br> ‘You're right! Choi Han is the best name for Choi Han!’ </p> 
 <p>Choi Han started to smile. <br> He casually commented to Adin, who was raising up his black despair to the maximum level as he kicked off behind him. </p> 
 <p>“So stupid.” </p> 
 <p>Adin was stupid. </p> 
 <p>A sword master was not just someone who could create aura.</p> 
 <p>It was someone who had put their whole life into the sword by swinging it thousands and thousands of times. </p> 
 <p>Dark Destruction Sword Art. <br> That was the name of his sword art. </p> 
 <p>His life was dark at that time and he had nothing. <br> That was why he had chosen the name Dark Destruction. He had destroyed everything in his dark life other than his name. </p> 
 <p>But it was now time to throw that name away. <br> Why? </p> 
 <p>It was still black, but now it was full. <br> There were too many things in his life now. </p> 
 <p>Boom! Boom! Boom! <br> Choi Han started to smile brightly. </p> 
 <p>The voice of his heart disappeared. Choi Han clasped his hand around his sword tighter. All of the blood inside his body was boiling. </p> 
 <p>‘I will grow stronger and survive in the end.’ </p> 
 <p>Smoke started to appear from his sword as he swung down. <br> Changes started to appear in Choi Han’s sword. </p> 
 <p>It was rising up. </p> 
 <p>Black aura was rising up from Choi Han’s sword. <br> However, it was different than before. </p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>H, human! L, look at that! T, that! </li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>‘I can see it too.’ </p> 
 <p>Cale’s eyes opened wide. <br> It was shining. <br> The aura was still black, but it was shining beautifully. </p> 
 <p>It was still a rough and violent black aura, however, it was glowing. <br> It was different than the dead mana and the black despair. </p> 
 <p>It was a different color than anybody else, including the black mages, necromancers, Dark Elves, and even Adin. </p> 
 <p>“T, this-” </p> 
 <p>Adin’s eyes opened wide. He could see this bright black light that was enveloping his sword that was made of dead mana and black smoke. <br> Choi Han was laughing as if he was crying. </p> 
 <p>He had not thrown away all of the despair. <br> He had only thrown half of the despair away and filled it with happiness. <br> He combined his past and his present. </p> 
 <p>“This is me.” </p> 
 <p>The bright black light left the tip of Choi Han’s sword and covered Adin. </p> 
 <p>“T, this is not possible!” </p> 
 <p>Adin could see his black smoke breaking down by the black light. </p> 
 <p>‘He changed his attribute?’ </p> 
 <p>Screeeeeech- screeeeeeech- <br> The terrible shrieks slowly disappeared. </p> 
 <p>Choi Han's new aura was not trying to gobble up the black despair. It just pierced right through it. <br> It cut through things in front of it like a sharp sword. </p> 
 <p>‘This is possible? <br> A bastard whose attribute was a lower class compared to mine now has a different attribute?’ </p> 
 <p>Adin started to frown. </p> 
 <p>The advantage of having a higher class attribute had disappeared. <br> That meant that the only thing left were the skills that they had developed on their own. <br> The aura smoke of a highest-grade expert was not able to defeat a sword master’s aura. </p> 
 <p>“N, no-!” </p> 
 <p>Adin could not help but shout as the beautiful black light destroyed his dead mana sword and rushed toward him. <br> It was at that moment. </p> 
 <p>Baaaaaaaaaang! </p> 
 <p>The beautiful black light and the explosion took away everyone's sight and hearing. <br> And once the flashing of the light disappeared… </p> 
 <p>Boom! <br> Adin fell once again. </p> 
 <p>“Cough, cough!” </p> 
 <p>Adin's hands and arms were a mess as he continued to cough. The dead mana sword had long disappeared. </p> 
 <p>“This, makes, no, s, sen, cough!” </p> 
 <p>A black shadow appeared behind Adin. <br> It was Choi Han. <br> He put his sword back in his scabbard and held it like a club. He then lifted one foot up. </p> 
 <p>“Uuuuugh, ugh!” </p> 
 <p>Choi Han used that foot to step on Adin’s chest as Adin coughed up black blood. </p> 
 <p>“Cough! Ugh, ugh!” </p> 
 <p>Choi Han turned his head as Adin started to cough up more blood because of the pressure on his chest. <br> He could see Cale giving him a thumbs up. <br> Cale was smiling while mouthing something. </p> 
 <p>‘Beat him up a bit.’ </p> 
 <p>Choi Han could hear Raon's voice as well. </p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Choi Han! Amazing! I like your new attribute! It is just like you! </li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>Choi Han raised his scabbard up. <br> Then he lowered it. </p> 
 <p>Pow! </p> 
 <p>He repeated the process. </p> 
 <p>Pow! </p> 
 <p>The beat down had started. </p> 
 <p>Choi Han thought about his new attribute. <br> It was not darkness. <br> It was not despair. </p> 
 <p>It did not fit into any category. There was no word to describe this attribute. </p> 
 <p>It was just Choi Han. It was an attribute that was like him. <br> He liked that. <br> It made him happy. </p> 
 <p>“Ha, haha-” </p> 
 <p>Choi Han could not help but laugh as he felt as if he had found himself. His child-like yet adult-like smile filled his face. </p> 
 <p>Pow, pow, pow! </p> 
 <p>He was still following Cale’s order and beating Adin up as he did that. <br> That was why Choi Han did not manage to see Cale's frowning face while watching him laugh as he beat someone up.</p>
