 <p>“…Thank you very much.”</p> 
 <p>Lee Soo Hyuk continued to quietly mumble while patting Cale's back.</p> 
 <p>Cale listened to his voice as he looked toward the castle wall past Lee Soo Hyuk’s shoulder.</p> 
 <p>‘They’re all shocked.’</p> 
 <p>They were all looking at Lee Soo Hyuk with shocked expressions.</p> 
 <p>‘I guess this side of him is foreign to them based on how the team leader usually acts.’</p> 
 <p>Seeing Lee Soo Hyuk being emotional like this was probably foreign to Grandma Kim and the Lee siblings behind Cale as well.</p> 
 <p>The Kim Rok Soo at this time would have found this to be extremely foreign and awkward.</p> 
 <p>But the current Cale knew why Lee Soo Hyuk was acting like this.</p> 
 <p>‘He's acting like this because he's tired.’</p> 
 <p>How long would he have to fight to get past each and every difficult and tiring day?</p> 
 <p>The bases keep falling no matter how many people he saves; does that mean he should just give it all up and live a relaxed life?</p> 
 <p>Lee Soo Hyuk's mind was full of those kinds of questions right now.</p> 
 <p>But he did not stop.</p> 
 <p>Lee Soo Hyuk continued to fight hard every day despite the doubts and uncertainties.</p> 
 <p>That was why his mind was extremely tired out.</p> 
 <p>Seeing people from his past at such a moment would make anybody become emotional like this.</p> 
 <p>That was why Cale started to speak as Kim Rok Soo normally would, despite how happy he was to see Lee Soo Hyuk.</p> 
 <p>“How about you move away?”</p> 
 <p>Lee Soo Hyuk's shoulders lifted up a bit.</p> 
 <p>He was laughing.</p> 
 <p>“Wow. Kim Rok Soo, you haven’t changed.”</p> 
 <p>He seemed even happier to see him.</p> 
 <p>Cale continued to speak to Lee Soo Hyuk.</p> 
 <p>“Grandma and some others are here too. Are you not going to greet them?”<br> “You really like to take care of other people.”</p> 
 <p>Lee Soo Hyuk said that as he patted Cale's shoulder and then walked past him.</p> 
 <p>He first ran into the three monsters that were with Cale.</p> 
 <p>Lee Soo Hyuk looked at the monsters one by one and made eye contact with each of them.</p> 
 <p>The Steel Feather Hawk and White Rabbit's eyes clouded over.</p> 
 <p>‘He’s not afraid.’</p> 
 <p>It would be normal to be at least a little scared or have a slight change in his emotional state, but the human that Kim Rok Soo had been looking for didn't budge at all even when looking at two monsters.</p> 
 <p>‘He's not afraid even though he’s weak.’</p> 
 <p>He was definitely weak unlike Choi Han and Kim Rok Soo, but he was also not weak.</p> 
 <p>Of course, they could feel that he was much stronger than the other humans.</p> 
 <p>Lee Soo Hyuk didn't know what the monsters were thinking about as he then turned to make eye contact with the Dark Tiger.</p> 
 <p>Smile.</p> 
 <p>Lee Soo Hyuk could see the tiger monster start to smile. Then the tiger monster started to speak.</p> 
 <p>“Nice to meet you.”</p> 
 <p>‘Hmm?’</p> 
 <p>Lee Soo Hyuk’s eyebrows slightly rose up.</p> 
 <p>“I am Kim Rok Soo's hyung, Alberu Crossman. I'm happy to meet the person my dongsaeng has been trying to find.”</p> 
 <p>Alberu stopped there and quietly observed Lee Soo Hyuk.</p> 
 <p>Lee Soo Hyuk quietly observed Alberu as well before one corner of his lips rose up.</p> 
 <p>“Wow.”</p> 
 <p>A small gasp of admiration flowed out of his mouth.</p> 
 <p>Lee Soo Hyuk looked away from the monsters and looked back at Cale for a moment before turning back toward Alberu without saying anything.</p> 
 <p>He then started to speak.</p> 
 <p>“How old are you?”<br> “…What?”</p> 
 <p>Alberu’s pupils shook slightly.</p> 
 <p>Lee Soo Hyuk didn't care; he walked over to Alberu, put his hand on Alberu's mane, and started to caress it as he continued to speak.</p> 
 <p>“Kim Rok Soo wouldn't call me hyung no matter how many times I told him to do that. But he's apparently willing to call you hyung. I'm jealous.”</p> 
 <p>Lee Soo Hyuk laughed as he asked again.</p> 
 <p>“So, how old are you?”</p> 
 <p>Alberu flinched and looked toward Cale.</p> 
 <p>Cale was shaking his head as if he knew Lee Soo Hyuk would act this way.</p> 
 <p>Alberu watched Cale for a moment before looking back at Lee Soo Hyuk.</p> 
 <p>‘…His gaze shows no fear.’</p> 
 <p>He was smiling, but he was giving off a demeanor that was hard to approach based on his gaze. But the odd thing was that, although he was giving off this hard to approach demeanor, he also gave off a demeanor that made someone want to approach him.</p> 
 <p>The easiest way to describe it would be that his overall demeanor was charismatic.</p> 
 <p>Alberu observed this person named Lee Soo Hyuk as he started to speak.</p> 
 <p>“I am 25 years old.”</p> 
 <p>Lee Soo Hyuk smiled as if he was thankful that Alberu had answered before responding.</p> 
 <p>"Then I am older.”</p> 
 <p>Pat, pat. </p> 
 <p>He then patted Alberu’s back before walking past him.</p> 
 <p>He didn't seem to care much about the three monsters.</p> 
 <p>But Alberu noticed that Lee Soo Hyuk's gaze had already observed both the monsters and the other humans.</p> 
 <p>‘Cale Henituse said he learned things from Lee Soo Hyuk, right?’</p> 
 <p>Alberu could tell that Lee Soo Hyuk and Cale had a lot of similarities.</p> 
 <p>Cale must have learned a lot of things from Lee Soo Hyuk.</p> 
 <p>‘But the ‘current’ Cale Henituse is more proficient at it.’</p> 
 <p>It made sense that Cale was more proficient at it at this moment as he was in his late thirties.</p> 
 <p>Alberu quietly observed Lee Soo Hyuk’s back.</p> 
 <p>This was the same for the others as well.</p> 
 <p>Kim Po-Chul and the others who had joined Cale in Gyeongju looked toward Lee Soo Hyuk slightly tensely.</p> 
 <p>They couldn't help it because of how Lee Soo Hyuk looked.</p> 
 <p>Kim Po-Chul subconsciously started to speak.</p> 
 <p>“…All that blood.”</p> 
 <p>He could see the red stains on the black outfit.</p> 
 <p>They must be blood, but how many monsters must he have killed in order to look like that?</p> 
 <p>“Mm.”</p> 
 <p>Kim Po-Chul quickly closed his mouth.</p> 
 <p>Lee Soo Hyuk observed him for a moment before walking past him.</p> 
 <p>“…Wow.’</p> 
 <p>Kim Po-Chul was gasping internally.</p> 
 <p>‘He’s a total sword, a sword.’</p> 
 <p>Unlike how he had smiled brightly toward Kim Rok Soo or as he looked this way, he looked so cold just now such that he resembled a sword.</p> 
 <p>Kim Po-Chul subconsciously turned toward Choi Han after thinking about swords.</p> 
 <p>Lee Soo Hyuk’s gaze stopped on Choi Han for a moment as well.</p> 
 <p>‘Hmm?’</p> 
 <p>His eyes opened wide for a moment.</p> 
 <p>It was because Choi Han who had been just standing there now slowly bowed toward Lee Soo Hyuk to greet him.</p> 
 <p>‘Wait, is it a greeting?’</p> 
 <p>It felt as if… Choi Han was thanking him.</p> 
 <p>Lee Soo Hyuk looked toward Choi Han with an odd gaze because he felt that way.</p> 
 <p>Choi Han reached his hand out at that moment.</p> 
 <p>“My name is Choi Han. I heard you are the person who saved Rok Soo hyung. Nice to meet you, sir.”<br> “Ah.”</p> 
 <p>‘He really is thanking me.’</p> 
 <p>Lee Soo Hyuk could understand the hidden meaning behind Choi Han’s extremely respectful greeting.</p> 
 <p>“It wasn’t much at all, sir.”<br> “Please speak informally.”<br> “Okay.”</p> 
 <p>Lee Soo Hyuk lightly shook Choi Han's hand.</p> 
 <p>He then started to laugh as he started to speak.</p> 
 <p>“You’re quite strong, aren't you?”<br> “…Excuse me?”<br> “I can tell by your hand.”</p> 
 <p>Lee Soo Hyuk looked down at Choi Han’s hands that were full of calluses and scars.</p> 
 <p>Choi Han could finally see Lee Soo Hyuk’s gaze that was cold even as he was laughing.</p> 
 <p>“…I am quite strong.”<br> “That’s great.”</p> 
 <p>Lee Soo Hyuk then walked past Choi Han, took a quick look at Choi Jung Soo, and then walked toward the others in the back.</p> 
 <p>Choi Han quietly observed Lee Soo Hyuk.</p> 
 <p>He was really thankful to Lee Soo Hyuk.</p> 
 <p>Lee Soo Hyuk was someone who had looked after Choi Jung Soo and Cale as if they were family.</p> 
 <p>He was someone who had saved Cale and even died in his place.</p> 
 <p>There was someone else who had died in Cale’s place as well.</p> 
 <p>Choi Han's gaze moved to Choi Jung Soo.</p> 
 <p>Choi Jung Soo was quietly looking at Lee Soo Hyuk and the sword at his waist.</p> 
 <p>‘Normally, Lee Soo Hyuk would have hugged Choi Jung Soo just as he had hugged Cale-nim.’</p> 
 <p>Choi Jung Soo and Lee Soo Hyuk did not know each other right now.</p> 
 <p>They had met for the first time today.</p> 
 <p>Choi Han looked toward Cale. He immediately made eye contact with Cale.</p> 
 <p>‘Cale-nim is also looking at Choi Jung Soo and Lee Soo Hyuk as I expected.’</p> 
 <p>He was watching how the two of them were crossing paths.</p> 
 <p>Choi Han could not imagine what Cale must be feeling right now.</p> 
 <p>But it hurt him to just think about it.</p> 
 <p>However…</p> 
 <p>‘They’ll naturally become connected.’</p> 
 <p>Choi Jung Soo, Lee Soo Hyuk, and Kim Rok Soo.</p> 
 <p>These three people will naturally become connected.</p> 
 <p>‘…And me too.’</p> 
 <p>He needed to connect with them too.</p> 
 <p>Choi Han walked over to Choi Jung Soo who was frowning while looking at Lee Soo Hyuk.</p> 
 <p>Choi Jung Soo then flinched and looked toward Choi Han.</p> 
 <p>Choi Han didn’t even look at Jung Soo as he looked toward Lee Soo Hyuk and started to speak.</p> 
 <p>“This sir uses the sword well too.”<br> “…Excuse me?”</p> 
 <p>Choi Jung Soo was flustered that Choi Han was suddenly talking about him.</p> 
 <p>For the past few days, no, the two of them had not chatted since they greeted each other during their first meeting.</p> 
 <p>Choi Jung Soo was finding it difficult to say anything to Choi Han because his mind became chaotic every time he saw Choi Han’s sword art.</p> 
 <p>‘Who is this person? Who the hell is he that-’</p> 
 <p>How was he using a sword art that was similar to the ancient sword art passed down in his family?</p> 
 <p>‘His last name is also Choi.’</p> 
 <p>Choi Jung Soo thought his head was going to blow up.</p> 
 <p>It was at that moment.</p> 
 <p>He heard Choi Han's voice.</p> 
 <p>“Don't you want to learn how to use the sword?”<br> “Ah.”</p> 
 <p>Choi Jung Soo gasped. Choi Han looked toward Choi Jung Soo and continued to speak.</p> 
 <p>“You cannot ask any questions.”</p> 
 <p>For Choi Han, Choi Jung Soo's questions…</p> 
 <p>And the truth behind them that might be revealed was a burden.</p> 
 <p>“I will only teach you sword arts.”</p> 
 <p>Choi Jung Soo looked toward Choi Han who was younger than him and started to speak.</p> 
 <p>“Why can’t I ask any questions?”<br> “…I said no questions, sir.”</p> 
 <p>Choi Han then walked over to Cale.</p> 
 <p>Choi Jung Soo quietly stared at Choi Han and Cale.</p> 
 <p>Lee Soo Hyuk had moved over to Grandma Kim while that happened.</p> 
 <p>"Grandma.”<br> “…Aigoo. Soo Hyuk.”</p> 
 <p>Grandma Kim touched Lee Soo Hyuk’s hands with shaking hands.</p> 
 <p>“Why… do you look like this? Aigoo.”</p> 
 <p>Grandma Kim touched Lee Soo Hyuk’s face, arms, and shoulders without being able to say anything.</p> 
 <p>“…Oppa.”<br> “Hey, Jin Joo. Seung Won.”</p> 
 <p>Lee Soo Hyuk smiled toward Lee Jin Joo and Lee Seung Won who had walked up to him. But the siblings had similar expressions as Grandma Kim.</p> 
 <p>The Lee Soo Hyuk who had left their central shelter and the Lee Soo Hyuk here looked completely different.</p> 
 <p>The current Lee Soo Hyuk looked tired and worn out, unlike before.</p> 
 <p>During the whole trip since they decided to come here to Seomyeon, Busan, and followed the Gyeongbu Expressway up…</p> 
 <p>They had never expressed Lee Soo Hyuk to look like this.</p> 
 <p>A strong leader.</p> 
 <p>A leader they could trust and follow.</p> 
 <p>That was what they were expecting to see, but…</p> 
 <p>The reality was different than their imaginations.</p> 
 <p>Lee Soo Hyuk smiled at all of them who could not control their emotions while looking at him before motioning to the person in the far back.</p> 
 <p>“Park Jin Tae.”</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae was standing firm as if he had turned into a boulder and could not look away from Lee Soo Hyuk.</p> 
 <p>Lee Soo Hyuk mischievously started to speak to Park Jin Tae.</p> 
 <p>“Hey, Jin Tae. Are you not going to come here? Are you not happy to see me?”</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae slowly started to speak.</p> 
 <p>“…Holy crap. You look like shit.”</p> 
 <p>His voice then became sharp.</p> 
 <p>“Holy shit, why the hell do you look so terrible?!”<br> “What’s wrong with how I look?”</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae became truly angry at Lee Soo Hyuk who was looking at him as if nothing was wrong.</p> 
 <p>He could not understand why he was feeling this way.</p> 
 <p>But it made him angry.</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae observed how Lee Soo Hyuk looked as he thought to himself.</p> 
 <p>‘It’s obvious what happened.’</p> 
 <p>He probably ended up looking like this after saying he would do all the difficult things and trying to save people.</p> 
 <p>It wasn't like he was a god or a machine.</p> 
 <p>As a human, he should be tired and feeling his limits.</p> 
 <p>‘I, I-’</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae thought about his actions since Lee Soo Hyuk had left.</p> 
 <p>Furthermore, he took another look at the person he was chasing after, the person he wanted to overcome.</p> 
 <p>“…Fuck.”<br> “Hey, Jin Tae. What’s with your language after seeing your hyung for the first time in a long while?”</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae turned away.</p> 
 <p>Lee Soo Hyuk looked at Park Jin Tae for a moment before lowering his head.</p> 
 <p>“Hmm.”</p> 
 <p>Lee Seung Won and Lee Jin Joo's gazes looked a little different as they peeked at him talking to Park Jin Tae.</p> 
 <p>Lee Jin Joo turned her head and Lee Seung Won opened and closed his mouth without saying anything once they made eye contact with him.</p> 
 <p>Furthermore.</p> 
 <p>“Lee Chul Min.”<br> “Uhh, uhh?”</p> 
 <p>Lee Chul Min awkwardly bowed and greeted Lee Soo Hyuk. He looked quite uncomfortable.</p> 
 <p>‘Something's up.’</p> 
 <p>Lee Soo Hyuk’s eyebrow twitched again after sensing something was off.</p> 
 <p>But more importantly…</p> 
 <p>“First.”</p> 
 <p>He slowly turned around.</p> 
 <p>The people who came all the way here to meet Lee Soo Hyuk had a thought at this moment.</p> 
 <p>‘He’s the Lee Soo Hyuk of old.’</p> 
 <p>His nonchalant-looking but sharp gaze headed toward Cale and the others.</p> 
 <p>“I guess I should hear why you came to see me and what is going on?”</p> 
 <p>Cale was the one to answer his question.</p> 
 <p>“Sounds great.”</p> 
 <p>Cale then added on.</p> 
 <p>“Ah, by the way.”</p> 
 <p>He started to speak to Lee Soo Hyuk who was looking at him with confusion as well as the people looking toward them from the castle walls and the castle gate.</p> 
 <p>“I don't want to have to repeat myself multiple times; you have a large meeting room, right? Please call over every important person.”</p> 
 <p>It was tiring to say the same thing over and over.</p> 
 <p>“I want to say it just once.”</p> 
 <hr> 
 <p>In a large meeting room in the central castle at Seomyeon, Busan.</p> 
 <p>Once he had described everything…</p> 
 <p>Cale and Lee Soo Hyuk looked at each other.</p> 
 <p>“Kim Rok Soo.”<br> “Yes, sir.”</p> 
 <p>Lee Soo Hyuk quietly observed Kim Rok Soo who was looking back at him with a calm expression before starting to speak.</p> 
 <p>His slow voice echoed through the meeting room.</p> 
 <p>“Rok Soo. You said everybody here would die?”</p> 
 <p>Everybody was silent as they looked at Lee Soo Hyuk and Cale.</p> 
 <p>There was an extremely cold and sharp aura that felt as if it cut through anything coming out of Lee Soo Hyuk.</p> 
 <p>But Cale was calm as he looked into those cold eyes.</p> 
 <p>“Yes, sir. Most people here will die.”<br> “You. Are you being serious right now?<br> “Yes. I am completely being serious.”<br> “You think I would believe you?”</p> 
 <p>Cale started to smile.</p> 
 <p>‘Why is he asking such an obvious question?’</p> 
 <p>“Yes, sir. You already believe what I said.”</p> 
 <p>One corner of Lee Soo Hyuk's lips started to go up.</p> 
 <p>“Yes. I believe you.”</p>
