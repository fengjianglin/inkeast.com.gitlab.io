 <p>“…My goodness.”</p> 
 <p>Rosalyn peeked toward Duke Fredo with a, ‘what kind of nonsense is this?’ type of expression without any awkwardness after not seeing everyone for a while.</p> 
 <p>She then asked Cale a question out of concern.</p> 
 <p>“I'm surprised that your blood is delicious for the Vampires, young master Cale. Why is that the case?”<br> “…I wonder why?”</p> 
 <p>Cale awkwardly answered back but he had a theory about it.</p> 
 <p>‘Is it because of the Vitality of the Heart?’</p> 
 <p>That was the only reasonable explanation he could come up with.<br> Cale slowly turned away from Rosalyn and looked toward Duke Fredo.<br> Rosalyn looked toward the Vampire as well.</p> 
 <p>Fredo continued to smile as he looked at the two of them.<br> He then quietly spoke, almost in a whisper, in a low voice.</p> 
 <p>“Your conversation is cute.”</p> 
 <p>Rosalyn and Cale both started to frown as if they had eaten an unripe fruit.<br> However, the two of them did not have time to respond in any other way.</p> 
 <p>Duuuduuduuu-</p> 
 <p>The rumbling was getting closer.<br> The rumbling seemed to be coming from a spot much closer than last time.</p> 
 <p>‘We need to go!’</p> 
 <p>It was time to move.</p> 
 <p>Cale started to speak.</p> 
 <p>“You said that you want to make a deal with me?”<br> “Yes.”<br> “Really?”</p> 
 <p>Pan started to frown and look toward Cale who asked once more.</p> 
 <p>‘Is he really planning on working together with that person? …But he’s the leader of the bastards who killed our Brigade members.’</p> 
 <p>Pan felt anger inside. However, he kept that anger inside him.</p> 
 <p>There were no allies and enemies in war.<br> There were times people who were killing each other would find a common enemy to become allies.</p> 
 <p>Pan just found it difficult to understand Cale who was acting like this.</p> 
 <p>‘The enemies are charging toward us from behind. Do we have the time for this?’</p> 
 <p>It happened as he subconsciously started to pout and his mouth almost opened to say something.</p> 
 <p>Duke Fredo looked toward Cale and calmly responded.</p> 
 <p>“Yes. I truly want to make a deal with you.”<br> “I can't trust you.”</p> 
 <p>The allies looked toward Cale who sternly responded.<br> Many of them were showing their anxiousness at Cale who was wasting time with this conversation.</p> 
 <p>Cale pointed behind him at that moment.</p> 
 <p>“Show me proof that you mean it.”</p> 
 <p>Fredo started to smile.</p> 
 <p>"Are you telling me to attack my allies right now?”<br> “That's for you to figure out. I will accept your invitation later if you show me some kind of proof that I can trust you.”</p> 
 <p>Duke Fredo lightly chuckled and asked while looking at a relaxed Cale.</p> 
 <p>“You won’t accept the deal but just the invitation?”</p> 
 <p>The corners of Cale’s lips twisted up.</p> 
 <p>"Why are you asking such an obvious question? Isn’t it more than enough for me to hear out the bastard who killed my allies?”</p> 
 <p>Pan's eyes clouded over.<br> On the other hand, Duke Fredo thought for a moment before nodding his head.</p> 
 <p>“Mm. I guess that makes sense, but I cannot fight against my allies right now.”</p> 
 <p>He looked toward Cale as if he was asking for Cale’s understanding before continuing to speak.</p> 
 <p>“I need to be wary of some people's feelings right now.”</p> 
 <p>‘Be wary of some people’s feelings?’</p> 
 <p>Cale made sure to remember those words.</p> 
 <p>‘A Duke should be the highest title of the nobles, but he needs to be wary of someone else right now.’</p> 
 <p>Was he someone without much strength?</p> 
 <p>‘No. He’s stronger than the other bastards.’</p> 
 <p>His battle experiences had helped him develop an eye for people. The Vampire in front of him was much scarier than the Knights Brigade chasing behind them.</p> 
 <p>‘That’s why Bud hasn't said anything about defeating this guy and running away to avoid the Knights Brigade.’</p> 
 <p>Bud had been quiet since earlier, only paying attention to the enemies approaching from the rear.<br> Cale recalled all those points in his head while keeping his gaze focused on the Vampire. Fredo started to speak as if to respond to his gaze.</p> 
 <p>“Liana.”</p> 
 <p>‘Who is that?’</p> 
 <p>Cale could see Choi Han’s sword point elsewhere as he flinched at the name he did not recognize.</p> 
 <p>“Yes. My liege.”</p> 
 <p>Rustle.</p> 
 <p>Someone jumped off the tree right behind the group.<br> The pale woman was definitely a Vampire.</p> 
 <p>“Give them a map of this area.”<br> “…We already have a map of this area?”</p> 
 <p>Cale responded.</p> 
 <p>“Just take it first.”</p> 
 <p>Duke Fredo told him to take the item from the woman who had approached him while walking without making any noise and Cale stood still for a moment before taking it.</p> 
 <p>“……!”</p> 
 <p>He then could not hide his shock.<br> Rosalyn who had been looking at the map over Cale's shoulder subconsciously started to speak.</p> 
 <p>“The Gate-”</p> 
 <p>However, she covered her mouth after saying two words.<br> She then looked toward Cale. The two of them gulped while looking at each other.<br> Cale could not help but clench the hand holding the map.</p> 
 <p>‘…It’s a map of the Gate to the Demon World!’</p> 
 <p>The Gate to the Demon World, the large sinkhole that was one of the Eastern continent's Three Restricted Areas.</p> 
 <p>This map had information about the inside of that sinkhole.<br> Cale realized something the moment he saw the information.</p> 
 <p>‘It’s a kingdom.’</p> 
 <p>The large sinkhole was a large kingdom divided into many floors.<br> It was not just a simple hole.<br> There was already a large city inside the large hole that was as wide as many villages put together.</p> 
 <p>Cale heard Duke Fredo's voice in his mind at that moment.</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>It is the Endable Kingdom.</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>This was a map of the kingdom as Cale had expected.</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>As you expected, we have created a kingdom. The kingdom starts in the northern region past this mountain, with our capital located inside the sinkhole with the Gate to the Demon World.</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>Cale could feel his heart beating wildly.</p> 
 <p>This was a key.</p> 
 <p>This battle that was divided into four locations… And the enemies chasing behind Cale and the allies to stop them…<br> This was a key to instantly flip things over if they managed to endure past all of this.</p> 
 <p>“…Do you know the meaning of giving this to me?”</p> 
 <p>Cale was the White Star's enemy.<br> Duke Fredo's allies were currently trying to catch Cale as well.</p> 
 <p>However, This Duke had given Cale lots of information about their base.<br> It was the truth about a place that had been thoroughly kept a secret.</p> 
 <p>‘Is this bastard crazy?’</p> 
 <p>Cale looked toward Duke Fredo and heard his voice in his mind.</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>Of course. I know the value of what I gave you.</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>‘No. This bastard is not crazy. There’s something he wants. What could it be?’</p> 
 <p>Cale now knew about the kingdom's location, name, and Duke Fredo's position.<br> However, there was one thing he did not know.</p> 
 <p>‘The White Star. What position does that bastard have in the Endable Kingdom?’</p> 
 <p>Cale’s mind quickly processed information and put together many different pieces to figure things out.</p> 
 <p>Cale finally started to speak after a while.</p> 
 <p>"What is the White Star's position?”</p> 
 <p>Cale repeated the question he had asked before.<br> Unlike last time, Fredo answered the question.</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>The White Star can be considered our, ‘liege.’ But he is not our ‘king.’ He needs to complete the mission given to him in order to become the king.</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>It was at that moment.</p> 
 <p>“Ha, haha-”</p> 
 <p>Cale started to laugh.<br> The others looked toward him with confusion but Cale slowly started to walk.<br> He walked up to Duke Fredo.</p> 
 <p>“Cale-nim.”</p> 
 <p>Choi Han tried to stop Cale but Cale motioned that it was okay before walking right up to Duke Fredo.<br> He then brought his face close to Fredo's ear and started to whisper.<br> He was speaking so quietly that only Fredo would hear.</p> 
 <p>“You want to be king, don't you?”</p> 
 <p>Cale’s eyes were full of certainty as he asked in a laughing voice.</p> 
 <p>Duke Fredo had said the following.</p> 
 <p>The White Star, who was their liege by name, would become the true king if he could complete his mission.<br> But what happens if he can't complete that mission?</p> 
 <p>This bastard had said since earlier that he would only tell Cale the truth.<br> The things he said brushed past Cale’s mind.</p> 
 <p>‘I am a Vampire who knows about grace and pride. That is why I won't serve anyone.’<br> ‘I will only tell you the truth. I truly do not serve anyone.’</p> 
 <p>He did not serve the White Star or the Demonic race.</p> 
 <p>He did not place anyone above him.<br> There was nobody he truly served.</p> 
 <p>What could that mean?</p> 
 <p>“You want that king position for yourself.”</p> 
 <p>‘That’s why he's betraying his allies and trying to cooperate with me, the enemy.’</p> 
 <p>“You don’t care about the Demonic race at all. All you care about is becoming king. Am I right?”</p> 
 <p>Cale moved his face away from Fredo's ear.</p> 
 <p>‘He’s just joking when he says he wants my blood. His true goal is to become the king.’</p> 
 <p>He was certain that his thoughts were correct after seeing Duke Fredo's face.</p> 
 <p>Smirk.</p> 
 <p>Duke Fredo had a painting-like smile on his face.<br> He slowly whispered so that only Cale could hear.</p> 
 <p>“Correct. I wish to be king.”</p> 
 <p>Cale put the map in his pocket and responded.</p> 
 <p>“I’ll be waiting for your invitation.”<br> “I'll send the invitation soon.”</p> 
 <p>Shhhhhh-</p> 
 <p>Duke Fredo's body slowly started to turn black.</p> 
 <p>His black skin dispersed like ash and his body started to disappear.</p> 
 <p>Duke Fredo started to speak at that moment.</p> 
 <p>“I'll give you one more present.”</p> 
 <p>Cale who was walking toward the snowy region, stopped.<br> Duke Fredo who was disappearing with his subordinate Liana said something as the last few bits of ashes disappeared into the air.</p> 
 <p>“The White Star went to the Roan Kingdom a moment ago.”</p> 
 <p>‘…Where did the White Star go?’</p> 
 <p>Cale’s eyes opened wide.<br> Fredo continued to speak as he did that.</p> 
 <p>His voice was slowly getting quieter as his body disappeared.<br> However, Cale still heard him properly.</p> 
 <p>“The White Star knows very well. He knows that when you are lacking information, everything can be resolved by having the life of the leader in his hands.”</p> 
 <p>Duke Fredo disappeared after saying that.<br> They had no way of knowing where nor how he disappeared.</p> 
 <p>However, that was not important.<br> Rosalyn subconsciously shouted.</p> 
 <p>“…Marquis Taylor!”</p> 
 <p>The White Star would head to the Roan Kingdom’s Northwest region.</p> 
 <p>The White Star would try to quickly find the ancient power while Cale was elsewhere.</p> 
 <p>‘That means that he needs to quickly gather information about that region in order to find the information he needs!’</p> 
 <p>The easiest way to do that was to capture the leader and get information out of that person as Duke Fredo mentioned.</p> 
 <p>The leader of the Roan Kingdom’s Northwest region who would have that information was Marquis Taylor Stan.</p> 
 <p>‘We need to save Marquis Taylor!’</p> 
 <p>Rosalyn heard Cale shout at that moment.</p> 
 <p>“F*ck!”</p> 
 <p>She turned her gaze.<br> They needed to quickly head to the Roan Kingdom’s Northwest region.<br> Cale should know that as well.<br> However, Cale's thoughts were different than her thoughts.</p> 
 <p>“…It’s not Marquis Taylor.”</p> 
 <p>Taylor was not the leader.<br> The White Star should know that as well.<br> He should know that the Roan Kingdom had a leader whom even Cale reported to.<br> Information would go past that person or gather to that person.</p> 
 <p>‘The Roan Kingdom has already sent troops to the Northwest region while knowing that the White Star's subordinates are there!’</p> 
 <p>That meant that the troops at the capital would decrease.</p> 
 <p>Would the White Star not know that?<br> Would he miss that fact?</p> 
 <p>Duke Fredo had said the following.</p> 
 <p>‘The White Star went to the Roan Kingdom a moment ago.’</p> 
 <p>The Roan Kingdom had not discovered the White Star's subordinates a moment ago.<br> He had already heard about that from crown prince Alberu while he was fighting in the maze underneath the Molden palace.</p> 
 <p>That meant that the White Star was moving separately from the White Star's subordinates who have been discovered in the Roan Kingdom.</p> 
 <p>“…We need to hurry to the palace.”</p> 
 <p>Alberu Crossman.</p> 
 <p>The White Star would aim for him.</p> 
 <p>“This is driving me crazy.”</p> 
 <p>Cale started to frown.</p> 
 <p>‘Alberu Crossman, if it is him?!’</p> 
 <p>“That person is probably heading to the Northwest region and not in the palace.”</p> 
 <p>He asked Raon to connect the call before quickly heading to the snowy region.</p> 
 <hr> 
 <p>Alberu gave an order to his servant.</p> 
 <p>"Go bring me my armor.”</p> 
 <p>Screeeech-</p> 
 <p>The large door then opened.</p> 
 <p>“Your highness!”</p> 
 <p>Piiiiiiiiiii- Piiiiiiiiiiii-</p> 
 <p>Alberu’s vassals calling for him from past the door and the emergency alarm were mixing together.</p> 
 <p>Alberu stepped through the door.</p>
