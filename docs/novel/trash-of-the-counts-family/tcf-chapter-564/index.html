 <p>It was a funny story.</p> 
 <p>It was back when Kim Rok Soo was looking up information on the unranked monsters and their appearances and recording everything that he found.</p> 
 <p>There was something eye-catching regarding this destruction of the original central shelters and the monster attacks prior to the appearance of the first unranked monster.</p> 
 <p>‘It was the appearance of the taster monsters.’</p> 
 <p>From Grade 3 to Grade 2…</p> 
 <p>And again from Grade 2 to Grade 1…</p> 
 <p>The taster monsters appeared at each switch between grades.</p> 
 <p>Cale couldn't forget the word, ‘taster.’</p> 
 <p>It remained on his mind even without using his record ability.</p> 
 <p>The first taster monsters.</p> 
 <p>The Grade 1 taster monsters that appeared during the shift from Grade 3 to Grade 2 monsters were what had destroyed Kim Rok Soo's first central shelter.</p> 
 <p>Many people had died.</p> 
 <p>‘It was difficult to fight against even one Grade 1 monster during this time.’</p> 
 <p>People didn't know how to use their abilities properly yet.</p> 
 <p>They didn't have enough information.</p> 
 <p>Kim Rok Soo had seen the people die by these taster monsters as he ran away.</p> 
 <p>That was why he didn't like them being called tasters.</p> 
 <p>But the scary part was…</p> 
 <p>‘They really were tasters.’</p> 
 <p>The upcoming Grade 1 monsters’ attack and the invasion of the unranked monster in the near future.</p> 
 <p>These were definitely tasters in comparison to those two incidents.</p> 
 <p>They needed to overcome it.</p> 
 <p>They needed to do it without taking much damage.</p> 
 <p>Cale opened his mouth to speak.</p> 
 <p>“The overall situation is that the monsters will attack by their grade, but as I mentioned before, there are some special moments in between.”<br> “Hey, Rok Soo.”</p> 
 <p>Jang Man Soo and Choi Han who was carrying him on his back walked over to Cale.</p> 
 <p>“You worked hard, mister.”<br> “No, I should be okay again after resting an hour or two.”<br> “I understand. Please get some rest.”</p> 
 <p>The shield would be usable again in two hours.</p> 
 <p>Jang Man Soo hesitated for a moment before starting to speak.</p> 
 <p>“…Will we be able to defeat the Grade 1 monsters? Especially when there will be 7 of them?”</p> 
 <p>Everybody around Cale suddenly became quiet.</p> 
 <p>Seven Grade 1 monsters.</p> 
 <p>That number made everybody feel as if they would suffocate.</p> 
 <p>A fierce battle was continuing on the roof as that was going on.</p> 
 <p>“Keep dropping things!”<br> “Keep it up!”<br> “Use a little more of your psychokinesis!”</p> 
 <p>The people on the roof ledge were throwing everything they had, including weak attacks, toward the Grade 3 monsters trying to climb over the wall of fallen monsters and debris.</p> 
 <p>That was why they could not tell these people.</p> 
 <p>They couldn’t know that seven Grade 1 monsters would soon appear.</p> 
 <p>They would lose their will to fight.</p> 
 <p>Even Jang Man Soo was this scared.</p> 
 <p>It was at that moment.</p> 
 <p>“It’s possible.”</p> 
 <p>Someone other than Cale had responded.</p> 
 <p>It was Park Jin Tae.</p> 
 <p>He was looking at Choi Han who was carrying Jang Man Soo with a piercing gaze.</p> 
 <p>“We can manage to deal with seven of them.”</p> 
 <p>Smile. </p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae smiled toward Choi Han who was looking at him.</p> 
 <p>Cale started to speak at that moment.</p> 
 <p>“Choi Han will not be participating this time.”<br> “…What?”</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae and the others all opened their eyes in shock.</p> 
 <p>“How can we do it without this bastard-”<br> “Night.”</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae shut up after hearing Cale say one word.</p> 
 <p>“You remember what I said, right?”</p> 
 <p>Night.</p> 
 <p>“The moment the sun goes down… The moment the sunset completely disappears…”</p> 
 <p>The moment that darkness falls over the world…</p> 
 <p>“The monsters will go crazy. They will become much more violent than before and their attack strength will multiply by 1.5 times.”</p> 
 <p>That was why night was the first crucial moment.</p> 
 <p>“The Grade 2 and Grade 3 monsters will attack together.”</p> 
 <p>Kim Rok Soo who had run away with the crumbling central shelter behind him remembered that night clearly.</p> 
 <p>He had crawled into a gap between some building debris and watched while keeping quiet.</p> 
 <p>He had seen how the night was turned into hell by those crazed monsters.</p> 
 <p>Numerous humans had died.</p> 
 <p>That night was brutal for the humans who could not gather together and had to split up because the central shelter crumbled down.</p> 
 <p>“Choi Han needs to stay out of this battle for us to be able to survive the night.”</p> 
 <p>Cale and Choi Han would not be able to get any sleep during the night.</p> 
 <p>“This punk needs to get some rest right now.”<br> “…Then-”</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae bit down on his lips. He barely managed to ask.</p> 
 <p>“Then how will we fight them?”</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae was certain.</p> 
 <p>“I'm sure you already have the answer.”</p> 
 <p>He should know how to kill seven Grade 1 monsters.</p> 
 <p>It was at that moment.</p> 
 <p>“Leader-nim!”</p> 
 <p>He heard Lee Chul Min's voice.</p> 
 <p>Everybody looked toward Lee Chul Min who was standing on the ledge and pointing somewhere.</p> 
 <p>“The Grade 2 monsters are starting to get closer!”</p> 
 <p>The Grade 3 monsters around the building were doing everything they could to get inside the building and kill the humans.</p> 
 <p>But the Grade 3 monsters in the distance that had not gotten close yet were slowly moving away.</p> 
 <p>It was as if there was a baton pass.</p> 
 <p>“…They’re making way for the Grade 2 monsters.”</p> 
 <p>As Park Jin Tae mentioned, the Grade 3 monsters were moving back as the Grade 2 monsters got closer.</p> 
 <p>More Grade 2 monsters were starting to appear.</p> 
 <p>A completely different type of pressure than the Grade 3 monsters was starting to overwhelm the people.</p> 
 <p>Tick tock.</p> 
 <p>Cale looked at the watch.</p> 
 <p>It was past 2 pm already.</p> 
 <p>It would be 3 pm soon enough.</p> 
 <p>The taster Grade 1 monsters would appear at 3 pm.</p> 
 <p>“A, and-”</p> 
 <p>Lee Chul Min’s voice was shaking.</p> 
 <p>From within the Grade 3 and Grade 2 monsters that were similar in height…</p> 
 <p>There were oddly tall monsters appearing here and there.</p> 
 <p>“T, they appeared!”</p> 
 <p>The others shouted along with Lee Chul Min.</p> 
 <p>“Gasp! G, Grade 1……!”</p> 
 <p>The people on the southern ledge slowly started to move back.</p> 
 <p>They recognized the Grade 1 monsters.</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae started to mumble.</p> 
 <p>“I'm relieved. At least the Grade 1 monsters are all coming from one direction.”</p> 
 <p>The seven monsters would appear from the south.</p> 
 <p>Only three were visible right now.</p> 
 <p>A monster with a snake head, a monster that seemed to be a mix of a lion and a tiger, and a skeleton-like monster.</p> 
 <p>They were all very different monsters.</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae observed the monsters as he started to speak.</p> 
 <p>“Kim Rok Soo, you said that seven of those bastards would come attacking from the south at 3 pm?”<br> “I did.”</p> 
 <p>His voice was extremely calm.</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae became annoyed at his calmness and looked toward Kim Rok Soo.</p> 
 <p>“Hmm?”</p> 
 <p>He then flinched.</p> 
 <p>“Hey, you-”</p> 
 <p>It was because Kim Rok Soo was looking somewhere else and smiling.</p> 
 <p>The others who looked toward Cale as Park Jin Tae did flinched.</p> 
 <p>Cale started to speak at that moment.</p> 
 <p>“I told you I had foresight, right?”</p> 
 <p>Foresight.</p> 
 <p>Everybody shut up after hearing that word.</p> 
 <p>They had to feel the greatness of Kim Rok Soo's foresight ability. They recalled how Kim Rok Soo had been right about everything until now.</p> 
 <p>“Choi Han will not fight.”</p> 
 <p>There wasn't even the slightest of openings in his stern voice.</p> 
 <p>‘Do we need to take care of it on our own?’</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae started to frown.</p> 
 <p>He knew Kim Rok Soo must have a way for them to defeat them on their own, but he was worried.</p> 
 <p>He heard Kim Rok Soo's parched voice at that moment.</p> 
 <p>“But there are others who will fight with us.”</p> 
 <p>‘What?’</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae's eyes opened wide.</p> 
 <p>However, Cale was still looking to the north as he put a hand on Lee Jin Joo's shoulder.</p> 
 <p>“Noona.”<br> “Hmm, hmm?”<br> “Repeat what I say loud enough so that it can reach that building.”</p> 
 <p>Cale was pointing to a building to the north.</p> 
 <p>It was a pretty tall building that was barely standing up as half of it was broken.</p> 
 <p>‘Hmm?’</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae could see human-like figures where Cale was pointing.</p> 
 <p>‘Two people?’</p> 
 <p>He could see two people.</p> 
 <p>‘This bastard, perhaps?’</p> 
 <p>Were these the people who would fight with them?</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae got chills and looked toward Cale, but Cale was just telling Lee Jin Joo what to say.</p> 
 <p>“Stop peeking glances while running away. Come here if you want to survive.”</p> 
 <p>Cale recalled a conversation in his mind even as he told Jin Joo what to say.</p> 
 <p>‘Team leader-nim, team leader-nim! Are you not going to wake up?’</p> 
 <p>When he had to face his despair while under Elisneh the First's illusion in the Molden Kingdom…</p> 
 <p>Of the two people who had appeared in his illusion…</p> 
 <p>One of them was Jung So Hoon.</p> 
 <p>‘…Should I make a cup ramen?’</p> 
 <p>The rookie Jung So Hoon had asked if he had wanted some ramen.</p> 
 <p>And the other person…</p> 
 <p>‘Team leader-nim! Is this the time to be eating ramen? Are you eating one too because that punk is eating one?’</p> 
 <p>Assistant Leader Kim Min Ah.</p> 
 <p>She was one of the vanguard members for Cale’s attack team.</p> 
 <p>She was married and had a cute daughter named Bae Eun Soo.</p> 
 <p>Cale recalled a conversation he had with Kim Min Ah while he was Team leader Kim Rok Soo.</p> 
 <p>‘…You were there?’<br> ‘Yes, sir. I was running away, saw that place, and ran away again. I'm more shocked that you were from there. You managed to survive even without any abilities at that time.’</p> 
 <p>She had mentioned that she had visited the central shelter where Cale had been.</p> 
 <p>In fact, she was there on the day the central shelter crumbled.</p> 
 <p>‘Around what time?’<br> ‘Probably around 2 pm or 3 pm on the first day? The taster Grade 1 monsters appeared not too long after I got there.’</p> 
 <p>The corners of Cale’s lips started to go up.</p> 
 <p>She had said the following.</p> 
 <p>‘I was with the punk who would become my husband at that time. I dragged him around. Ahahahaha!’</p> 
 <p>Cale called out toward the two people who were in that building up north and looking toward them.</p> 
 <p>“Kim Min Ah, Bae Puh Rum. Come join us here.”</p> 
 <p>Cale looked toward Lee Jin Joo.</p> 
 <p>“Noona, are you not going to say it?”<br> “Huh?”</p> 
 <p>Lee Jin Joo blinked in shock before starting to speak.</p> 
 <p>“Do you know them?”<br> “No, I don’t.”<br> “…Then?”<br> “Didn't I tell you I have the power of foresight? The two of them are strong.”</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae quietly mumbled at that moment.</p> 
 <p>“That crazy foresight ability.”</p> 
 <p>Cale completely ignored him and looked at Lee Jin Joo.</p> 
 <p>Lee Jin Joo snapped out of it and started to speak.</p> 
 <p>{Stop peeking glances while running away. Come here if you want to survive.}</p> 
 <p>The two people's bodies shifted significantly at that moment.</p> 
 <p>They seemed to be shocked.</p> 
 <p>Lee Jin Joo watched their reaction as she continued to speak.</p> 
 <p>{Kim Min Ah, Bae Puh Rum. Come join us here.}</p> 
 <p>Cale started to speak again.</p> 
 <p>“Bae Puh Rum. Fly over.”</p> 
 <p>{Bae Puh Rum. Fly over.}</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae walked over to Cale after Lee Jin Joo said that.</p> 
 <p>“Hey! He’s an ability user who can fly?”</p> 
 <p>This was his first time hearing about such an ability.</p> 
 <p>“Yes, sir. Look over there.”</p> 
 <p>Cale motioned to the northern building with his chin.</p> 
 <p>“He’s flying over.”<br> “…Ho.”</p> 
 <p>A man was flying with a woman on his back as Cale had mentioned.</p> 
 <p>He could see the woman pointing to this side and shouting something.</p> 
 <p>‘This crazy Kim Rok Soo!’</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae couldn’t help but be astonished while looking at him.</p> 
 <p>He was thinking that Kim Rok Soo was scary.</p> 
 <p>The ability to fly?</p> 
 <p>The ability to tell the strength of their opponent?</p> 
 <p>Kim Rok Soo had an ability that was much scarier than either of those kinds of abilities.</p> 
 <p>“Hey!”</p> 
 <p>The woman who was on the man’s back pointed to where Cale was standing.</p> 
 <p>She then started to speak.</p> 
 <p>“Who the hell are you guys?! How do you know who we are?”</p> 
 <p>Wave wave.</p> 
 <p>Cale motioned to them as if telling them to hurry up and get here.</p> 
 <p>Bae Puh Rum and Kim Min Ah chatted with each other for a bit before getting closer to the roof.</p> 
 <p>Cale started to speak at that moment.</p> 
 <p>“Kim Min Ah.”<br> “Who are you and how do you know my name-”<br> “We’ll heal your brother’s injuries.”<br> “…What?”</p> 
 <p>Both Kim Min Ah and Bae Puh Rum looked toward Cale in shock.</p> 
 <p>“Your older brother is in that building over there. He’s in a terrible state right now because of the large injury on his side.”</p> 
 <p>Cale recalled how Kim Min Ah had looked sad in the past.</p> 
 <p>‘I fought with my brother there. He told me to leave him behind and fly away with Bae Puh Rum.’</p> 
 <p>Kim Min Ah had tried her best to smile.</p> 
 <p>‘But I stayed with him until the end. I was relieved I got to spend my brother’s last moments with him.’</p> 
 <p>She had then added on in a joking tone.</p> 
 <p>‘Of course, Bae Puh Rum had to work his ass off to carry me and run away after that.’</p> 
 <p>Cale put a hand on Grandma Kim's shoulder.</p> 
 <p>"We will heal your brother’s external injury. In return, I hope that the two of you can fight with us at this shelter.”</p> 
 <p>Grandma Kim placed her wrinkled hand on Cale’s hand.</p> 
 <p>Cale felt the warmth of her hand as he continued to speak.</p> 
 <p>“Then the two of you, and Kim Min Ah, your brother as well… All of you will survive.”</p> 
 <p>Kim Min Ah and Bae Puh Rum were high school students at this time.</p> 
 <p>The two of them were silent.</p> 
 <p>Bae Puh Rum started to speak at that moment.</p> 
 <p>“Hey, Min Ah. Should I go bring big bro over?”</p> 
 <p>Kim Min Ah started to speak.</p> 
 <p>“Let me down first.”</p> 
 <p>Bae Puh Rum and Kim Min Ah landed on the roof.</p> 
 <p>Lee Chul Min shouted at that moment.</p> 
 <p>“Seven of them! All seven of them have appeared!”</p> 
 <p>The people who were standing on the ledge lowered their hands and looked toward Cale.</p> 
 <p>It was okay for them to do that.</p> 
 <p>“…The monsters are retreating.”</p> 
 <p>The Grade 3 monsters were retreating.</p> 
 <p>They moved farther back than where the Grade 2 monsters were standing. They looked like actors moving off stage after the first act was completed.</p> 
 <p>Boom.</p> 
 <p>A Grade 1 monster with a Bear’s body and purple tiger stripes stomped and shook the ground.</p> 
 <p>Just one monster moving forward felt as if tens of Grade 3 monsters were moving toward them.</p> 
 <p>This was the impact of a Grade 1 monster coming close.</p> 
 <p>“Kim Min Ah.”</p> 
 <p>Cale opened his mouth to speak.</p> 
 <p>“Your brother has the message ability right?”</p> 
 <p>Cale walked past Kim Min Ah as her eyes opened wide.</p> 
 <p>He then stood at the door heading down from the roof and pointed to some people.</p> 
 <p>“Park Jin Tae, Kim Min Ah, Lee Chul Min, Bae Puh Rum. The four of you will fight with me.”</p> 
 <p>Park Jin asked in shock.</p> 
 <p>“Y, you're fighting too?”</p> 
 <p>He looked at Kim Rok Soo’s feeble body.</p> 
 <p>Cale confidently responded while looking at this gaze.</p> 
 <p>“Yes, sir. I am fighting as well.”</p> 
 <p>Cale pointed to himself with his finger.</p> 
 <p>“Park Jin Tae, Kim Min Ah, Lee Chul Min, and Bae Puh Rum will each take care of one monster.”</p> 
 <p>That was a total of four monsters.</p> 
 <p>“And I'll take care of three of them.”</p> 
 <p>The corners of Cale’s lips started to go up.</p>
