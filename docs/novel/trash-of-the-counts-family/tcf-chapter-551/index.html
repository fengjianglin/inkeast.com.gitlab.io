 <p>Tang! Tang! Tang!</p> 
 <p>The chains fell to the ground.</p> 
 <p>The Ranger Brigade members started to stretch their bodies that felt light after finally having their chains come off.</p> 
 <p>Peek peek.</p> 
 <p>They continued to peek somewhere as they did that.</p> 
 <p>They were peeking at Deputy Chief Priest Cotton.</p> 
 <p>Flip, flip.</p> 
 <p>She was quickly flipping through the document in her hand.</p> 
 <p>Her chubby hands that were holding the document were shaking.</p> 
 <p>Tap!</p> 
 <p>She finished reading and handed the document to Solena as she turned toward Cale.</p> 
 <p>She then started to speak.</p> 
 <p>“Such crazy shit……!”<br> “Can a Deputy Chief Priest talk like that?”</p> 
 <p>Cale gently smiled. However, Cotton's gaze was fierce.</p> 
 <p>‘…He got it good.’</p> 
 <p>She wanted to grab Duke Fredo by the collar and shake him right now because of this sudden change in plans.</p> 
 <p>However, it had already happened. She had no choice but to go along with this new plan.</p> 
 <p>‘Most importantly, it’s not a bad plan.’</p> 
 <p>She looked away from Cale Henituse who had a sly expression on his face.</p> 
 <p>Cale chuckled in response and turned toward Bud.</p> 
 <p>“Let's go.”<br> “Okay.”</p> 
 <p>Bud walked toward Cale, Rosalyn, and Eruhaben.</p> 
 <p>“Leader?”</p> 
 <p>Bud smiled at the Ranger Brigade members who were looking at him in confusion.</p> 
 <p>Sniff sniff. </p> 
 <p>He sniffed with his nose like a dog.</p> 
 <p>“They need my power.”</p> 
 <p>Rosalyn walked past Bud and stood next to Glenn.</p> 
 <p>Bud pointed at Rosalyn.</p> 
 <p>“She’ll be taking my place.”</p> 
 <p>Rosalyn smiled and shook Glenn's hand.</p> 
 <p>She looked toward the Ranger Brigade members and Cale as she started to speak.</p> 
 <p>“We will finish all preparations so that we can move as soon as we get your signal.”</p> 
 <p>Cale slightly bowed toward her.</p> 
 <p>“I’ll leave it to you.”<br> “Thank you. See you later.”</p> 
 <p>Rosalyn waved her hand while Cotton's baggy priestess robe fluttered as she headed toward the entrance of the underground hideout.</p> 
 <p>“Follow me.”</p> 
 <p>She handed priest robes to the people who followed her.</p> 
 <p>“These are my trusted subordinates’ priest robes.”</p> 
 <p>There were small markings on the shoulder of those robes.</p> 
 <p>She handed them masks and hats as well as she continued to speak.</p> 
 <p>“It should be easy changing your hair colors with magic, right?”</p> 
 <p>She was talking to Cale but her gaze was focused on Eruhaben.</p> 
 <p>Eruhaben lightly snapped his fingers.</p> 
 <p>Snap!</p> 
 <p>Cale, Bud, and Eruhaben’s appearances changed with that small snap.</p> 
 <p>They all now had the common brown hair. Of course, the shades of the hairs were all different.</p> 
 <p>Cale brushed his light brown hair back and put the priest robe over his clothes.</p> 
 <p>Screeeech.</p> 
 <p>Deputy Chief Priest opened the door.</p> 
 <p>"We are heading to the Temple of the Demonic God. Follow me closely.”</p> 
 <p>The Deputy Chief Priest's true trusted subordinates were already waiting outside.</p> 
 <p>Cale, Bud, and Eruhaben headed to the center of those trusted subordinates.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go.”</p> 
 <p>Cotton took the lead and the trusted subordinates followed.</p> 
 <p>Cale, who was standing at the center of the formation, looked toward the center of Section 2.</p> 
 <p>He could see the oddly-shaped white marble temple.</p> 
 <p>That was the Temple of the Demonic God.</p> 
 <hr> 
 <p>“I, I cannot do that!”</p> 
 <p>Count Mock shook his head with a pale expression.</p> 
 <p>However, the person standing in front of him slightly tilted his head to the side.</p> 
 <p>“Are you in a position to say that you can’t do something right now?”<br> “What kind of-”<br> “You’re dead if you can't do it.”</p> 
 <p>Smile.</p> 
 <p>The lips underneath the black half-mask smiled as beautifully as a painting.</p> 
 <p>‘This crazy-!’</p> 
 <p>Count Mock glared at Informant Bob who was smiling at him.</p> 
 <p>“Ugh!”</p> 
 <p>However, he soon groaned as the rope binding him tightened.</p> 
 <p>He then heard a firm voice behind him.</p> 
 <p>“Can't we just kill him?”</p> 
 <p>Count Mock's face turned pale.</p> 
 <p>He wasn’t afraid of the Dark Elf half-blood in front of him. This bastard was unique because he could use magic, but that wasn’t a big obstacle for Mock.</p> 
 <p>However, he could not say the same for the woman behind his back right now.</p> 
 <p>“I just want to get rid of anything related to the White Star.”</p> 
 <p>The pressure she then gave off was even stronger than Dragon Fear.</p> 
 <p>Mock was sweating bullets because of this pressure that was focused solely on him.</p> 
 <p>“Hoo hoo. Count Mock, you look terrible.”</p> 
 <p>Mock started to frown at Duke Fredo who was smiling at him.</p> 
 <p>“…You damn traitor-”</p> 
 <p>Clang!</p> 
 <p>A sharp sword appeared in front of him.</p> 
 <p>“You talk too much. Just hurry up and answer whether it is possible or not.”</p> 
 <p>Choi Han’s sword was pointed at him.</p> 
 <p>‘Motherf*cker!’</p> 
 <p>Mock truly felt upset at this situation.</p> 
 <p>‘How did I, the great Mock, end up like this?!’</p> 
 <p>His insides felt like they were flipping over.</p> 
 <p>Nobody cared and the weakest but most heinous bastard pushed a document toward Mock.</p> 
 <p>“Here, that’s your script.”</p> 
 <p>Alberu gently continued to speak to Count Mock who was glaring at him.</p> 
 <p>“Just report to the White Star following the script when I give you the signal later.”<br> “…How can I lie to my liege that I conquered this Black Castle?”<br> "What's wrong? It’s not that hard.”</p> 
 <p>Mock was at a loss for words at Informant Bob's response. Alberu didn’t care as he got up and patted Count Mock's shoulder.</p> 
 <p>“You're dead if he finds out because you're so stiff like earlier. Let’s practice a lot so that you look natural. You have to do it naturally. Got it?”</p> 
 <p>Mock’s shoulders slumped down.</p> 
 <p>Alberu left him in the room and walked out with Duke Fredo and Choi Han.</p> 
 <p>It was because Lord Sheritt said that she would watch over Mock.</p> 
 <p>The three of them walked into the next room.</p> 
 <p>Raon, who was sitting in front of a video communication device, fluttered his wings as soon as they came in.</p> 
 <p>“The human hasn’t contacted us yet!”</p> 
 <p>This was the strategy room.</p> 
 <p>Alberu pointed to a seat in the strategy room next to Duke Fredo, who still thought that he was actually Bob.</p> 
 <p>“Why don’t we sit down and wait?”</p> 
 <p>Alberu, Choi Han, and Fredo all sat down inside the strategy room.</p> 
 <p>They just had to wait for Cale to contact them now.</p> 
 <hr> 
 <p>“Deputy Chief Priest-nim.”</p> 
 <p>A priest slightly bowed toward Cotton with a solemn expression.</p> 
 <p>“Please work hard a little longer as it is a tiring but happy day.”</p> 
 <p>She gently cheered on the priest whose arms were full of gifts for the citizens and entered the Temple of the Demonic God.</p> 
 <p>Her trusted subordinates were walking right behind her.</p> 
 <p>Of course, her trusted subordinates were holding gifts and other items as well.</p> 
 <p>“Ah! Deputy Chief Priest-nim! Did everything go smoothly with what you needed to do?”<br> “Of course. I brought back everything we needed.”<br> “Oh! I'm relieved!”</p> 
 <p>Every priest they passed talked to her or respectfully greeted her.</p> 
 <p>Cotton heard someone right behind her start to whisper.</p> 
 <p>“Amazing.”</p> 
 <p>Cotton quietly whispered with a smile.</p> 
 <p>“Shut the hell up.”<br> “You're quite an amazing talker, Deputy Chief Priest.”<br> “This much is good for the enemy.”</p> 
 <p>Cotton lightly responded to Cale who was following behind her while disguised as a priest.</p> 
 <p>Cale was stealthily looking around rather than looking at her.</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>The atmosphere here is not as evil as I had expected it would be.</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>He heard Eruhaben's voice in his mind. Cale nodded his head without making it look too visible.</p> 
 <p>The Temple of a Demonic God.</p> 
 <p>This place that the Chief Priest was said to take special care to maintain was pretty empty even though it was festival time.</p> 
 <p>‘Most of them are in the garden outside the building.’</p> 
 <p>The Temple of the Demonic God had set up close to a hundred long tables in the garden to treat the visiting citizens.</p> 
 <p>Sniff sniff.</p> 
 <p>He heard Bud sniffing behind him.</p> 
 <p>Cotton headed deeper into the Temple as Bud’s sniffing became more frequent.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s stop here.”</p> 
 <p>Cotton stopped walking.</p> 
 <p>“Those who are carrying things, deliver the goods to their respective locations. The rest of you come with me.”</p> 
 <p>She gave orders to her trusted subordinates and over half of them started to move elsewhere.</p> 
 <p>Cotton only took Cale's group and a few of her trusted subordinates as she walked forward again.</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>It must be over there.</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>Cale heard Eruhaben's voice and observed the large door in front of him.</p> 
 <p>A black door that did not fit this white building was blocking their way.</p> 
 <p>“Deputy Chief Priest-nim.”</p> 
 <p>Multiple priests stationed outside the door holding swords and spears recognized her.</p> 
 <p>“You are working hard even during a day like today.”<br> “Not at all. Deputy Chief Priest-nim, did you come to pray?”</p> 
 <p>Cotton nodded to the priests who were serving as the guards.</p> 
 <p>“It’s a joyous day, so I wanted to show my respects before it became busier.”<br> “I understand.”</p> 
 <p>The priests opened the door.</p> 
 <p>The door seemed to be so heavy that multiple people had to push it.</p> 
 <p>Screeeech-</p> 
 <p>The door slowly opened.</p> 
 <p>‘Ho-’</p> 
 <p>Cale barely managed to hold back his gasp.</p> 
 <p>‘What is that?’</p> 
 <p>In the large empty area…</p> 
 <p>There was a seriously heinous looking human sculpture on the high platform at the center.</p> 
 <p>“Let's go in.”</p> 
 <p>Cotton walked into the area.</p> 
 <p>Cale matched the trusted subordinates’ movements as he walked in as well.</p> 
 <p>‘…It's cold in here.’</p> 
 <p>This area was cold unlike the outside.</p> 
 <p>The air in here was colder than in the other parts of the temple. That temperature and the heinous human sculpture together gave him the chills.</p> 
 <p>Boom!</p> 
 <p>The black door closed again.</p> 
 <p>Cale turned toward the closed door. He heard Cotton’s voice at that moment.</p> 
 <p>“Nobody bothers my prayer time.”</p> 
 <p>He turned toward Cotton. Her trusted subordinates quickly walked over to the black door and stationed themselves there as she motioned with her hand.</p> 
 <p>Clang.</p> 
 <p>Of course, they took weapons out of their pockets.</p> 
 <p>“Since this place was created, the rule is that nobody opens the door while Gersey, the White Star, or I am praying in here.”</p> 
 <p>Smile. </p> 
 <p>Cotton started to smile.</p> 
 <p>“That was the only way for the White Star to progress with becoming a member of the Demonic race without any disturbances. And that is going to be advantageous for us right now.”</p> 
 <p>She finished speaking and started to head toward the sculpture.</p> 
 <p>“We are going to go underground using the hidden passage in this sculpture. Just wait a little bit.”</p> 
 <p>Cale looked at the sculpture as he waited.</p> 
 <p>Bud walked up next to him.</p> 
 <p>“Who is that?”<br> “I'm not sure either.”</p> 
 <p>Eruhaben was the one who answered.</p> 
 <p>He was looking at the sculpture as if he found it odd.</p> 
 <p>“This human's face looks extremely heinous and as if he has fallen into despair. But I cannot tell who it is.”<br> “Me neither. But it must be someone related to the White Star if he would create this sculpture.”</p> 
 <p>Bud agreed with Eruhaben's assessment before turning toward Cale.</p> 
 <p>“Do you know who that is?”</p> 
 <p>He was just asking.</p> 
 <p>“Sort of.”<br> “…What?”</p> 
 <p>Bud, Eruhaben, and Cotton all looked toward him in shock.</p> 
 <p>“You know who that is?”</p> 
 <p>Cotton was the one with the most shocked reaction. She stopped opening the passage and turned toward Cale in shock.</p> 
 <p>“When did you see him?”<br> “I have no plans on telling you, so just open the passage.”<br> “Ha……….”</p> 
 <p>Cotton started to frown as she resumed moving the device to open the passage. It seemed to require a special power to activate, as the ring on her finger was giving off some kind of power.</p> 
 <p>“Who is it?”</p> 
 <p>Cale shook his head at Eruhaben's question.</p> 
 <p>“The White Star’s face without a mask.”<br> “Ho-”</p> 
 <p>Eruhaben gasped in shock.</p> 
 <p>‘How shocking.’</p> 
 <p>Eruhaben who had been looking at the sculpture while wondering if a human being could have such a heinous expression had to look at the sculpture in a different light now.</p> 
 <p>‘What…is making the White Star have such an expression?’</p> 
 <p>He felt an odd sensation as a question filled his mind.</p> 
 <p>As the Deputy Chief Priest had mentioned…</p> 
 <p>‘How does Cale know about the White Star’s bare face?’</p> 
 <p>Eruhaben had not heard about the information Cale had gathered from Duke Fredo yet.</p> 
 <p>“He has such a vicious expression. He wouldn't look so heinous if he had a regular expression on his face.”</p> 
 <p>That was Bud's assessment of the sculpture.</p> 
 <p>As for Cale, he was looking at the sculpture of the White Star’s bare face with an odd sensation.</p> 
 <p>‘My face really looks despicable with that kind of heinous expression.’</p> 
 <p>Seeing this face on a sculpture made him really think that Kim Rok Soo and the White Star looked quite similar.</p> 
 <p>‘I need to make sure to destroy this thing.’</p> 
 <p>Kim Rok Soo never had such an expression.</p> 
 <p>Cale walked up to the sculpture with an iffy expression.</p> 
 <p>‘Did the White Star want people to worship him?’</p> 
 <p>Cale found it laughable that such a sculpture existed at the center of the Temple of the Demonic God.</p> 
 <p>It made him think that the White Star really was out of his mind.</p> 
 <p>Cale walked a little closer. He wanted to take a closer look.</p> 
 <p>Screeeeeeeech, screeeeech-</p> 
 <p>Cale saw the sculpture move up at that moment. He stopped walking and turned toward Cotton.</p> 
 <p>Cotton pointed to the passage that appeared now that the sculpture had moved up.</p> 
 <p>“I’m going in, so follow me closely.”</p> 
 <p>She walked into the passage without any hesitation.</p> 
 <p>“We need to hurry because you wasted some time with the hostages.”<br> “Isn’t it still plenty of time before one hour is up?”<br> “…Did you not look at the information Duke Fredo gave you?”<br> “I did.”</p> 
 <p>Cale responded as he walked down.</p> 
 <p>It seemed like a typical underground passage, however, it was extremely large. It was wide enough for ten adults to walk side by side.</p> 
 <p>‘Something is weird.’</p> 
 <p>The coldness he felt in the area above became even colder.</p> 
 <p>He could clearly tell that the temperature here was much lower than outside.</p> 
 <p>‘…This is weird.’</p> 
 <p>For some odd reason, it made Cale start to have an ominous feeling.</p> 
 <p>This unexplainable sense of uncertainty swept over him. It gave him the chills.</p> 
 <p>‘Why do I feel this way?’</p> 
 <p>He heard Cotton’s voice at that moment.</p> 
 <p>“As the information Duke Fredo gave you should have said, the underground facility is divided into three locations.”</p> 
 <p>She quickly walked down.</p> 
 <p>“Gersey and the White Star can go to all three places. I am only allowed in two.”</p> 
 <p>Tap. Tap.</p> 
 <p>The sound of the four people walking down echoed through the passage.</p> 
 <p>“But the most important place is the third location. The place I can't go. We must go in there and destroy it today.”<br> “What proof do you have that the third location is the most important?”</p> 
 <p>Cale asked since the reasoning was not mentioned in the information he received last time.</p> 
 <p>Why was Cotton emphasizing that the third location was the most important?</p> 
 <p>They reached the end of the staircase.</p> 
 <p>Cotton started to speak with a serious expression.</p> 
 <p>“We don't have time, so I’ll explain on our way over. I definitely have proof to back me up.”</p> 
 <p>Her eyes seemed confident that the proof she found was reliable.</p> 
 <p>“This is the first location.”</p> 
 <p>At the end of the staircase… This place looked like a naturally constructed cave.</p> 
 <p>However, the things inside were not natural.</p> 
 <p>“It is a dead mana storage facility. The White Star absorbs the dead mana here periodically.”</p> 
 <p>The numerous large beautiful glass containers were full of black liquid.</p> 
 <p>“These were all someone’s life in the past.”</p> 
 <p>Bud had a bitter expression on his face.</p> 
 <p>However, Cale calmly counted the number of glass containers as he started to speak.</p> 
 <p>“We should move all these black liquids elsewhere.”<br> “Looks like I need to step in.”</p> 
 <p>Eruhaben walked toward the glass containers.</p> 
 <p>“Please.”<br> “It’s easy.”</p> 
 <p>Eruhaben said it was easy, but it was actually difficult. There were quite a lot of them.</p> 
 <p>Shh. </p> 
 <p>Eruhaben put his hand on one of the glass containers.</p> 
 <p>It was at that moment.</p> 
 <p>Beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep- beeeeeeeeeeeeeep-</p> 
 <p>A sharp noise echoed around them.</p> 
 <p>“…Shit!”</p> 
 <p>Cotton turned pale.</p> 
 <p>“They found us!”<br> “What?”</p> 
 <p>Cale walked over to her in shock.</p> 
 <p>Cotton took an orb out of her pocket.</p> 
 <p>“This is the signal my trusted subordinates were to send if they were caught! Who is it? Who found us? It’s not the White Star!”</p> 
 <p>She looked at Cale and urgently continued to speak.</p> 
 <p>“Gersey! I'm sure Gersey is the one who found us! My trusted subordinate would not have been able to send me a signal if it was the White Star! They’d be dead long before they could do that!”</p> 
 <p>She bit down on her lips.</p> 
 <p>“Why? Gersey was supposed to come an hour later, so why did he come here earlier? He’s kept this rule for many years, so what changed?”</p> 
 <p>Her eyes looked chaotic.</p> 
 <p>Beeeeeep- Beeeeeeep-</p> 
 <p>The alarm started to get louder.</p> 
 <p>Bud who was watching this walked over to Cale in shock.</p> 
 <p>"Hey, what do we do?”</p> 
 <p>It was at that moment.</p> 
 <p>Crack!</p> 
 <p>Cracks were starting to appear on the orb.</p> 
 <p>“Damn it!”</p> 
 <p>Cotton threw the orb into the air.</p> 
 <p>Baaaaaang!</p> 
 <p>The orb then exploded.</p> 
 <p>“…This orb is connected by the power of those who serve the Demonic race. Only another priest could destroy it.”</p> 
 <p>Cotton's eyes filled with fear and urgency.</p> 
 <p>“I’m certain. Gersey has found us.”</p> 
 <p>She looked at Cale.</p> 
 <p>“He will chase after us.”</p>
