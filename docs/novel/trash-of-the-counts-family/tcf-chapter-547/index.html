 <p>Count Mock who had been heading toward the forest turned around before leaving with Squad 4.</p> 
 <p>“Vice Commander!”<br> “Yes, Commander-nim!”<br> “You lead Squad 3.”<br> “Please leave it to me.”</p> 
 <p>Squad 3 consisted of Cale, the Vampire warriors, and the Vampire Knights.</p> 
 <p>“Guide!”</p> 
 <p>Alberu walked up to Count Mock and handed him four maps at his calling.<br> Mock handed those maps to the squad leaders leading the squads heading to the north, east, and west.</p> 
 <p>“Everybody remembers the details of the plan?”<br> “Yes, sir!”<br> “Yes, sir!”</p> 
 <p>Count Mock made eye contact with each person responsible for a squad before saying one thing.</p> 
 <p>“Vice Commander.”</p> 
 <p>Cale raised his hand at Mock's calling.</p> 
 <p>Three nimble-looking Vampires stepped forward.<br> Mock looked over them before nodding his head.</p> 
 <p>"They are informants and people who have each been to the Forest of Darkness at least once.”</p> 
 <p>He motioned with his hand and the three Vampires moved so that one of them was with Squad Leaders 1, 2, and 3.<br> Alberu moved next to Count Mock and Squad 4 at the same time.</p> 
 <p>Mock finally turned back around.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go.”</p> 
 <p>Squad 4 that was made of Dark Elves headed toward the south side of the Black Castle.</p> 
 <p>“We will be on our way, sir.”<br> “See you soon, Commander.”</p> 
 <p>The noble awaiters who were serving as Squad Leaders for Squads 1 and 2 showed the map to their respective Vampire informants and quickly started to move as well.</p> 
 <p>“Time for us to go too.”</p> 
 <p>Squad 3 that Cale was leading started to move toward the west side of the Black Castle as well.</p> 
 <p>Cale made eye contact with Alberu Crossman who turned around and looked at him before he left.</p> 
 <p>‘See you in a bit.’<br> ‘Yes, your highness.’</p> 
 <p>The two of them communicated with a short eye greeting.</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li>I'll look after Alberu Crossman too.</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>Cale nodded his head after hearing Eruhaben’s voice and started to move toward the west side of the Black Castle.</p> 
 <p>Shhhhhhh- shhhhhhh-</p> 
 <p>Squad 3 started to move while matching Naru’s movements.</p> 
 <p>“Everybody should have started moving by now.”</p> 
 <p>Cale changed directions as soon as he heard Solena's voice.</p> 
 <p>“We are heading north.”</p> 
 <p>He was going back the way he came even though his Squad 3 was responsible for the west side.</p> 
 <p>Swiiiiiish- Swiiiiiiiish-</p> 
 <p>His ancient powers had been hidden thanks to Fredo's armband, but the Sound of the Wind now swirled at the tip of his feet.<br> Although this power did not suit young master Naru-nim, no Vampires questioned this right now.</p> 
 <p>Shhhhhhhhhhhhhh-</p> 
 <p>The Vampires silently followed behind Cale.<br> The slightly over 100 Vampires all headed north.<br> Cale served as their guide in the front.</p> 
 <p>Shhhhh- shhhhhhh-</p> 
 <p>They brushed past branches and bushes and immediately turned north once they returned to the place they had teleported to.</p> 
 <p>Cale started to speak once they were following behind Squad 1.</p> 
 <p>“Come out.”</p> 
 <p>Shhh.</p> 
 <p>One of the large trees started to shake.</p> 
 <p>Boom!</p> 
 <p>Cale turned his head after hearing a loud noise.</p> 
 <p>“Welcome, young master-nim.”</p> 
 <p>Tiger shaman Gashan welcomed him.</p> 
 <p>Crunch. Crunch.</p> 
 <p>The large Tiger warriors slowly raised their heads from the shadows of the trees along with the sound of crunching leaves.</p> 
 <p>‘Mm!’</p> 
 <p>Solena had heard about this, but her hands still became sweaty after looking into the eyes of the Tiger warriors who had been hiding.</p> 
 <p>‘It's starting now.’</p> 
 <p>She tensed up after realizing that the true plan was starting.<br> She was excited as well.</p> 
 <p>Cale started to speak.</p> 
 <p>“The Dark Elves’ Elementals have headed south with Squad 4.”</p> 
 <p>The Elementals that Count Mock's subordinates controlled…<br> Those Elementals were said to eat other Elementals.</p> 
 <p>“So this is our chance.”</p> 
 <p>The golden top's whip was in Cale's hand.</p> 
 <p>‘Just tell me what to do. Chaos, destruction, happiness.’<br> ‘It’s been a while! I've been so bored ever since you told me to wait in the Forest of Darkness!’<br> ‘Sigh. It was so hard hiding from the Dark Elves’ Elementals.’</p> 
 <p>Caw. Caw.</p> 
 <p>Cale lifted his head.</p> 
 <p>The three Wind Elementals and the crows started to appear one or two at a time and started to cover the sky above the Forest of Darkness.</p> 
 <p>Cale opened his mouth to speak.</p> 
 <p>“The operation name is ‘Hunt.’ ”</p> 
 <p>He ordered the first step of the operation.</p> 
 <p>“We will capture Squad 1 first.”</p> 
 <p>Squad 1's leader was swordsman Andrei who was said to be one of the strongest of the noble awaiters.</p> 
 <p>“Move.”</p> 
 <p>The Vampires and Tigers started to move north.<br> Their movements were swift but stealthy.</p> 
 <p>Squad 3 started to chase behind Squad 1.</p> 
 <hr> 
 <p>Squad 1's leader, swordsman Andrei.</p> 
 <p>"Squad leader-nim, it is to the left.”<br> “Okay.”</p> 
 <p>He followed the Vampire informant and turned left with a faint smile on his face.</p> 
 <p>‘Soon!’</p> 
 <p>He was one of the top noble awaiters.</p> 
 <p>He was lacking in comparison to the original nobles, but he was skilled enough to be able to receive the best treatment if he had gone to any other organization.<br> This was because he was a sword master.</p> 
 <p>Ooooooooong-</p> 
 <p>His sword started to vibrate.<br> A faint aura smoke started to appear.</p> 
 <p>“Congratulations.”</p> 
 <p>He looked back for a moment after hearing a voice right behind him.<br> Another noble awaiter was smiling as he sucked up to him.</p> 
 <p>“What do you mean?”</p> 
 <p>Andrei looked stern as if to ask the person who spoke what they were talking about in the middle of the plan.<br> The person who spoke smiled even brighter after seeing his expression.</p> 
 <p>"Aw come on, you know exactly what I mean, sir.”<br> “Ahem.”</p> 
 <p>Andrei let out a fake cough and turned around.</p> 
 <p>“…Please keep the useless chatter for later.”<br> “I'm only saying it because we are on our own now.”</p> 
 <p>Andrei peeked toward the Vampire informant after hearing that. It was his way of telling the other person that they were not ‘on our own,’ with this Vampire here.</p> 
 <p>“Ah.”</p> 
 <p>The other noble awaiter finally closed his mouth.<br> However, he still smiled wickedly toward Andrei.</p> 
 <p>He was not the only one.<br> Andrei's subordinates, as well as the 24 noble awaiters who made up his squad, all had bright expressions.</p> 
 <p>‘Hehe. It’s not like I don’t understand why he feels that way.’</p> 
 <p>Andrei understood the other awaiter quite well.</p> 
 <p>The Black Castle destruction plan.<br> The plan was to destroy the castle while Cale Henituse and his core group of friends were not around and take the people inside as hostages.</p> 
 <p>‘It won't be easy.’</p> 
 <p>Even without Cale Henituse and the core individuals, the chances that Cale Henituse left the castle empty because there were enough defenses set up were high.<br> That was why he thought that the difficulty of the plan would be considered high between high, medium, and low.</p> 
 <p>‘But it is not so dangerous that I might die.’</p> 
 <p>That was what was making the members of Squad 1 all have bright expressions.<br> This was especially true for Andrei, who was full of anticipation.</p> 
 <p>If this plan was a success…</p> 
 <p>‘I should receive a noble title if we succeed.’</p> 
 <p>He was a squad leader after all.<br> He had to temporarily become Count Mock's subordinate because of it, but he wasn’t planning on quietly staying there.</p> 
 <p>Andrei composed his expression and started to speak.</p> 
 <p>“Everybody focus!”<br> “Yes, sir!”</p> 
 <p>He then gave an order to the informant.</p> 
 <p>“We are increasing our speed.”</p> 
 <p>He was planning on quickly getting to the discussed location and surrounding the Black Castle.</p> 
 <p>Andrei's desires were almost overflowing.</p> 
 <p>“Yes, sir. I will increase my speed!”</p> 
 <p>The informant quickly moved with the map in his hand.<br> Andrei followed behind him as well.</p> 
 <p>“Ugh!”</p> 
 <p>The informant's body suddenly fell forward at that moment.</p> 
 <p>"What is it?”</p> 
 <p>Andrei looked toward the informant in shock.</p> 
 <p>“M, my foot-!”</p> 
 <p>The informant reached for his ankle with a shocked expression.</p> 
 <p>“…Huh?”</p> 
 <p>Andrei’s eyes opened wide.</p> 
 <p>He saw a gold rope that shot out of the ground and grabbed the Vampire informant’s ankle.</p> 
 <p>"A rope?”</p> 
 <p>‘Is this one of Cale Henituse's traps?’</p> 
 <p>His back suddenly turned cold as he had that thought.</p> 
 <p>‘No.’</p> 
 <p>He felt as if something was clenching him from all directions.<br> That was why he realized it.</p> 
 <p>‘This is not just a simple trap!’</p> 
 <p>He turned away from the Vampire who was still on the ground clenching his ankle.</p> 
 <p>He happened to see something land on his arm at that moment.<br> Andrei had been quickly charging forward until now. That was why he had not noticed it earlier.</p> 
 <p>That thing had landed on the back of his hand silently and so gently that he didn't even feel it.</p> 
 <p>“…Powder?”</p> 
 <p>Gold powder was surrounding him and the rest of Squad 1.<br> The amount of powder started to exponentially increase.</p> 
 <p>‘This is dangerous! I can tell that this is very dangerous!’</p> 
 <p>Andrei shouted as soon as he felt that way.</p> 
 <p>“…Dodge! Step back!”</p> 
 <p>He tried to move back as he shouted.</p> 
 <p>The gold powder.<br> He couldn’t tell what it was, but his intuition as someone who just barely made it past the hump to become a sword master was telling him that this was a dangerous situation.</p> 
 <p>But it was already too late.</p> 
 <p>“Ugh!”<br> “Ugh! My body!”<br> “Ahhh!”</p> 
 <p>The powder instantly gathered together and increased in size.<br> It then started to bind the bodies of Squad 1's members.</p> 
 <p>“N, no!”<br> “I can’t move my body!”</p> 
 <p>The shining golden rope was too strong to be a regular rope.<br> It was hard for them to even twist their bodies.</p> 
 <p>“Ugh! How is this so strong?!”</p> 
 <p>Andrei's body had been bound before he could even take out his sword.<br> It was so quick that he couldn't even dodge.</p> 
 <p>‘Is it a trap?’</p> 
 <p>That was not it.<br> He quickly got rid of the thought that these ropes were traps that Cale had left behind.</p> 
 <p>‘This is someone attacking us.’</p> 
 <p>This power had accurately aimed for all of them.<br> That was only possible if someone was looking at them right now.</p> 
 <p>There was also something else he realized.</p> 
 <p>‘This person is strong.’</p> 
 <p>He was able to become the squad leader because he was a sword master, but most of Squad 1's members were quite strong as well.<br> There were mages in the group too, but this enemy had tricked all of them and had instantly suppressed them.</p> 
 <p>Andrei started to sweat.<br> He held back his fear and raised his voice.</p> 
 <p>“Who are you?! Who dares to ambush us like this?!”</p> 
 <p>He looked around and raised his voice.<br> His hand was doing everything it could to get free and reach for his scabbard.</p> 
 <p>‘If I can just get my sword out!’ </p> 
 <p>He could just slash away this stupid rope with his aura if he could pull his sword out.</p> 
 <p>It was at that moment.</p> 
 <p>“Where are you looking?”</p> 
 <p>Andrei heard a foreign voice.</p> 
 <p>“You should raise your head.”</p> 
 <p>Flinch.</p> 
 <p>Andrei's shoulders flinched before he looked up.</p> 
 <p>He could see an Elf sitting on top of a thick branch on a tree.<br> The beautiful Elf with white-gold hair started to smile.</p> 
 <p>“You wish to return alive after stepping into a Dragon’s lair?”</p> 
 <p>‘What? A Dragon’s lair?’</p> 
 <p>Andrei was definitely looking at an Elf, but his whole body felt chilly after looking into the Elf’s eyes.</p> 
 <p>It was at that moment.</p> 
 <p>“Hmm. How disappointing.”</p> 
 <p>He heard a voice behind him.<br> Andrei slowly raised his head.</p> 
 <p>It was a familiar voice.</p> 
 <p>‘Whose voice is this?’</p> 
 <p>He soon remembered the owner of this voice.<br> He was confused because the way the person was speaking was completely different than normal, but he remembered.</p> 
 <p>‘…Young master Naru Von Ejellan!’</p> 
 <p>They were allies.</p> 
 <p>His head that had been slowly turning quickly turned in joy about seeing an ally before he could even question why Naru was here.<br> Naru was smiling and approaching him.</p> 
 <p>He opened his mouth to speak.<br> He didn't sound like the pure and brave boy who just wanted to get revenge for his father. It was a cold voice that reached Andrei's ear.</p> 
 <p>“This is very disappointing.”</p> 
 <p>Naru was disappointed.<br> The boy's gaze headed toward the white-gold haired Elf sitting on the tree branch.</p> 
 <p>“How can you attack first like that, sir?”</p> 
 <p>‘…What?’</p> 
 <p>Andrei's questioned his ears for a moment.<br> However, that suspicion soon returned with a clear answer.</p> 
 <p>Naru looked at him and started to smile.</p> 
 <p>“I was supposed to get him first.”</p> 
 <p>Grrrrr-</p> 
 <p>Squad 1 quickly heard the roars of wild beasts surrounding them.</p> 
 <p>Crunch. Crunch.</p> 
 <p>However, the things that came out through the bushes were the Beast men of the Tiger tribe who were much scarier than wild beasts.<br> Berserk Tigers completely surrounded them.</p> 
 <p>“What the hell!”</p> 
 <p>Andrei looked back and Naru and started to shout.</p> 
 <p>“Young master Naru! What the hell are you doing? Did you betray us?”</p> 
 <p>However, Naru did not respond.<br> Someone else responded in his place.</p> 
 <p>“Betray? How can you say such upsetting things?”<br> “…Who are you?!”</p> 
 <p>One of the Vampire knights who had been standing behind Cale walked forward.<br> The Vampires bowed their heads and made a path for him.</p> 
 <p>The knight removed the helmet on his head.</p> 
 <p>“You should know my face, right?”</p> 
 <p>“Uhh, uhh!”</p> 
 <p>Andrei could not continue speaking because he was shocked.</p> 
 <p>“H, how are you here?!”</p>
