 <p>“October 25th, 11am.”</p> 
 <p>Cale quietly watched Lee Seung Won who was peeking at him while speaking.</p> 
 <p>“Keep going.”</p> 
 <p>Lee Seung Won hesitated before responding to Cale.</p> 
 <p>“Hyung, will this really be useful?”</p> 
 <p>Cale looked up after seeing the uncertainty in Lee Seung Won’s eyes.</p> 
 <p>He could see the clear sky.</p> 
 <p>He was currently on the roof of the central shelter building.</p> 
 <p>‘Cale-nim.’</p> 
 <p>Cale recalled the conversation he had with Choi Han last night.</p> 
 <p>‘What is it?’<br> ‘The God of Death said this in passing… But either way, this is what he said.’</p> 
 <p>Choi Han had wondered if it was important, but he still said it as if it was nothing.</p> 
 <p>‘The sealed god is not able to return to the past, but he is able to push his way into a different dimension.’</p> 
 <p>Choi Han then shrugged his shoulders, saying that was it.</p> 
 <p>Cale, who had been extremely busy since last night, was finally able to think about it now that he had some time.</p> 
 <p>‘He's able to open a path into a different dimension?’</p> 
 <p>Did that mean that this place was not a test created with his past as the background?</p> 
 <p>“…Could this be a different place?”</p> 
 <p>Or was it just an illusion created for his test?</p> 
 <p>“Rok Soo hyung.”</p> 
 <p>Cale turned his gaze.</p> 
 <p>"Can I ask you what you mean by that?”</p> 
 <p>Cale shrugged his shoulders at Choi Han's question.</p> 
 <p>“Hmm? Oh, nothing much. I was just thinking about the dimension thing you mentioned last night.”</p> 
 <p>“Ah.”</p> 
 <p>Choi Han instantly understood what Cale was thinking.</p> 
 <p>“Are you thinking that a different dimension-”</p> 
 <p>He peeked at Lee Seung Won for a moment before shutting up.</p> 
 <p>Lee Seung Won was looking at Choi Han with interest.</p> 
 <p>‘He said that he was Rok Soo hyung’s close dongsaeng?’</p> 
 <p>They were said to be like blood siblings.</p> 
 <p>‘He’s the same age as me.’</p> 
 <p>They were the same age, but Lee Seung Won found it difficult to speak to Choi Han for some reason.</p> 
 <p>Choi Han also stayed next to Rok Soo hyung and did not try to chat with the others.</p> 
 <p>Cale nodded his head at Choi Han who had stopped speaking after peeking at Lee Seung Won.</p> 
 <p>“Yes, I'm just thinking about that statement.”<br> “But I came into your consci-, mm, anyway, that was the condition.”</p> 
 <p>Since Choi Han had come into Cale's consciousness, he didn't think it was a different dimension or anything like that.</p> 
 <p>“I'm not sure.”</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, Cale didn’t trust either the God of Death nor the sealed god.</p> 
 <p>Gods. He had never seen them lie, but he had seen them not tell the entire truth many times.</p> 
 <p>‘Either way, whether this world is an illusion or a test or whatever…’</p> 
 <p>He was going to treat it as if it was real.</p> 
 <p>Cale had already made up his mind.</p> 
 <p>He looked toward Lee Seung Won and started to speak.</p> 
 <p>“You asked if this will be useful?”</p> 
 <p>That was the question Lee Seung Won had asked Cale just now.</p> 
 <p>‘Hyung, will this really be useful?’</p> 
 <p>Lee Seung Won cautiously nodded his head.</p> 
 <p>“…Yes. Do you think it’ll be useful?”</p> 
 <p>Cale nodded his head at the question.</p> 
 <p>“It’ll be useful.”</p> 
 <p>The more that this world was real to Kim Rok Soo and Cale Henituse…</p> 
 <p>Lee Seung Won’s ability was necessary.</p> 
 <p>It didn’t matter whether this world was an illusion or a test.</p> 
 <p>He needed to create a future for them.</p> 
 <p>He needed to give them hope.</p> 
 <p>Wouldn't that be the best way to get rid of his despair?</p> 
 <p>If getting rid of Cale’s, or actually, Kim Rok Soo's despair was the conditions for passing this test…</p> 
 <p>That made it more important for Cale to create a future for them.</p> 
 <p>That way he could… Wash away the despair he had for not just this one moment, but the future that would come.</p> 
 <p>“I told you, right?”</p> 
 <p>He put his hand on the shoulder of Lee Seung Won, the boy who was only three years younger than him in this place.</p> 
 <p>“Data is the future. Even weak humans are able to defeat a monster if they know its weakness. Being able to think. That is the greatest strength humans have.”</p> 
 <p>Lee Seung Won’s ability.</p> 
 <p>‘Recording.’</p> 
 <p>Cale looked at the small badge in Lee Seung Won’s hand.</p> 
 <p>It was a random badge that had been rolling around inside the building.</p> 
 <p>“Seung Won. The information you create with your abilities will become the hope for this world.”<br> “…To survive-”<br> “You’re saying that it’s a useless power for survival?”</p> 
 <p>Lee Seung Won nodded his head and quietly responded to Cale who cut him off and asked.</p> 
 <p>“…Yeah.”<br> “There’s no such thing.”</p> 
 <p>Cale disagreed with Lee Seung Won without any hesitation.</p> 
 <p>There were no abilities that were useless for survival.</p> 
 <p>They needed every ability.</p> 
 <p>However, it was just the difference of whether it was needed now or for the future.</p> 
 <p>Cale looked down from the roof.</p> 
 <p>Lee Seung Won also looked down at the ground as well.</p> 
 <p>They were looking at the area inside the boundaries where monsters did not come.</p> 
 <p>Lee Seung Won took in all of it.</p> 
 <p>More people than ever were standing inside the boundaries.</p> 
 <p>He could feel the rowdiness inside the building right now.</p> 
 <p>Lee Seung Won heard Cale’s whisper.</p> 
 <p>“Seung Won. Take a good look at today's battles.”</p> 
 <p>That whisper was very confident as if he was telling the truth.</p> 
 <p>“You'll see how even people without abilities can fight and win.”</p> 
 <p>Lee Seung Won looked back toward Cale.</p> 
 <p>Cale was standing up at that moment.</p> 
 <p>Screeeech.</p> 
 <p>Cale looked toward Park Jin Tae who had opened the door to the roof and was walking in.</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae was with Lee Chul Min as they walked over to Cale.</p> 
 <p>He opened his mouth to speak.</p> 
 <p>“I delivered your message to the other central shelters. We went to more temporary shelters as well.”<br> “Didn’t they call you crazy?”<br> “Pfft.” </p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae chuckled.</p> 
 <p>“Of course they did. Who wouldn’t? We were telling them that all of the shelters would be destroyed and that monsters will come charging in.”</p> 
 <p>From last night until this morning…</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae and a few others had urgently gathered teams to go visit the two central shelters close to this one.</p> 
 <p>They also stopped by the temporary shelters they knew of along the way as well.</p> 
 <p>They had informed all of those shelters about the things Kim Rok Soo had told Park Jin Tae.</p> 
 <p>They also handed them the things Kim Rok Soo told them to deliver.</p> 
 <p>“We also brought the people who believed us back, just as you wanted.”</p> 
 <p>One corner of Cale's lips went up after hearing Park Jin Tae’s comment.</p> 
 <p>“Was it just because I wanted it? Didn’t you bring them because you wanted to save them? Isn’t that why you kept doing it all morning even though it was supposed to end at dawn?”</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae had been busy since last night and all morning today bringing people over from many places.</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae avoided Cale's smile.</p> 
 <p>“…Don't speak such nonsense.”</p> 
 <p>Smirk.</p> 
 <p>Cale smiled once more and Park Jin Tae started to frown as he started to speak again.</p> 
 <p>“I handed out all of our food except for one day's worth.”</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae did not give out all of the food they had gathered during the hunts.</p> 
 <p>They always put aside a portion of the food with long expiration dates.</p> 
 <p>They did it for the days that they couldn't hunt.</p> 
 <p>But he had given out a majority of their reserves today.</p> 
 <p>“Everybody must have eaten until they were full.”<br> “Yes. That’s the only way for them to be able to deal with your plan.”</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae took a step toward Cale. He then started to speak in a concerned tone.</p> 
 <p>“We will starve in one day if you lied.”</p> 
 <p>Cale's calm eyes looked toward Park Jin Tae.</p> 
 <p>“Do you not believe me?”</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae looked past Cale and at Choi Han.</p> 
 <p>He then looked at Lee Seung Won as well.</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae then started to speak again.</p> 
 <p>“…I haven't seen any monsters nearby since last night. It’s quiet even when we are out past the boundary. It looks as if the monsters are hiding from the humans.”<br> “It’s the calm before the storm.”</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae nodded his head.</p> 
 <p>“I don’t have foresight, but I do have my intuition. It seemed as if there would be a storm soon.”</p> 
 <p>Lee Chul Min had a stiff expression while standing behind Park Jin Tae as well.</p> 
 <p>He seemed to have felt the eerie fear surrounding them as well.</p> 
 <p>“Grandma Kim told me to give you a message. She said that the things you asked for are all prepared.”<br> “Then I guess I should go down now.”</p> 
 <p>Cale headed toward the door.</p> 
 <p>He then headed down.</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae and Choi Han were right behind him.</p> 
 <p>Lee Seung Won watched them for a moment before starting to speak.</p> 
 <p>“The current time is 11:45 am on October 25th.”</p> 
 <p>His voice sounded slightly anxious.</p> 
 <p>“All central shelters will be destroyed at 12:01 pm. The temporary shelters will slowly be destroyed as well. The monsters will continuously attack for 24 hours.”</p> 
 <p>Lee Seung Won closed his eyes for a moment before opening them back.</p> 
 <p>“However.”</p> 
 <p>Lee Seung Won's voice started to sound more energetic.</p> 
 <p>“A new central shelter will soon appear.”</p> 
 <p>His voice was being recorded.</p> 
 <p>“We plan on heading there.”</p> 
 <p>Lee Seung Won hesitated before continuing to speak.</p> 
 <p>“Kim Rok Soo has prophesized all of this and I, Lee Seung Won, believe everything he said. We will now start the first record.”</p> 
 <p>Lee Seung Won clenched the badge and headed down from the roof.</p> 
 <p>It was so that he could follow behind Kim Rok Soo.</p> 
 <p>‘Hmm.’</p> 
 <p>Cale looked around as he headed to the bottom of the building.</p> 
 <p>He could feel the whispers and anxious gazes being focused on him.</p> 
 <p>It was not very loud inside the building because everybody was speaking quietly.</p> 
 <p>That made people even more anxious.</p> 
 <p>But Cale's eyes were looking at something else instead of that anxiety.</p> 
 <p>‘We did as much as we could.’</p> 
 <p>It was only one day, but there were many things prepared throughout the building that Cale had asked for.</p> 
 <p>“Hey, Rok Soo.”<br> “Grandma.”</p> 
 <p>Grandma Kim was in charge of everything inside the building while Park Jin Tae was going to the nearby shelters last night.</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae told people that he was leaving everything to her, so everything was able to quickly proceed as Grandma Kim had a good reputation with everyone.</p> 
 <p>Cale headed for the main door on the first floor.</p> 
 <p>“Mister.”</p> 
 <p>Jang Man Soo who was sitting on a chair near the door waved at him.</p> 
 <p>“Here. Take this.”</p> 
 <p>He took the item Jang Man Soo handed him.</p> 
 <p>It was a watch.</p> 
 <p>It was one of the few devices that still worked.</p> 
 <p>Tick tock.</p> 
 <p>Time was flowing by.</p> 
 <p>A lot of time had passed as he slowly came down while looking around.</p> 
 <p>The current time was 11:55 am.</p> 
 <p>Cale opened his mouth to speak.</p> 
 <p>“Choi Han, move the mister.”<br> “Yes, hyung-nim.”</p> 
 <p>Jang Man Soo got on Choi Han’s back.</p> 
 <p>Cale headed out the door.</p> 
 <p>In the open area outside the building… There were many ability users gathered in this area inside the boundaries of the central shelter.</p> 
 <p>They were looking at Cale with anxiety, distrust, confusion, and all sorts of other emotions.</p> 
 <p>Cale walked past them toward the edge of the boundary.</p> 
 <p>“You're here?”</p> 
 <p>Lee Seung Won's older sister, Lee Jin Joo, awkwardly smiled and greeted him.</p> 
 <p>“Is this my spot?”<br> “Yes, sir. Choi Han, put the mister down.”</p> 
 <p>Jang Man Soo was now next to Cale. He had been lowered right in front of the boundary.</p> 
 <p>He felt the soft blanket under him as he looked up at Cale.</p> 
 <p>‘…I didn't know he had this side to him.’</p> 
 <p>He was looking at Kim Rok Soo, who was standing up straight despite the anxious, fearful, distrusting, and angry gazes focused on him, in amazement.</p> 
 <p>Cale started to speak at that moment.</p> 
 <p>“There's 1 minute left.”</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae quickly raised his voice.</p> 
 <p>“Everybody, get to your stations!”</p> 
 <p>People quickly moved to their stations at Park Jin Tae's order.</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae could see some distrusting gazes as he watched them move.</p> 
 <p>‘You trust what Kim Rok Soo said?’<br> ‘What the hell are we doing so early in the day?’</p> 
 <p>That was what their gazes were saying.</p> 
 <p>Those were the grumbles and questions directed toward Park Jin Tae, the leader of this central shelter, who had been moving around because of Kim Rok Soo since last night.</p> 
 <p>‘This is driving me nuts.’</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae was actually feeling the same way.</p> 
 <p>He wondered if they really should be doing this.</p> 
 <p>However, he decided to wait as well since he said he would trust Rok Soo.</p> 
 <p>Soon.</p> 
 <p>The moment Kim Rok Soo described would be here soon.</p> 
 <p>They heard Kim Rok Soo’s nonchalant voice at that moment.</p> 
 <p>“3.”</p> 
 <p>The sun was still bright and the sky was clear.</p> 
 <p>“2.”</p> 
 <p>Everybody inside the central shelter looked up at the sky.</p> 
 <p>Their hearts were beating wildly.</p> 
 <p>“1.”</p> 
 <p>And at that moment…</p> 
 <p>The world turned dark.</p> 
 <p>Everybody felt as if they were losing strength in their arms and legs.</p> 
 <p>Their bodies felt as if they were going cold.</p> 
 <p>It was because they could imagine the terrible nightmare that was to start.</p> 
 <p>‘Kim Rok Soo was right!’</p> 
 <p>From inside the darkness…</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae started to frown in this world where he could not see anything.</p> 
 <p>It was at that moment.</p> 
 <p>“Noona!”</p> 
 <p>He could hear Kim Rok Soo's voice through the darkness.</p> 
 <p>He was calling for Lee Jin Joo.</p> 
 <p>“Noona! Speak as loudly as you can!”</p> 
 <p>Cale put his hand on Lee Jin Joo's shoulder as she was curled up in fear from the darkness.</p> 
 <p>Maybe it was because of his body heat…</p> 
 <p>Lee Jin Joo started to speak.</p> 
 <p>{This is a message from the Park Jin Tae shelter.}</p> 
 <p>She had supposedly majored in Music.</p> 
 <p>Maybe that was the reason.</p> 
 <p>{Last night, or maybe early today. You should have received information from the Park Jin Tae shelter.}</p> 
 <p>Her voice echoed through the dark world.</p> 
 <p>Her ability was ‘amplification.’</p> 
 <p>Her voice was loud enough to reach the nearby shelters and the other two central shelters.</p> 
 <p>Normally, she would not use her ability as it would draw monsters to them, but it was different if the monsters were going to come anyway.</p> 
 <p>{Please use that information to persist.}</p> 
 <p>To the people in the other shelters who had not believed Cale’s words that Park Jin Tae had delivered to them…</p> 
 <p>Her voice would be like a lighthouse.</p> 
 <p>{As mentioned in the information we delivered, a new central shelter will appear.}</p> 
 <p>The new central shelters would be the size of 3 - 5 current central shelters combined.</p> 
 <p>‘But that means that 3 - 5 of the original central shelters will disappear.’</p> 
 <p>3 - 5 of the original central shelters would disappear and a large central shelter would take their place.</p> 
 <p>She continued to speak.</p> 
 <p>{You will hear my voice once every hour.}</p> 
 <p>It was about time for that voice to stop talking for a moment.</p> 
 <p>{I hope to see you all at the new central shelter. Let's all survive together.}</p> 
 <p>Cale who was listening to the ticking of the watch that still had batteries started to speak.</p> 
 <p>“10 seconds.”</p> 
 <p>‘9, 8, …. 5, 4.’</p> 
 <p>{Good luck.}</p> 
 <p>As Lee Jin Joo's first amplification came to an end…</p> 
 <p>‘3, 2.’</p> 
 <p>“1 second.”</p> 
 <p>The world brightened up again.</p> 
 <p>“Ho!”</p> 
 <p>Step.</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae subconsciously took a step back.</p> 
 <p>He had the chills.</p> 
 <p>Intense pressure was bearing down on him from all sides.</p> 
 <p>He felt as if he was going to be suffocated to death from the pressure.</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae stopped walking back after looking out in front of him.</p> 
 <p>“…F*ck……”</p> 
 <p>He could not see the end.</p> 
 <p>There were so many Grade 3 monsters that Kim Rok Soo mentioned moving toward them that he couldn't see the end.</p> 
 <p>The Grade 2 and Grade 1 monsters would be waiting their turn behind them.</p> 
 <p>“…My goodness! I, it really-!”</p> 
 <p>Park Jin Tae could hear Lee Chul Min's astonished voice.</p> 
 <p>Everybody couldn’t help but feel fear and despair at the reality of the situation.</p> 
 <p>They had prayed that it wouldn’t happen, but this nightmare, no, this real situation, was suffocating them.</p> 
 <p>They heard a sharp voice at that moment.</p> 
 <p>"Everybody snap out of it!”</p> 
 <p>Everybody turned toward Cale who was standing right in front of the boundary.</p> 
 <p>They were all looking at his back.</p> 
 <p>Cale had not even turned around.</p> 
 <p>But he needed to do something about the people who were afraid of the reality of the situation.</p> 
 <p>He needed to tell them they didn’t need to be afraid.</p> 
 <p>“Choi Han!”</p> 
 <p>Cale and Choi Han made eye contact.</p> 
 <p>“Sweep them away!”</p> 
 <p>Choi Han started to run toward the Grade 3 monsters charging toward them.</p>
