 <p>The northern part of the Eastern continent.<br>There was a mountain range here that blocked the cold air that came down all year long from the tip of the northern region that was covered in ice.</p>
 <p>“…F*ck.”</p>
 <p>The Mercenary King who was climbing the tallest mountain in that mountain range could not help but swear.</p>
 <p>The White Star’s second secret base would appear once they climbed over this mountain.<br>So, why were they walking so slowly?</p>
 <p>Bud Illis was slowly climbing the mountain at a speed that he thought was too slow.<br>An Elf walked up next to him and started to speak.</p>
 <p>“Please be patient.”<br>“…I need to be patient, but it is frustrating.”</p>
 <p>It was at that moment.</p>
 <p>Shaaaaaaaaaaa-</p>
 <p>A light breeze brushed past him.</p>
 <p>Both Bud and the Elf next to him stopped moving.<br>The breeze stopped next to the Elf.</p>
 <p>“The thirty-first message.”</p>
 <p>Swooooooosh-</p>
 <p>The Wind Elemental delivered a message to its contracted Elf. The Elf then immediately relayed the message to Bud.</p>
 <p>“Squad leader Sorros in the west. No abnormalities discovered. No life forms discovered.”</p>
 <p>The Elf raised his hand.</p>
 <p>Rustle. Rustle.</p>
 <p>Leaves fluttered in the air. Bud observed what was going on.<br>There were still a lot of trees around them as they had not reached the snowy portions.<br>Numerous pairs of eyes started to appear and look at Bud.</p>
 <p>Blink.</p>
 <p>As all pairs of eyes blinked once…<br>The Elf next to Bud started to speak.</p>
 <p>"Everything seems normal.”</p>
 <p>There were Elves surrounding the mountain from East to West as they climbed the mountain together.<br>They were looking for traces of the 1,001 Ranger Brigade and the enemies.</p>
 <p>“Haaaaa.”</p>
 <p>Bud subconsciously let out a sigh.</p>
 <p>‘It’s too slow.’</p>
 <p>He was wrong.<br>It was not slow at all.</p>
 <p>They had already reached the middle of the mountain that the Ranger Brigade had climbed.<br>They would soon arrive at the spot that they believed the Ranger Brigade was located before they lost contact.</p>
 <p>However, their movements just felt as slow as a turtle to Bud.</p>
 <p>Pound. Pound.</p>
 <p>He pounded his chest in frustration.</p>
 <p>It might take months if he tried to investigate with just the people from the Mercenaries Guild.<br>Of course, it would not take very long if they charged straight into Arm's second secret base.</p>
 <p>However, 1,001 people had instantly disappeared without a trace.<br>He needed to figure out what happened.<br>He couldn't save them otherwise.</p>
 <p>However, he had a bad feeling that the chances of the Ranger Brigade members being alive decreased the longer they took.<br>He was starting to get anxious.</p>
 <p>‘…Glenn will soon come to the north.’</p>
 <p>Highest-grade mage Glenn Poeff was Bud’s close friend and one of the core members of the Mercenaries Guild.<br>He would soon come with the core members of the Mercenaries Guild. They would wait for the Mercenary King's orders to save their peers and get revenge.<br>Some people might find it weird that mercenaries were taking action for their peers, but they believed in friendship as well.<br>This was especially true for the guild’s core members who knew the importance of the Ranger Brigade for the Mercenaries Guild's future.<br>That was why they could not just do nothing.</p>
 <p>But the Mercenary King needed to give them some information first.<br>However, for some odd reason…</p>
 <p>‘There’s nothing.’</p>
 <p>There was nothing there.<br>They had climbed up to the middle of the mountain, but there were no traces at all.</p>
 <p>How was this possible?</p>
 <p>“Mercenary King-nim. I will let the eastern search team know that everything is fine here.”</p>
 <p>Bud started to speak after hearing the Elf’s statement. They needed to send their status to the east as well.<br>Bud responded to the thirty-first report with a tired face.</p>
 <p>“Yes, sir. There’s nothing anyway and all we can hear are the animals-”</p>
 <p>‘…Huh?’</p>
 <p>Bud's eyes opened wide.</p>
 <p>“…Mercenary King-nim?”<br>“Hold on!”</p>
 <p>He raised his hand to cover the Elf’s mouth and looked around. It was almost afternoon but the ground was dark because of the tall trees.<br>Bud looked around the dark forest and slowly started to speak.</p>
 <p>“…Have you seen any wild animals?”<br>“Excuse me? We’ve heard a lot of wild anim-!”</p>
 <p>The Elf stopped mid-sentence and opened his eyes wide.</p>
 <p>“Quietly! Please speak quietly!”</p>
 <p>Bud whispered in a quiet but firm voice in the Elf’s ear.<br>The Elf responded in a quiet voice as well. He realized what Bud was trying to say.</p>
 <p>“…We haven't actually seen any wild animals.”</p>
 <p>Normally, people searching like this became most anxious and wary when they didn’t hear anything.</p>
 <p>There were bound to be forests even in a snow-covered mountain full of life forms.<br>Animals ranging from small herbivores to wild predators would have their homes and live with their own sets of rules.</p>
 <p>The Elves, Bud, and the Elementals had heard many different cries that they believed belonged to the animals living on this mountain.<br>That was why they expected that they were somewhere on the mountain.<br>Bud’s gaze sank down. He mumbled very quietly.</p>
 <p>“We made a mistake.”</p>
 <p>Yes, they had made a mistake.</p>
 <p>“We haven't seen any animals.”<br>“Mercenary King-nim-”</p>
 <p>Bud turned around and put his hand on the Elf’s shoulder.</p>
 <p>“Immediately. Contact the west team immediately.”</p>
 <p>His eyes were scanning the area nonstop unlike his hand on the Elf’s shoulder.</p>
 <p>"We are retreating.”<br>“Excuse me?”<br>“Quiet.”</p>
 <p>Bud quieted the Elf who was about to raise his voice. The Elf was looking at Bud with a gaze that was asking what he was talking about.<br>Wasn't he the one who was just complaining that the search speed was too slow just now?</p>
 <p>“Mercenary King-nim, retreating-”<br>“Now!”</p>
 <p>Bud’s gaze sparkled.</p>
 <p>"We haven't seen any living life forms on this mountain. Well, other than us.”</p>
 <p>The Elf turned pale.<br>They haven't seen any life forms other than themselves.<br>There weren’t even any insects.<br>They only heard them.</p>
 <p>They were focused on looking for the search team that they were relieved just to hear the noises.<br>However, seeing them was important as well.</p>
 <p>“Immediately! I will immediately share this information with them!”<br>“Shh.”</p>
 <p>Bud quieted the Elf again.</p>
 <p>Swooooooosh-</p>
 <p>The Elf felt a gust of wind surrounding Bud at that moment. He subconsciously started to frown. The wind by Bud’s side was not the type of wind the Elf usually felt.<br>It was neither the wind of an Elemental nor a natural wind.</p>
 <p>It was an ancient power.<br>Bud was currently using his ancient power.</p>
 <p>His wind attribute ancient power allowed him to tell a person's demeanor or ability by scent or noise.<br>He was using that right now.</p>
 <p>Boom. Boom. Boom.</p>
 <p>Bud could feel his heart beating wildly.</p>
 <p>‘Please be wrong. Please let me be wrong.’</p>
 <p>His mind was currently full of information about the battles against the White Star until now.</p>
 <p>“Ah……”</p>
 <p>Bud sighed.</p>
 <p>“…I can smell it.”</p>
 <p>He could not see anything.<br>But he could smell people, no, the smell of people's abilities.</p>
 <p>There were not just one or two of them.<br>There were a large number of people.<br>However, the only one he could see was the Elf.</p>
 <p>But ancient powers did not lie.</p>
 <p>He could not see people.<br>That meant that what Bud was seeing right now was fake.</p>
 <p>“…Hehe.”</p>
 <p>‘There was more than one Illusionist?’</p>
 <p>He released his grip on the Elf’s shoulder.<br>He then started to speak.</p>
 <p>“Inform all search members.”</p>
 <p>He looked forward and continued to speak.</p>
 <p>"We are retreating immediately.”</p>
 <p>Clang.</p>
 <p>A sharp sword came out of his scabbard.<br>Blue aura shot out at the same time.</p>
 <p>“And prepare for enemies we cannot see that may attack us.”</p>
 <p>The Elf next to Bud urgently gave an order to his Wind Elemental.<br>The numerous pairs of eyes looking at Bud opened wide or shook.</p>
 <p>Enemies they could not see.</p>
 <p>“There are at least a couple hundred of them.”</p>
 <p>Familiar scents covering the entire mountain filled Bud’s nose.<br>People who had this type of smell were usually-</p>
 <p>“They should be assassins.”</p>
 <p>Rustle.</p>
 <p>One of the hidden enemies moved at that moment.</p>
 <p>Claaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaang-</p>
 <p>Bud saw his surroundings breaking as if they were made of glass. He then saw an assassin in Arm’s uniform charging toward him.</p>
 <p>“Die!”</p>
 <p>The assassin flung his dagger at Bud. Bud swung his sword and glared at the person wearing the black outfit.</p>
 <p>Tang, tang!</p>
 <p>Two daggers flew away after hitting Bud’s aura as Bud raised his voice.</p>
 <p>“You must be the bastards who chose to become the White Star’s dogs!”</p>
 <p>Bud was familiar with the dagger attacking method used against him.</p>
 <p>Glenn Poeff.<br>That highest-grade mage was a member of the Poeff household that used to be one of the Eastern continent’s greatest underworld households. He had seen Glenn practicing his family's dagger techniques in the past.<br>He was seeing the same thing in front of him right now.</p>
 <p>Shhhhhhh-</p>
 <p>His surroundings were crumbling.<br>No, the illusion was breaking.</p>
 <p>He could now see the truth.</p>
 <p>“Ha!”</p>
 <p>He could see hundreds of assassins wearing black outfits in the forest.<br>Just like how some assassins had gathered under the revived Molan household, there were some who chose to serve the White Star in Arm.<br>Those people had groomed new subordinates during the past fifteen years as Arm grew its numbers.</p>
 <p>Those people had been hiding in the illusion and waiting for them.</p>
 <p>“…You bastards-”</p>
 <p>Bud’s eyes were full of rage.</p>
 <p>The forest was red.<br>The scent of blood was gone, but many parts of the forest were red.<br>Whose blood would that be?<br>He thought about his subordinates. He held back the flame of anger inside him and started to shout.</p>
 <p>“I said to retreat!”</p>
 <p>The Elves finally started to retreat in shock.</p>
 <p>Why?</p>
 <p>“Just how many people did they station here?!”</p>
 <p>There were hundreds of assassins in front of him and that number was continuing to increase.<br>This probably meant that there were a significant number of assassins throughout the mountain.<br>The Elves started to frown as they tried to retreat.</p>
 <p>“Shit!”</p>
 <p>They saw assassins in the rear as well.<br>They were all Arm members.</p>
 <p>“Ha!”</p>
 <p>Bud scoffed in disbelief.<br>He realized where they had gotten such a large number of people.</p>
 <p>“…I guess they called over every single bastard in the Eastern continent's branches.”</p>
 <p>The Molan household had destroyed one of Arm's secret bases and taken it back, but Arm still had numerous branches, albeit less than the Mercenaries Guild, throughout the Eastern continent.<br>This number made sense if he added the number of people at all those branches together.</p>
 <p>“Mercenary King-nim! It’ll be difficult to retreat like this!”</p>
 <p>He heard the Elf’s anxious voice. It could not be helped. Although there were hundreds of Elves throughout the mountain, there were at least a few thousand of enemies here as well.<br>It was also possible that their every movement had been seen by the enemies as well.</p>
 <p>Huuuuu.</p>
 <p>Bud took a deep breath.<br>He then blinked once.</p>
 <p>His gaze headed toward the peak of the mountain.<br>He smelled it from the area that was covered in white snow.</p>
 <p>It was an odd scent he had never smelled before that was different than the assassins.<br>He was certain that it was the Illusionist.<br>If not, it was probably at least the bastard who planned this whole thing.</p>
 <p>“Follow me. We are charging past them.”</p>
 <p>Bud kicked off the ground. He was moving in the front. The assassins charged toward him at the same time.<br>The Elves took out their weapons as well and their Elementals moved with them.<br>Bud shouted toward the Elf next to him.</p>
 <p>“Please launch a signal in the sky immediately! Also-”</p>
 <p>Launch a signal for Glenn who was at the bottom of the mountain to see.</p>
 <p>In addition…<br>Bud hesitated before finishing his sentence.</p>
 <p>“We need to let Cale Henituse know about the current situation.”</p>
 <p>His gaze headed to the mountain's peak that was completely white.</p>
 <hr>
 <p>“Hmm… It was broken earlier than I expected.”</p>
 <p>At the mountain peak…<br>The individual who sat down on the snow-covered ground repeatedly threw something in his hand in the air and caught it as he looked down the mountain.</p>
 <p>"Should I inform the liege?”</p>
 <p>Plop. Plop.</p>
 <p>The thing in his hand that he was throwing and catching like a toy was a black heart.<br>It was a heart that was as black as dead mana.</p>
 <p>“…Mm. Probably? We've already gathered all the seeds with those who have not been chosen by the gods.”</p>
 <p>A thick smile appeared on the boy's face.</p>
 <p>Plop. Plop.</p>
 <p>The black heart was still in the boy's hand as if it was a toy.</p>
 <hr>
 <p>“…You want this thing?”<br>“Yes.”</p>
 <p>Cale confidently reached his hand out toward Pendrick.<br>The fake World Tree made it so that Cale could easily move his hand.</p>
 <p>“I thought it was for me.”<br>"That is true, but…”</p>
 <p>Pendrick had an awkward expression on his face as he handed the Sword of the World Tree over to Cale.<br>He then shared what the World Tree had told him.</p>
 <p>"The World Tree-nim said that young master-nim’s blood is special.”<br>“My blood?”</p>
 <p>Cale and Choi Han both looked at Pendrick in confusion.<br>Pendrick peeked at the maze that was turning into a mess and quickly whispered.</p>
 <p>“Yes, sir. She said that your blood has more life force and vitality than anyone else. That is why she said that Cale-nim’s blood was the perfect weapon against those with weak vigor or vitality.”</p>
 <p>Cale recalled a thought he had in the past.</p>
 <p>There was a power that opposed dead mana.<br>It was life force.</p>
 <p>When fighting against dead mana, the stupidest and most dangerous yet easiest method was to cover your entire body with blood and charge against the dead mana.<br>Of course, most people were likely to die from a loss of blood first.</p>
 <p>Boom. Boom. Boom.</p>
 <p>Cale felt his heart beating wildly for some reason.</p>
