 <p><span style>Chapter 170 – Reputation Leaderboard of the Three Realms</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within the Immortality Peach Garden.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Splendid songs could be heard, and beautiful dances could be seen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Jade Emperor and the Queen Mother sat on top of high chairs, looking down at the dancing fairies below.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The eyes of the Jade Emperor, who saw on the throne, suddenly flashed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All leave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Jade Emperor chased all the deities from the Immortality Peach Garden without any kind of sign beforehand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Queen Mother, who was beside him, looked at him in confusion, “What happened?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Jade Emperor did not reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He reached forward with his right hand, causing a huge board to fall down from the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reputation Leaderboard of the Three Realms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those words were written in large and gold writing at the very top, while the Reputation of each deity was listed below them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In first place was Amitabha [1.</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit%C4%81bha" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit%C4%81bha</span></a><span style>] of Sukhavati [2.</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukhavati" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukhavati</span></a><span style>]. His Reputation was at 127456.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The next was the Jade Emperor, whose Reputation reached 35427.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In third place was the Great Sacred Emperor Equaling Heaven of the Underworld, whose Reputation reached 27968.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shakyamuni of the western Buddhist domain followed closely afterwards with a Reputation of 26473.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened? Why did you bring out the Reputation Leaderboard?” The Queen Mother was confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the Jade Emperor continued to scroll down the leaderboard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fifth place on the leaderboard already had a Reputation lower than ten thousand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ones lower down became even more pitiful…</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he reached the bottom of the leaderboard…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only Idealism. Reputation: 1.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was clear that the Queen Mother also saw this person at the very end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Call Taibai!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ten-odd minutes later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing hurried in from the outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jade Emperor, you were looking for me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was shocked when he saw the Reputation Leaderboard of the Three Realms floating in midair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This leaderboard held an important meaning. The fact that the Jade Emperor brought it out, and called him over…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you know that someone new has entered the Reputation Leaderboard of the Three Realms?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“About this…” Taibai Jinxing paused for a moment, then shook his head. “I don’t.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then that means it isn’t someone of our Heavenly Court?” The Jade Emperor frowned even more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing quickly replied, “I’m not certain, someone might have entered the leaderboard and not yet reported it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go investigate!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing looked up slightly, then floated away from the Immortality Peach Garden with the fly-whisk in his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Queen Mother only asked softly after Taibai left, “Is there something weird about it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s very weird,” the Jade Emperor waved his hand and put away the Reputation Leaderboard of the Three Realms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s so weird about it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Reputation Leaderboard of the Three Realms hasn’t had anyone new for thousands of years. The ones on it are usually people of great ability in the Heavenly Court, Underworld, or part of the Immortal Region of the Rogue Immortals. Gaining Reputation is beyond difficult. Putting me aside, and just talking about you. We’ve been alive for several hundreds of thousands of years, but your Reputation is merely only two digits.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not having anyone enter the leaderboard in a thousand years doesn’t mean that there won’t be anyone new. Is there a need for you to be so careful!” The Queen Mother asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Jade Emperor shook his head, “You don’t understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Reputation Conference of the Three Realms will begin in around a thousand days.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person didn’t enter the leaderboard earlier or later, they just had to get onto the leaderboard now!</span></p>
 <p><span style>How could this not make him worry?</span></p>
 <p><span style>It would be alright if it was someone of the Heavenly Court, but if it was of the other two realms…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re too sensitive,” The Queen Mother got off her chair and rubbed the Jade Emperor’s shoulders lightly. “Regardless of who this new person is, he merely has a Reputation of 1, and is at the very end of the leaderboard. As the Jade Emperor of the Heavenly Court, your reputation is merely below Amitabha of Sukhavati, no matter who this person is, he won’t be able to affect the Conference of the Three Realms that’s going to be held a thousand days from now. If he wanted to cause the positions of those in the Three Realm to shuffle, he would have to be at least in the top ten of the leaderboard… You’re worrying too much.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It might really be the fact that those closely involved could not see clearly.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>After he heard the Queen Mother’s words, the Jade Emperor managed to relaxed his nervous mood.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That’s true!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>No matter what, I am the Jade Emperor who’s in second place.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>This new person on the leaderboard wouldn’t affect me at all.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You… If you have the effort, why don’t you go and manage our Heavenly Court.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened?” The Jade Emperor was surprised. Recently, he had barely minded the situation in the Heavenly Court aside from the morning conferences.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A bunch of weird and delicious snacks and drinks without celestial effects were suddenly introduced into the Heavenly Court. However, there are some that would harm a human’s bodily functions…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh? Who did it!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems to be Yue Lao.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Jade Emperor chuckled when he heard the name.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That geezer will often do some weird stuff, let’s not mind it. You said it as well, although the foods aren’t healthy, they are delicious, so just let them eat it. As for harming a human’s bodily functions, we are already immortals…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, the Jade Emperor paid it no mind anyone and once again concentrated on that Only Idealism.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within the Underworld.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Inside a dark palace, the Great Sacred Emperor Equaling Heaven also had a huge leaderboard floating in front of him like the Jade Emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the Reputation Leaderboard of the Three Realms!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most importantly, his gaze was also set on Only Idealism, who was in last place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A new person has entered the leaderboard. Only Idealism, I wonder which realm is this master from.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He laughed softly, then put the leaderboard away and hid back into the darkness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the Immortal Region!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, as well as the three great Celestial Sovereigns were within an Immortal Palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fuxi[1. Fuxi/伏羲 (</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuxi" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuxi</span></a><span style>) is one of the Three Sovereigns. He is the brother (and husband in some variation of the myths) of Nüwa. He is also the son of Suiren.], “Who do you think this Only Idealism is?” Suiren [2. Suiren/燧人氏 (</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suiren" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suiren</span></a><span style>) is the leader of the Three Sovereigns. He is also the person who invented the method to gain fire.] asked, while wearing beast-skin clothes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fuxi shook his head, “Esteemed Father, this child cannot calculate who this person is.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior Suiren, Senior Fuxi, this emperor feels like who this Only Idealism is doesn’t have much to do with us,” said Yao [3. Yao/尧 (</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Yao" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Yao</span></a><span style>) is one of the Five Emperors. He is the inventor of Go.], as he pursed his lips and smiled. “If you were to talk about worry, then the Jade Emperor should be more worried. The Heavenly Court’s position has not been changed in a hundred thousand years, and this time, the ones in the Underworld are rather set to pounce during this Conference of the Three Realms…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yao is right,” Shun [4. Shun/舜 (</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Shun" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Shun</span></a><span style>) is one of the Five Emperors. He is the successor of Yao’s throne.] agreed on the side. “We, the Immortal Region, have always been neutral, and outside of the relationship between the Underworld and the Heavenly Court. This shouldn’t have much of an effect on us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, let’s not worry about this for nothing,” Shennong [5. Shennong/神农 (</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shennong" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shennong</span></a><span style>) is one of the Three Sovereigns. He is the legendary inventor of agriculture and medicine.] shook his head, then put the leaderboard away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, then let’s ignore it. Oh yeah, has there been any news of Yellow Emperor’s reincarnation?” Fuxi nodded, then looked towards the three Celestial Sovereigns.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We have not received any news on Yellow Emperor’s reincarnation,” the three Celestial Sovereigns shook their heads. Only Great Emperor Qingming’s face slightly changed, but he still nodded alongside the other Celestial Sovereigns.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s a pity, you must put more effort into it. Although we, the Immortal Region, have a special position, but we are rather weak. The Yellow Emperor’s ninth reincarnation will definitely allow him to reach the level of Immortal King. That fact is extremely important for us, the Immortal Region.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Great Emperor Qingming looked up as if he had something to say, only to stop himself once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qingming, you have something to say?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No,” Great Emperor Qingming shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then that’s everything,” Fuxi swept his gaze across everyone in the manor. “Father and I will be journeying for a bit and pay more attention to the possible news of Yellow Emperor’s reincarnation. You guys should do the same and find Yellow Emperor as quick as possible in order to protect him. Understood?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!” The Immortals all nodded.</span></p>
