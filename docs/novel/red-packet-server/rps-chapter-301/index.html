 <p><span style>Chapter 301 – The Old Butler and Body Double</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Ye!” Wei Chen pushed Ye Zichen to the side. Meanwhile, the old butler, who stood behind Huo Da, also raced forward and chopped down Huo Da’s neck with a knife hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…” Huo Da turned around in confusion. He never could have expected the old butler, who had been with him for ten-odd years, would actually attack him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Retard, go to sleep!” The old butler chopped down on Huo Da’s neck once again when he saw that Huo Da did not faint from the first blow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huo Da fell to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they entered, Ye Zichen did not notice the gun in Huo Da’s hand at all, so it was extremely fortunate that Wei Chen had pushed him away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Wei!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey,” Wei Chen smiled, then opened his palm, revealing a bullet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wei Chen chucked the bullet onto the floor and twisted his neck, “That damn thing is pretty powerful, it really hurt my hand!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who was worried about Wei Chen just moments earlier, couldn’t help but roll his eyes, “F*ck that, you’re crazy!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Even I, who had Unbreakable Body, could not defend against hot weapons. Wei Chen is just of the False Earth immortal level, he could actually catch a bullet with his bare hand…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could he be a body cultivator?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>His skin is truly thick!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the old butler snickered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked up upon hearing the sound, and finally noticed the old man in butler-clothing standing opposite him, who held Huo Da like a dead dog.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The old butler threw Huo Da in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The person you guys want is him, right? Here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked down at Huo Da, who was beside his feet, then looked up and raised his eyebrows with a smile, “Internal conflict? Zeze, don’t worry, I won’t trouble you, I’m just rather interested in Huo Da.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do whatever you want,” The old butler smile. “Let me give you a tip. Huo Da just killed someone. The gun on the floor has his fingerprints. If you want to deal with him, then you can use that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen glanced at the room and saw that someone truly did fall in the room.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>No wonder there was a gory smell when I just entered the room!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Also, the dead guy can change his looks. The person that went to assassinate you last time was him. Yu is pretty strong as well, you can make him work for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…” Ye Zichen’s expression suddenly turned dark.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What this geezer is saying is already way more than what someone that was asking to be spared should say. He seems to be just telling me something as if he was originally on my side.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Just who are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t need to mind it,” the old butler smile. “We’ll meet again in the future, but I might not be using this identity. I have faith in you, kid…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, the old man’s body begun to crumble like a character made out of data in television shows, then eventually disappearing from the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A Body Double!” Wei Chen’s eye twitched.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who stood on the side, revealed a look of confusion. Just when he wanted to ask what was a “Body Double”, the security guards for the hotel arrived.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are you!?” The security guards asked angrily, while the clear smell of blood caused them to frown…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within moments, they noticed the person in the pool of blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Subdue them and call the police!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, hey, hey, dude, I’m telling you, this brat was the one who killed the guy,” Ye Zichen kicked Huo Da, who was on the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That has nothing to do with us. Call the police!” roared the security guard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Ye Zichen’s phone rang, and the caller ID showed that it was Old Man Su.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had received the news about Xiao Yumei getting into a car accident as well. It was a rather severe issue for him since the medical company she works in proivides exclusive pills to the military.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cooperating with the military makes it half a nationalized company.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A management level person getting endangered was no small matter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Man Su!” The moment Ye Zichen place the phone by his ear, the security guard immediately rushed over to grab it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Wei Chen immediately stopped the man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Put the phone down. You are not allowed to talk to anyone before the police arrive!” the guard shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on over there?” Old Man Su heard the guard’s voice. “You’re in trouble?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ignore it and say what you need to. What is it?” Ye Zichen said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just tell me if you’re in trouble, I’ll help you deal with it,” Old Man Su said another word of car. “I heard Lil’ Xiao was in a car accident?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You know everything?” Ye Zichen was stunned. “She’s fine though.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s good that she’s fine,” Old Man Su said with a smile. “The perpetrator has to be severely punished. If I put it nicely, it was intentional assault, if I put it severely, then it’s treason! I already sent people out to capture him. If we do capture him, then we’ll take him onto the court martial. I promise to give you a solution for it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…” Ye Zichen blanked out for a moment. “I already caught the person!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen finally hung up the call, the security guard was still continuing to yammer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen patted Wei Chen’s shoulder, then raised his eyebrows at the security guard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dude, we’re good citizens. You don’t need to care about all this, the military will come over and deal with all this later!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“?” The security guard revealed a look of confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you guys don’t believe me, then just wait there. The two of us are going to wait in the room for the military. If you guys don’t believe us, then wait here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows at Wei Chen, then sat down on the sofa in the living room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The guard captain was stunned for a split second before he turned to his team members, “Stay on guard here and protect the scene! You guys can make a move if they make any unusual movements!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen gave the guards a thumbs up in his mind. </span><i><span style>If anyone else is met with this sort of situation, they would try their best to avoid it, I didn’t think that they could actually still fearlessly stand here.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Ye, we’re really just going to stay here?” Wei Chen glanced at the guards. “If you want to run, then we’ll definitely be able to make it out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need, the military is coming over soon. Why are we running when they’re our people?” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes speechlessly. “Tell me, just what is the Body Double you spoke of?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wei Chen immediately put on a serious expression, “A Body Double is basically another body that the original one split off in order to breakthrough in their cultivation realms! It is similar to reincarnation, but has a worse effect. They will have a separate consciousness, but if the main body wants, they are still able to control the Body Double!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That elder was a Body Double. You saw him disappear because the main body took him back. But the people that can form a Body Double are all at least of the Human Immortal level…” Wei Chen said solemnly.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Original Chapter Teaser:</b>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Dear Diary,</p>
 <p>Today's events left me utterly speechless.</p>
 <p>First of all, Yumei being endangered completely pissed me off. I know Huo Da was probably trying to get me since it was my car, but him going for Yumei was unforgivable.</p>
 <p>Second of all, Huo Da's pretty much gone nuts. Regardless of the circumstance, I can't believe that he would actually lose his cool so much. That being said, the threat of him should be more or less gone now, especially since Old Man Su did call and gave me a good promise.</p>
 <p>Third of all, the butler guy... Just... What is going on? I hate the feeling of being unable to control everything. It's as if these deities and cultivators just put everything in motion around me without me knowing anything. The way he spoke... Frankly, it pissed me off. What's wrong with these people? Like seriously. Can they actually give out information? My god, just tell me what the f*ck is going on now! These coincidences are too extreme, it's as if this is a novel!</p>
