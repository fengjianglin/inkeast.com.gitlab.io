 <p><span style>Chapter 251 – Change of Plan</span></p>
 <p><span style>Would you like to use Thousand-Li Tracking Sigil?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Note: Thousand-Li Tracking Sigil is a consumable item. It locates the target for three hours.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Please select the target. It is limited to a person or item that you have seen before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li En!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The image of a scene appeared in Ye Zichen’s mind just moments after confirmation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li En smiled coldly in the image, while he held a cigar in his hands. A phone was placed on the table in front of him as if he was waiting for somebody’s call.</span></p>
 <p><span style>More importantly, Mu Chuang was there as well, and he seemed to be having a great time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow…” Ye Zichen shook his head and smiled. </span><i><span style>This is rather like a scam</span></i><span style><span><a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></span></span><i><span style>!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was unable to hear the conversation going on in the image, nor was he able to be sure of the precise location of it, but he could tell from the image that…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it?” Mu Jinglei raised his eyebrows. “You said there needs to be a change of plans, but what’s the change?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The plan has been changed again!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen licked his lips as he pondered about whether he should tell Mu Jinglei about the scene he saw.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he thought about it, then realized that she wouldn’t be able to understand even if he told her about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why was there a change needed again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the phone in Mu Jinglei’s pocket rang. The moment she saw the caller ID, her face became stark white.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“… It’s a call from the casino!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Answer it! Put it on speakerphone!” In contrast, Ye Zichen appeared a lot calmer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, Mu Jinglei turned on speaker mode as he requested.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Miss Mu, I wonder how goes your efforts to gather money?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen yanked her forcefully, and spoke up at the same time, “We can’t gather three million, we just have one million. Are you the owner of the casino? We want to test our luck at your place to see if we can win three million to get him back!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am Mu Jinglei’s friend, she got the money from me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, Miss Mu has the relationship to borrow three million, yet you guys said that you only have one million. Are you messing with me?” The man on the other side of the call snorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, no, no. We truly want to get Mu Chuang back, but money’s a little tight. Can you please give us a chance?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait a moment,” The man on the other side of the call laughed sinisterly, then handed his phone back to his subordinate and walked into a room at the back of the casino.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Director Mu, it seems to be a different from what you said. They said that they only have one million, and wants to gamble a few times here to win enough to get the guy back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that so?” Li En laughed. “Then let then, isn’t earning an extra million a good thing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, the man left the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Li En looked towards Mu Chuang, “There are truly quite a few men at your older sister’s side…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe,” Mu Chuang laughed idiotically.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li En squinted his eyes, “Are you cooperating with me sincerely?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, I’m truly sincere!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then pray for you sister to lose!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a long while, various buzzes sounded out from the other side of the call, while the man also spoke up, “Fine, come. You know the address!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the call ended, a complicated emotion surfaced in Mu Jinglei’s eyes, “Zichen, why did you say that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Naturally, I have my own plans!” Ye Zichen smiled mysteriously, then leaned back in his seat. “Let’s go. It’s time to win money!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Half an hour later, Mu Jinglei parked the car in front of a supermarket in the suburbs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone got off the car and walked into the supermarket.</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>The moment they walked in, Mu Jinglei called out towards the cashier, “Cougar<a id="footnoteref-2" href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>!”</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>The cashier raised his eyebrows slightly. At the same time, Ye Zichen patted his briefcase, opened it to reveal it being stuffed full of hundred yuan notes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, the three of them arrived at a place underneath the supermarket under the guidance of the cashier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was stunned the moment he arrived.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Nobody could have imagined that such a scene existed underneath a seemingly normal supermarket.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The place was filled with smoke, while curses would be heard at times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir, Ma’am…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Exchange a million into chips for us!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen handed over the two briefcases in his hand. The man, wearing a waiter uniform, raised his eyebrows and left the briefcases. Not long later, he returned with a tray full of chips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Enjoy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen!” I want to play!” Lu Lu reached out to grab some chips, since she could not suppress her curiosity any longer.</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>Ye Zichen handed her five hundred thousand yuan of chips for her to use, then took Mu Jinglei to a Sic Bo<a id="footnoteref-3" href="#footnote-3">[3]</a> place.</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hands off when you’ve placed the bets!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many people chucked their chips to the corresponding location. At the same time, Ye Zichen’s eyes lit up with a faint golden light.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Fiery Eyes of Truth, activate!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I truly can see the numbers on the dice.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled, then chucked a hundred thousand yuan chip to where it said small.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Five, five, six. Big!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Oh?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the heck is going on?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I clearly saw small using my Fiery Eyes of Truth just now. </span></i><span style>The house collected the chips under the complaints of the people. Then, Ye Zichen played another round in disbelief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He lost again!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen!” Since it was Mu Jinglei’s first time to somewhere like this, her palms became covered in sweat when she saw Ye Zichen lose like that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, Lu Lu walked back with a pout of dissatisfaction. From the looks of it…</span></p>
 <p><span style>She lost everything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s no fun, people are controlling all the games here,” Lu Lu muttered softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Ye Zichen yanked her, “You said someone is controlling it!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah! It’s been so many times! I want to hit them so much!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then, I’m just asking, could you change these dice to a number we want?” Ye Zichen pointed to the Sic Bo place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Lu pouted, “It should be fine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Ye Zichen hugged Lu Lu happily, and whispered, “Let’s cooperate later…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Ye Zichen muttered some things by Lu Lu’s ear for quite a while, he called a waiter over to exchange another million yuan of chips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, in the room at the back of the casino…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Director Li, they exchanged for another million!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need to tell me. Earning money is a good thing. Make them continue to lose without winning at all!” Li En smiled faintly. “Since they’re giving us money, we have to accept it!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Fiery Eyes of Truth, activate!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stared straight at the dice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Lu Lu whispered in his ear, “What numbers do you want?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Three threes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure!” Lu Lu replied before turning quiet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen also surveyed the changes of the numbers on the dice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hands off when you’ve placed the bets!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen bet five hundred thousand on cougar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Plenty of people shook their heads when they saw him bet on cougar.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He definitely went crazy from losing. Getting cougars isn’t that simple at all.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Even the person shaking the dice rolled his eyes subconsciously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He smiled as he glanced at the chips on the table, then slightly tapped it.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The numbers changed!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Ye Zichen, who was staring at the changes in the number gave Lu Lu a signal.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Open!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Three, three, three!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cougar!</span></p>

   <li><span id="footnote-1">To be more specific, the type of scam being referred to is Immortal Jump (仙人跳). Basically, a female would usually lure a male victim somewhere to have sex (either because the female is fake hooking up with him, or just pretending to be a prostitute). Then, a male accomplice(s) would then arrive at the scene. Since the victim is either intimidated or just doesn’t want the news to spread, he will pay the male accomplice(s) and the female to keep their mouths shut.<a href="#footnoteref-1" class="btn btn-sm btn-link"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></span></li>
