 <p><span style>Chapter 283 – An Invisible Slap</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person that came was no other than Zu Siliang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To be frank, Ye Zichen was rather surprised by Zu Siliang accepting the invitation to this sort of small gathering.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Zu Siliang was also stunned the moment he entered the room. The reason he chose to attend the gathering was merely because he would have passed by the clubhouse as he was going to meet with a client and that a friend of his had mentioned the gathering to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He never expected to meet Ye Zichen there. Even the bodyguards behind Zu Siliang were shocked…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why did we bump into this lord?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Director Zu,” Gong Chang stood up from the chair with a subservient smile. “Let me introduce them to Director Zu. These are Director Xiao and Director Cai, and I’m called Gong Cheng.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, he even humbly handed his name card over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zu Siliang was stunned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked blankly at Ye Zichen, who was smiling faintly on the sofa, “This friend…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Him?” Gong Cheng said with a look of disdain. “No need to mind him, Director Zu, he’s Director Xiao’s boyfriend.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The underlying meaning was basically saying that the brat was nothing except a sugar baby leeching off someone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zu Siliang couldn’t help but laugh, “Young Master Ye, the number of female friends by your side is truly envious.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you want, tons of woman will crawl to your side with but a wave of your hands, right?” Ye Zichen smiled, then twitched his mouth. “You truly put on airs. I have waited here for you for a good hour.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zu Siliang poured a glass of wine into a wine glass on the table and finished it one gulp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Treat that as me apologizing to Young Master Ye. If I knew that Young Master Ye was here, I definitely wouldn’t have taken so long.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone in the room was shocked, and the person with the worst expression was none other than Gong Cheng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The guest that he had to carefully welcome actually knew the person he thought was merely a sugar baby. From the looks of things, the two were rather familiar with one another, and his important guest was even extremely careful around that ‘sugar baby’.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just what is going on…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, although Xiao Yumei did not understand the situation, she could tell that Ye Zichen knew the important guest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She subconsciously glanced over at Gong Cheng, and smiled proudly when she saw his shocked expression…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>My man is the best. That guy just mocked my man just now, see? He just got face-smacked!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Sit,” At that moment, Ye Zichen instantly became the person with the most authority in the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Ye Zichen signaled Zu Siliang to sit down, the latter raised his eyebrows, “I wonder what business do you have with me? Young Master Ye is actually here too! If there is anything that requires my action, Young Master Ye just needs to go directly to me, I will definitely help out fully. What’s the point of asking in such a roundabout manner?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zu Siliang’s words gave a lot of face to Ye Zichen, while Gong Cheng, who sat on the side, felt the invisible palm smack him loudly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the very beginning, Ye Zichen had never once cared about his provocations, he had thought that Ye Zichen was just shameless…</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he finally understood. Ye Zichen didn’t think much of it at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His actions were comparable to an insect showing off his achievement in front of a lion, while the latter completely disregarded them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The difference was too great, so there was no need for the lion to mind at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Before that, let me introduce someone to you,” Ye Zichen smiled faintly, and glanced towards Xiao Yumei. “This is Director Xiao, Xiao Yumei of Maintaining Beauty International.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiao Yumei, the same Director Xiao who once managed a jewelry company?” Zu Siliang raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, I didn’t think that you would know.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Naturally, I know of her,she is someone who is among the top of all the female bosses in Bingcheng in both beauty and capability,” Zu Siliang smiled. “Could the person looking for me be Director Xiao? If that’s the case, then just get Young Master Ye to find me directly. What’s the point of going about in such a roundabout manner!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Some small issue came up in the middle, but don’t mind the details,” With that, Ye Zichen smiled towards Xiao Yumei. “Say it, Director Zu could be considered someone that’s rather close to Yang Yushi.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s actually related to Yang Yushi?” Zu Siliang was surprised, while the expression on his face turned rather unusual.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They didn’t even to go through him to find Yang Yushi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With Ye Zichen’s relationship with Yang Yushi…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Director Zu, it’s like this…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, Xiao Yumei sincerely talked about the reason for their meeting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zu Siliang only felt as speechless as it was humanly possible. </span><i><span style>Why find me when you want to get Yang Yushi to endorse you guys, just directly go to the talent agency…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s more, Ye Zichen’s words are much more effective than mine.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem, I will definitely relay Director Xiao’s message to her,” Zu Siliang smiled, then looked towards Ye Zichen. “Brother Ye, how about I tell Yushi that this company is yours…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your choice, just say it if you want, but I feel like not saying it is better. I don’t want to put any burden on her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zu Siliang let out a soft sigh, then nodded, “Alright, then I’ll decide for myself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong dong dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The door to the room was pushed open. The supervisor of the clubhouse pushed a trolley in with some deserts, a fruit platter and plenty of expensive alcohol, then smiled towards Ye Zichen, “Mr. Ye, why didn’t you tell us you were coming beforehand? This is the fruit platter and alcohol that our owner is giving you, we wish you a happy time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Han Yu truly knows how to show surface formality,” Ye Zichen smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Xiao Yumei raised her eyebrows, “This is Han Yu’s clubhouse?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah,” Ye Zichen shook his head, stood up from the sofa and stretched lazily before walking in front of that supervisor. “Go back and tell Han Yu that I thank him for his good will.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen patted the supervisor’s shoulder, then walked out of the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After him, everyone also followed suit. At that very moment, Gong Cheng’s face was smacked by an invisible palm countless times, almost to the point of becoming swollen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The accomplishments and contacts he had thought so highly of were merely a joke in the eyes of Ye Zichen, who he thought was just a lowly sugar baby.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After they walked out of the clubhouse, Zu Siliang left first.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other four stood together. At that moment, Gong Cheng had already lost all of the cockiness that he had in the room. Since he was smacked by an invisible palm countless times, he finally learnt his lesson…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mr. Ye, there was much offense just now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re not calling me Little Brother Ye anymore?” Ye Zichen smiled softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gong Cheng answered frantically, “Mr. Ye, it was my mistake just now. I ask for forgiveness.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen answered with a shrug, then ignored him and looked at the time, “It’s getting late, let’s part ways here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, he got into his car. Xiao Yumei also chatted a bit before getting in. However, to nobody’s expectation, Cai Xinyu also got in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yumei, your little man is pretty amazing!” Cai Xinyu’s eyes were filled with a meaningful look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei sighed softly, “Why did you not return to your car and instead climbed into mine?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m rather interested in your little man. No, I am attracted by your little man, so my body just got in here uncontrollably,” Cai Xinyu smiled faintly. “How about lending me your little man for a day?”</span></p>
