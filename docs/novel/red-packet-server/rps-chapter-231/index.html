 <p><span style>Chapter 231 – Previous Life</span></p>
 <p><span style>The entire classroom was shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No one expected that this new school beauty, who had just transferred to Polytechnic University, would be taken by the School Beauty Harvester so randomly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Ye Zichen looked at the girl in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, I’m never going to be done with you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Someone shouted in the classroom, causing everyone else to shout the same. Not long later, only ten-odd students remained in the classroom that was once full.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s roommates also smiled wryly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kang Peng even sighed, then patted Ye Zichen’s shoulder, “Bless you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen’s roommates left the classroom in depression. A hint of a smile surfaced on Lu Lu’s face in secret, but she still tilted her head, “Why did they all leave?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“… Girl, you truly kill without being detected!” Ye Zichen let out a long sigh towards Lu Lu, then stood up from his seat and left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, Tall Guy, don’t leave!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, the rest of the students in the classroom also left in pairs and threes. When Mu Jinglei returned and saw the empty classroom…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where did they all go!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the sports field of Polytechnic University.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sat on the grass, while an undeniable helpless expression was on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Girl, just what’s with you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>While they sat on the grass, male students would look over at Ye Zichen with a hostile look once in awhile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Lu, who sat beside him used her hand to block the sun, tilted her head and asked with a cute expression, “What’s with me, what do you mean?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You tell me what’s with you!” Ye Zichen turned and looked straight at her. “Why did you have to say that in class just now? Also, can you stop following me!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Because that’s what I feel in my heart. I just want to follow you, is that not okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Seriously…” Ye Zichen stood up in annoyance. </span><i><span style>Since I can’t deal with her, I’ll just avoid her!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, before he could even take a few steps, Lu Lu followed him once again like a shadow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What exactly do you want!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you being so mean!” Lu Lu frowned, while her bright eyes began to water. “You weren’t anything like this in your past life!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You loved to follow me in your past life! Even if I chased you away, you would still follow me. This time, I’m following you, but you’re actually so mean to me! If I knew this beforehand, then I wouldn’t have come to find you!” Lu Lu wrinkled her face as if she would cry at any moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s expression stiffened as he looked meaningfully at Lu Lu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You what?” Lu Lu frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, Ye Zichen felt like his brain was no longer enough.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Past life.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Do people really have a past life?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at Lu Lu in confusion, then sat down on the grass and asked curiously, “Did I really have a past life?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course,” Lu Lu sat down right beside him. “I found you according to the smell of your past life, but you aren’t cute at all in this life.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t remember anything at all?” Lu Lu raised her eyebrows. When she saw Ye Zichen’s confused look, she pouted. “I told you before that you can become a deity if you ate that inner core, but you just refused!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every single one of Lu Lu’s sentences completely challenged Ye Zichen’s understanding of the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though his heart kept on telling him not to continue asking since that might cause him unnecessary trouble.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He still couldn’t help but to want to know everything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What kind of person was I in my previous life?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You?” Lu Lu smiled, then said with a faint blush. “You were very cute in your previous life, very smart, and very responsible. You were also very heroic.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that so?” Ye Zichen was momentarily stunned. </span><i><span style>From the sound of it, my previous life was pretty amazing.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But why do I feel like I’ve lost to my previous life?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“But you had a lot of girl friends around you at the time. After you died, some of them did seem to have reincarnated with you, but I can’t compare up to them in regards to that. However, actually, I wanted to reincarnate with you… But…” Lu Lu bit her lips and wanted to speak, but then stopped herself. After a long time, she suddenly stood up and stuck her nose next to Ye Zichen’s and looked him straight in the eye. “You have to believe me, there is a reason why I didn’t reincarnate with you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gulp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen furiously gulped…</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was too close. He could even feel her breath and smell the faint fragrance of her body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s heart started to race. At that very moment…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen!” A beyond furious roar sounded out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s body shuddered when he heard that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Lu also looked behind her, “Oh…?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh what?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke put her hands on her waist, while Su Yan, who was squinting as she hugged her shoulders, stood behind her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t you know that Ye Zichen is Su Yan’s and my boyfriend? You aren’t learning the right stuff at such a young age and actually learnt to seduce someone else’s boyfriend!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t recognize me anymore?” Lu Lu tiled her head and pointed at herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Xia Keke rolled her eyes, “Who wants to recognize you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, she grabbed Ye Zichen’s arm, “I look away for just a moment, and you’re flirting with others already. Hurry up and leave, have no more contact with this girl in the future.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Lu Lu saw that Ye Zichen and co. wanted to leave, Lu Lu frowned, then wanted to follow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t follow us, don’t think that we can be pushed around. If you piss me off, I know how to fight too!” Xia Keke glared at Lu Lu fiercely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did Lu Lu stop, twitch her mouth and muttered, “Why are you so mean? You fought over him with me in your previous life, but I didn’t act like this either!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A hint of sadness suddenly surfaced on her face, while an unforgettable scene appeared in her mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Su Yan, Xia Liuli, stop!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A woman that wore expensive clothing ran forward as she lifted her skirt with her right hand. Two women stood in front of her, both of them were so dazzling that she was unable to compare up to them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lu Lu? What did you come here for? Didn’t you decide not to be with him anymore?” Xia Liuli frowned, meanwhile, a black door stood behind her and Su Yan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I… Are you two really going to reincarnate with him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?” Su Yan answered with a slightly cold tone, while she looked at Lu Lu with cat-like eyes and an unexplainable smile. “Can’t we?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, why must you reincarnate over and over again with a mortal? What do you two get out of it? He won’t have his memories of his previous life after reincarnation. Didn’t you two tell me yourselves that staying by him, who doesn’t remember you, is extremely painful?” Lu Lu shouted with a frown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan and Xia Liuli both smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However, if we don’t follow him, we’ll be in even more pain! Indeed, he didn’t recognize us these few lives, but there will be a day that he remembers us… How special is he… You, who was lucky in this life, should understand this more clearly than us. The future you will truly regret it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan and Xia Liuli looked at each other with a smile, then stepped into that black gate together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I really should have chosen to reincarnate. I clearly had the upper hand during his previous life, but during this life, the two of you got to his side first! To be honest, I am regretting it!”</span></p>
 <p></p>

 <p><em>In the perspective of muscle guy in a black vest.</em></p>
 <p>WHAT!? Did I hear it right? This... This new girl actually said something like that? What has the world come to?</p>
 <p>I literally just told her all the faults with the School Beauty Harvester, and she actually still wants to be with him? This is so unfair. The world is so unfair! This life is so unfair! Why is he able to have such relationships with all four of the school beauties? Why do girls just keep going to him like that!? Just why!?</p>
 <p>No.</p>
 <p>No.</p>
 <p>No.</p>
 <p>I can't let this slide. I must do something. For the future of all us singles, I must fight back. I must resist.</p>
 <p>Oh yeah, that's right, he's supposed to be in a relationship with School Beauty Sun and School Beauty Xia, right? Let me just tell them. Muahahaha, may the wrath of the goddesses rain down about that stupid harvester!</p>
