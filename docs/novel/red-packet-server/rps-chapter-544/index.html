 <p><span style>Chapter 544 – Staying in the City Lord Manor</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen could kind of understand as he looked at how troubled Earth Traveler Sun was.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He had went through a lot in order to marry Deng Chanyu. Now, his beautiful wife is in the Heavenly Court, while he’s below, the fact that they haven’t even met for several hundred years is even more pitiful than the cowherder and the weaver girl.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, I see. Then I’ll find some time to ask the Jade Emperor about this!” Ye Zichen patted Earth Traveler Sun’s shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing his words, Earth Traveler Sun nodded his head like a chicken pecking rice, “Then thank you, Sire.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Welcome. But before that, can you tell me the details about Mount Supreme?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I actually don’t know too much myself, but according the information I gathered over the several hundred years here, Mount Supreme should be a place of inheritance of a certain Earth Supreme from the God Realm. It is a place of both danger and opportunities,” Earth Traveler Sun replied. Actually, he also only knew very little about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After all, Mount Supreme had never appeared before, and all of the information were passed down from primordial times. The only reason people were so focused on it was because someone had predicted Mount Supreme would appear soon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then since you’re stationed here, is it because Mount Supreme is supposed to appear here?” Ye Zichen asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Jade Emperor told me to station here when I came down, so it should appear around here,” Earth Traveler Sun said hesitantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded </span><i><span style>I didn’t expect there to be so many things for me to do on this trip over to Pond City.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Get the fire, find the pendant!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>If Mount Supreme is going to appear here, then since I possess one of its keys, I might have to fight others as well.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, then that’s it. I actually have other things to do over here, so I won’t stay too long here,” Ye Zichen said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earth Traveler Sun also nodded with a smile, “Then I’ll send you off. I hope you can remember to mention this to the Jade Emperor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Certainly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Ye Zichen left the tent with a soft smile, Qiu Yue also stuck his tongue out at Ma Teng, then followed suit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After all three of them departed, Earth Traveler Sun suddenly turned around with a cold look, then snorted at Ma Teng, “My good disciple, what you said earlier was actually all stuff that you wanted to say, right!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master, you must be hungry now. I’ll go and cook for you immediately,” Ma Teng tried leave the tent with a wry smile, only to be tied up by Earth Traveler Sun’s Immortal Binding Rope.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t go and cook. Lay down here and rethink your actions!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you so much. Ma Teng definitely went to ask my father for money again. Oh yeah, I wonder how should I address the two of you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zuo Mo.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen and Zuo Mo answered together. In Ye Zichen's opinion, this city lord’s son was a bit dim. </span><i><span style>If he was even a bit smarter, he wouldn’t have been caught by the bandit four times in a single month.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Ye, Lady Zuo, are the two of you a couple?” Qiu Yuan asked with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Mo pouted with a blush, “Who’s a couple with him!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’re just good friends,” Ye Zichen said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Qiu Yuan quickly apologized, “Sorry, I said the wrong thing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No worries.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the carriage stopped once more. The driver pushed aside the curtains and said to Zuo Mo, “Young Lady, another group of people with torches appeared in the front.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It can’t be!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen and Zuo Mo looked at each other. </span><i><span style>Did we get out of danger, only to fall into another dire situation? </span></i><span style>Thus, they all looked out the curtains, only to see Qiu Yuan suddenly chuckle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry, it should be my father.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, he jumped down from the car and waved to the incoming people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, the city lord’s people had arrived. The person in the lead was an old man with pure white hair. He looked to be around sixty, and since Qiu Yuan looked to be twenty something, it was clear that this city lord only received his son at an old age.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>No wonder Qiu Yuan’s like this. He was probably extra spoiled.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Yuan’er, are you okay?” the old city lord’s face was filled with worry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Ye Zichen could see that the following mounts were pulling several boxes with spiritual seals on them, which should be the ransom they had prepared to get Qiu Yuan back with.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, I’m alright. I just got slapped by Ma Teng once. I’m fine everywhere else,” Qiu Yuan replied with a smile, then pointed at Ye Zichen and Zuo Mo, who just had dismounted the carriage. “Let me introduce you, these are friends I met at the bandits’ place. It was all thanks to them that I could get free this time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“City Lord Qiu!” Ye Zichen and Zuo Mo called out together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The old city lord also walked over with a thankful smile, “Thanks to you two, my son’s life is unharmed. How about staying at my city lord manor for a few days in order for me to repay your kindness?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uhm…” Ye Zichen was a bit hesitant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Ye, stop hesitating. Pond City’s security isn’t the best, and there are tons of bandits and highwaymen around here. What’s more, it’s already late. Just stay in the city for a night. If you are in a hurry, then just leave tomorrow morning!” Qiu Yuan advised.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The driver also called out, “Young Lady, the bandits just now too our earth dragon’s food, so it doesn’t have the stamina to run anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then we’ll be troubling you!” Zuo Mo and Ye Zichen replied together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pond City was in the extreme northern region of the Eastern Continent. Due to it being near the Endless Beast Region, and Mount Biluo was just outside the city, the people were extremely tough. They would begin to fight due to any tiny arguments. It could be said that the civilians were definitely as brave as soldiers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Ye, let me give a toast to you. It was all thanks to you that I could escape unscathed,” Qiu Yuan held up his glass.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled, then bumped his glass with Qiu Yuan’s before downing it. However, right after that, he used his spiritual energy to disperse the alcohol fro his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Due to being in a foreign place, he needed to remain conscious at all times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn’t expect the two of you to be from Maple City. Pond City is at the very edge of the Eastern Continent. Did you pass by here to go to the Endless Beast Region?” The old city lord asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shook his head with a smile, “No, we’re headed to Mount Biluo!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mount Biluo?” The old city lord’s expression drastically changed, then he raised his eyebrows. “Mount Biluo is not a good place. The reason you guys are going there…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen merely smiled in response.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dad, what are you asking!? Brother Ye and co. saved me, and saved you tons of money. Yet, you’re actually asking this and that,” Qiu Yuan frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The old city lord snorted, “Isn’t that because you’re a disappointment? As the city lord’s son, you get kidnapped by bandits every few days. You truly make me lose all my face.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk…” Qiu Yuan twitched his mouth, then threw his chopsticks onto the table. “Here you go again. I told you I dislike cultivation. Alright, I’m done. Brother Ye, I’ll take you guys to the guests’ rooms!”</span></p>

 <p></p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Earth Traveler Sun?</p>
 <p><strong>Ma Teng:&nbsp;</strong>Yeah, my master is the almighty Earth Traveler Sun! So, how dare you insult him so! Master, he was so full of himself when he was insulting you! He didn't take you seriously at all!</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>...</p>
 <p><strong>Earth Traveler Sun:&nbsp;</strong>Brat, I will teach you a lesson right now! (cracks knuckles) Don't. Ever. Insult...</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Uhm... Earth Traveler Sun, you're a deity aren't you? Why did you end up being a bandit instead?</p>
 <p><strong>Earth Traveler Sun:&nbsp;</strong>Ahem...</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Also, you're friends with Yang Jian, right? He's my bro, you know?</p>
 <p><strong>Ma Teng:&nbsp;</strong>Tsk, do you think my master is going to fall for a simple lie like that one?</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>I can show you proof. Just untie me first, and I'll show it to you.</p>
 <p><strong>Ma Teng:&nbsp;</strong>Master, don't! He's really strange! He can turn himself tiny into a fly or something! What if he escapes when you untie him!?</p>
