 <p><span style>Chapter 205 – False Marriage String</span></p>
 <p><span style>The tables had turned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Le gulped in shock and didn’t dare to look back. Meanwhile, Zhuge Kongming’s face brightened up and dispelled the barrier in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen-ge.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Zichen!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Le’s expression tensed. He had heard Zhuge Kongming mention this name before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t pay attention to the name back then, since he could do whatever he wants with two Spiritual Body attendants by his side in the Modern Realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, those two hulks had sent his attendants flying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brat, say it, why did you come to trash my place?” Ye Zichen walked past Gu Le with a chuckle, then walked in front of Zhuge Kongming to rub his head. “Little fellow, I knew you weren’t a normal person.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe,” Zhuge Kongming smiled coyly and scratched his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brat, these are matters between us, the Gu clan and the Zhuge family. You better not butt into it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One of the Hou brothers slapped the attendant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How are you speaking to our Boss Ye!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Late stage Spiritual Body level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The attendant immediately shut his mouth, while Gu Le’s face darkened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was wary about this Ye Zichen, whose identity was unknown… However, slapping his attendant’s face in front of him… Isn’t that just face-slapping him?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother, you are not quite right when you’re doing this, right!!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what do you think is right?” Ye Zichen squinted his eyes and smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Gu Tian also ran over, “Gu Le, why did you come?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gu Tian!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two glared at each other as the smell of fire powder spread through the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Brothers of the Gu clan!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s more, from the looks of it, they were rivals.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I naturally came to find you to call you back to the clan…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Le instantly swept his gaze over Gu Tian and Ye Zichen, causing his dark expression to turn even more sullen…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gu Tian, shouldn’t you give me an explanation?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The heck are you, why should I explain it to you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Tian rolled his eyes at Gu Le, then walked in front of Ye Zichen. When Gu Tian saw Zhuge Kongming, he even nodded and smiled towards the little fellow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Ye, I’m really sorry…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled helplessly, “What does that have to do with you? The one who failed to appreciate kindness is that grandson, I won’t drag you in.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brat…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Gu Le, who was behind them, was about to speak, Third Hou and Fourth Hou had already appeared by his side…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Le smiled coyly, then swallowed what he was about to say.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“From the looks of it, you aren’t the only retard in your clan,” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes at Gu Tian in annoyance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Tian replied speechlessly, “Brother Ye, I’m stubborn, he’s a retard, we’re different.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ugh.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>He actually spoke about his kin like that, it seems like their relationship is like oil and water.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled, then nodded, “Then do you have to return with him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm, I have to return,” Gu Tian nodded. “The succession to the junior family head is about to begin. As one of the main family, I have to return and see, when that happens, I’ll have to rely on Brother Ye helping me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem,” after getting Ye Zichen’s confirmation, Gu Tian stopped worrying and walked to Gu Le’s side. “Let’s go, my cute elder clan brother.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the Gu family members left, Ye Zichen turned around with a wry smile, and smiled at Zhuge Kongming, who was playing with his fingers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little fellow, you truly tricked your Zichen-ge, so, so much!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Zhuge Kongming looked up and stuck out his tongue with a smile, “At the start, I didn’t know Zichen-ge was also someone from our place. Even if I told you, you won’t believe it…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, then why didn’t you say that earlier?” Ye Zichen swept his gaze over Zhuge Kongming meaningfully, then glanced at Blackie, “Blackie, you’re a ghost that I brought back personally…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Ye, my heart is definitely with you,” Blackie saluted. Ye Zichen glanced over them with a meaningful smile, then walked into the supermarket.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen-ge…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Enough, I’m not blaming you,” Ye Zichen rubbed his head. “Since you are someone of the hidden families, and you have an infant engagement with Xia Keke, doesn’t that mean…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm, she is as well.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wow!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sighed.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>No wonder neither Xia Keke nor Zhuge Kongming found it weird that the Great Sage came.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I had thought that Xia Keke was merely insensitive…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It seems like I’m the insensitive person here.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The more he knew, the more Ye Zichen felt like his brain wasn’t enough. He let out a long sigh, then pushed his feelings down in his heart, before brightening up, “Go and take out all of the spicy gluten in our shop.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t mind so much. Hurry up!” Ye Zichen kicked Zhuge Kongming on the butt. Thus, both Zhuge Kongming and Blackie went to the storage to move spicy gluten packages.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the Moon Palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chang’e held her phone tightly. She had remained like that for a long time in order to receive the spicy gluten that Ye Zichen would send at the very first possible moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Buzz.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her phone vibrated.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Spicy gluten!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Chang’e’s eyes lit up and quickly received the red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received Sky Sovereign’s red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shooooo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A pile of spicy gluten instantly appeared in the Moon Palace. It had piled up to the size of a small mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bunny, our good days have come.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing these, the Jade Rabbit also turned into her human form, then started to munch after grabbing a packet. Meanwhile, Chang’e couldn’t help but gulp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it wasn’t because she cared about her image, she might have done the same as the Jade Rabbit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, when she thought about courtesy, she still picked up her phone and replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you, Sky Sovereign.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingodng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your intimacy level with Chang’e increased by 50. Current intimacy level 200.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Intimacy level leveled up. Current intimacy level Trusted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows and smiled when he saw Chang’e’s reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is what Fairy deserves. If Fairy finishes all these spicy glutens, come find me. This sovereign said that from now on, fairy’s spicy glutens will all be on this sovereign.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chang’e’s heart was moved when she saw the message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received False Marriage String x1.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Current Possessor: Fairy Chang’e. Possessed: Only Idealism.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the heck is a False Marriage String?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, this marriage string had a lot of places that were different from before. He wasn’t the possessor, and his name isn’t on the possessed side, instead, it was his nickname.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Very strange.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen looked back onto Fairy Chang’e’s chat, he noticed that the color of their intimacy level had changed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Normally, it was green, but his intimacy level with Chang’e had turned pink.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In order to ensure that it wasn’t something wrong with his phone, he deliberately took a glance at his intimacy level with other people.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>No change.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Damn, was he on the way to pick up a fairy?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>If Houyi finds out…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>That was a guy that dared to shoot down the suns, if he knows… Then wouldn’t I get shot to death!</span></i></p>
 <p></p>
