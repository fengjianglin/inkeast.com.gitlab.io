 <p><span style>Chapter 87 – The information that Ye Rong revealed</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You really are irresponsible,” Liu Qing floated beside Ye Zichen with a look of disdain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen extinguished the cigarette in his hand on the trash can beside him, then stretched lazily and smacked her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you know?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Rong was his mom. How could he, the son, not understand her?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The best way to deal with it was for Xiao Yumei and his mom to chat alone. His being there would only make the situation more awkward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk, what are you pretending for,” Liu Qing twitched her mouth at Ye Zichen’s back, then floated beside him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen put his hands on his waist as he looked at the endless gravel path. It seems like Lil’ White really had developed a wild side to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was actually not standing guard at home and ran outside to play.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was definitely going to teach Lil’ White a good lesson when he finds him. At that moment, a poodle, holding its head up high, appeared alongside a group of dogs all several times his size on the gravel path.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen glanced over. Who else could the poodle be in the lead be if not for Lil’ White?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil White.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen called. Hearing that, the poodle immediately looked up excitedly, and ran over with its tongue out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, you’re finally back. I’ve been starving these past few days.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ White stuck out its tail and kept on rubbing his head against the corner of Ye Zichen’s trousers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his hand and slapped Lil’ White’s head. This slap instantly called Lil’ White to roll over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the dogs following Lil’ White yelped, then leaped towards Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ White immediately jumped up and blocked off the path, as he started to bark at them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are they saying?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, the translator, Liu Qing, had to speak up. She raised her eyebrows and smiled, “These dogs all seems to be Lil’ White’s subordinates. He’s scolding them right now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As expected, not long later, Lil’ White ran beside Ye Zichen’s leg to rub his head happily once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, the dogs that were looking at him with murderous gazes just now all acted like pups as they sat on the ground with their tongues out and looked at them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kick.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye ZIchen kicked Lil’ White then said with a smile unlike a smile, “Wow, you’re living a pretty good life. You already know how to accept lackeys.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s all to serve boss.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ White raised his paws in an attempt to salute, but he was unable to lift it that high, causing his action to look completely ridiculous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Ye Zichen brought Lil’ White back to the mansion. Before going back, Lil’ White did remember to tell his subordinates to return to their homes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mom, I found Lil’ White.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen returned to the mansion with Lil’ White in tow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mother Ye sighed helplessly when she saw Ye Zichen. It seems like the two women pretty much finished chatting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You,” Mother Ye shook her head, stood up from the sofa and walked to the kitchen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen quickly sat onto the sofa. Xiao Yumei’s face was still a bit red, as if she wasn’t completely over their conversation just now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did mom say to you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not much, she just kept on praising you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, she truly is my mom.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei did not stay after dinner. Instead, she returned to her own home.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen actually wanted to get her to stay, but Xiao Yumei insisted on leaving, so he didn’t force her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When night came.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sat in the living room and watched variety shows. Tiantian and Lil’ White were tired after a day of playing, so Mother Ye sent them back to their room to sleep.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, Ye Rong, who was in pajamas, sat down beside Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, tell mom, is that girl called Xiao Yumei…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was coming finally came. Ye Zichen licked his lips and nodded without denying anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what about that child Su Yan? I can tell that she also likes you a lot.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you want to do? Which one of the two are you going to give up?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen hesitated for a moment, then smiled helplessly, “Mom, if I tell you that I don’t want to give up on either of them, would you think that your son is very scummy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How could I? You’re my son, how could a mother speak ill about her son?” Ye Rong caressed Ye Zichen’s hair. “I’m just worried. Both Xiao Yumei and Su Yan are good girls. They shouldn’t know about each other’s existences, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I knew it was like this,” Mother Ye sighed. “You’re grown up now, so mom wouldn’t manage you so much. But just one thing, don’t betray the feelings these two children have towards you. Don’t be like your dad…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What about my dad?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen turned his head in shock. Mother Ye quickly stopped herself and stood up from the sofa.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m worried about Tiantian being alone in the room. I’m going back. You should get some rest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mom, about my dad…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What he got in response was the merciless sound of a door closing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sat down on the sofa limply and lit a cigarette for himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had never known who his father was. He has always been brought up by his mother, and he also used his mother’s surname.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So many years had passed, his desire to know who his father is had already decreased.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite that, Mother Ye’s sentence just now did attract Ye Zichen’s attention.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen thought back to his mother’s tone and what she said before and after it.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Did that man betray his mom?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thinking that, Ye Zichen’s fist couldn’t help but clench.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it really was like this, he will definitely make that man pay.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Three days later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hai-ge, there is no need to make it so grand, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but smile wryly as he looked at the brand new Porsche 918 parked beside him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A while ago, he had casually mentioned to Xiao Hai that he will go to a reunion with Su Yan, and it seems like there was going to be rich people there, so he wanted to borrow a car.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Xiao Hai directly brought the 918 back to him without saying anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you mean, grand? Wasn’t this originally your car? The 4S store told me to retrieve it a while ago, I just never got around to doing it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Hai laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s no need to drive the 918, right? It’s too high profile. You have so many cars, it’s fine if you lend me an Audi or BMW.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled wryly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Xiao Hai scolded in frustration, “Too young! Too naïve! Do you think that a reunion is just a gathering of old classmates to chit chat? Why do the classmates gather? Basically, it’s just for the amazing ones to show off in front of the others, and for the others to act like grandsons in front of the amazing ones in order to get into contact with them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Although you’re not Su Yan’s classmate, don’t forget your identity. You’re her boyfriend. Young Mistress Su Yan is Old Man Su’s darling, if you seem too stingy, wouldn’t that lose face for Young Mistress Su?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Hai instructed him like someone who has experienced all this. Ye Zichen sighed and wanted to tell Hai-ge some truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But when he saw the other person’s passionate look, he stopped himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, I understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I knew that you brat would get it after I mention it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Hai laughed and patted Ye Zichen’s shoulders. He seemed as excited as it was him going to a reunion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen could only smile wryly.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So what if he drove a 918? The car can’t be driven into the room, who knows whose it is!</span></i></p>
