 <p><span style>Chapter 133 – I don’t need your luck</span></p>
 <p><span style>The night passed by quietly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the next morning, Mother Ye sent Tiantian to the kindergarten.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since there wasn’t anyone in the mansion, Ye Zichen also started to busy himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was absolutely determined to revive Liu Qing. Although the treasures needed were pretty hard to find, this was unable to become the reason for Ye Zichen to do nothing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had no chance to meet Immortal Lady He.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was also in a cold war with Old Lord Taishang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only thing he could do at the moment seemed to be getting the dragon eye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Speaking of dragon slaying, the Third Price was definitely a professional. He might be able to get a dragon eye of a thousand years of cultivation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Third Prince, Third Prince!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it, Sky Sovereign?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Third Prince’s moe display picture flashed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Third Prince has slayed plenty of dragons, right!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course!” When it came to dragon slaying. If Nezha said that he was number two, no one would dare to admit that they were number one. “I have slayed at least eight hundred dragons, if not a thousand. But why is the Sky Sovereign asking about this!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This sovereign wants to ask for a dragon eye of a thousand years of cultivation from the Third Prince.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thousand years of cultivation,” Third Prince Nezha hesitated for a moment, then replied. “I don’t think I’ve slayed a dragon that has a thousand years of cultivation experience.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s heart instantly turned a bit cold after seeing this message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If even Nezha didn’t have it, then it was definitely impossible to find a dragon eye of a thousand years of cultivation in the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh yeah, when I entered the group, I sent a dragon out. That dragon had a thousand years of cultivation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Third Prince Nezha suddenly replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen subconsciously touched the dragon eye in his pocket.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You said that dragon had a thousand year of cultivation!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah,” Third Prince Nezha replied. “If Sky Sovereign needs it, I can help you ask who got the dragon eye.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need, the dragon eye is with me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen quickly replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm, that dragon eye is one with a thousand year of cultivation. Sky Sovereign, is there anything else?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It seems like Third Prince Nezha still wanted to go back to sleep. </span></i><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows and asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Third Prince, who has Nine Heart Lotus Roots!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nine Heart Lotus Roots,” The Third Prince hesitated for a moment, before replying. “I don’t have any. The Heavenly Court probably doesn’t have any treasure like this, but Auntie Immortal Lady He of the Eight Immortals might have it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then can the Third Prince help me ask for it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can’t, I’m not really familiar with the Eight Immortals. It seems like I’m unable to help Sky Sovereign.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay, I understand. Third Prince, just go back to sleep.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had a thousand year dragon eye in his hand, but he could only get a Nine Heart Lotus Root from Immortal Lady He.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the none of the Eight Immortals doesn’t seem to be in the Heavenly Court’s WeChat group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, someone seems to have come to find you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ White ran into the room as it stuck out its tongue. Thus, Ye Zichen put down his phone and looked out from the window.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A black Bentley was parked outside the courtyard, while Zu Siliang stood in the courtyard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did this brat come?” Ye Zichen squinted his eyes. Then he very quickly thought of a certain possibility as he revealed a faint smile at the corner of his mouth, while shaking his head. “Watch the place properly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood!” Lil’ White wagged its tail. “No one will be able to enter with me here. What’s more, if it really isn’t okay, I still have a bunch of underlings, right!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re amazing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rubbed Lil’ White’s head a few times before walking out of the mansion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the series of events that occurred the previous night, a hint of respect had appeared from the Zu Siliang’s gaze towards Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a feeling that would only exist when he was treated as an opponent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yang Zhen told you to come find me, right? He’s still so arrogant…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zu Siliang didn’t think that Ye Zichen could guess it so easily, so he merely nodded with a smile, “Indeed, Uncle Yang told me to come get you. He’s accompanying Yushi in the hospital, so…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t find excuses for him, do you believe what you’re saying?” Ye Zichen snorted. “I think you should know better than me what sort of person he is.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“About this…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zu Siliang stopped. He was indeed clear. If there was no surprise…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Zhen should still be talking business in the hospital!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, stop wasting my time. Bring me over to have a look. I do want to see whether Yang Zhen can get more caring after this event.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then let’s go,” Zu Siliang also laughed softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within the First People’s Hospital’s special ward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Several tens of bodyguards in black suits stood along the wall in two rows. All of the medical staff couldn’t help but gulp when they walked past there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no helping it, it truly was a bit too terrifying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Zhen did not care about his daughter within the ward like other fathers, even after knowing that she was hurt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His phone calls never stopped from the moment he entered the ward. He had been busy making money.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Yushi was already used to this sort of situation. She wore a hospital gown as she read the latest fashion magazine, it was as if Yang Zhen was not in the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were like strangers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was something that perfectly described them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Yang Zhen finally finished the call, he hung up with a frown, as if the phone call did not go as he wished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yushi…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just when he was about to speak up, the phone in hand rang again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Zhen looked at his phone, while Yang Yushi put her fashion magazine to the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can you take the call outside? I want to rest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you blaming me?” Yang Zhen ignored the ringing phone in his hand and replied. “Everything I’m doing right now is for you, for your future.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not denying it, am I?” Yang Yushi said with self-mockery as she slowly pulled up her blanket. “For me, it’s all for me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t mess around, why don’t you understand me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dad, you’re saying I’m messing around?” Yang Yushi, who was covered by the blanket, suddenly sat up and said with tearful eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you know I nearly died yesterday? But what did you do after coming here? Making calls, talking business. You have come to visit my ward for more than six hours. Have you even cared about me with a single phrase? In your eyes, is business more important than me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t this for you? Isn’t the money I earn going to be left for you? The Zu family is a large family, if I don’t work hard to make enough dowry for you, what if you get bullied by in the Zu family?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t like Zu Siliang at all!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Say that again!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Zhen’s face suddenly looked like a thundercloud.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I said I don’t like Zu Siliang!” Yang Yushi screamed as her tears begun to flow uncontrollably. “I don’t like everything you organized for me. I don’t want the so-called happiness you left for me, I don’t want it at all! Alright, your client is looking for you. Please go out, I have to rest!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Blasphemy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Zhen raised his hand to hit her, while Yang Yushi sat there without dodging and stared straight at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the very moment when Yang Zhen’s hand was going to fall down, a powerful hand grabbed his wrist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Enough, Yang Zhen, let’s go out to talk.”</span></p>
