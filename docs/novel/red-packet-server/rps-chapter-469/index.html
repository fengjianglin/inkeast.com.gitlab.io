 <p><span style>Chapter 469 – Xue Lan Gets Married</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Never mind getting the Barrier Breaking Pill from Yang Jian. My bro clearly needed the pill because he’s about to breakthrough into the Sky Immortal level from the Human Immortal level.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It seems like if I want a Barrier Breaking Pill, then I have to find some Barrier Breaking Grass to give to Old Lord Taishang.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I’ll find you when I find some Barrier Breaking Grass.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, then we’ll talk then.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Ye Zichen quit WeChat, he sat on the bed in the room and blanked out. </span><i><span style>Barrier Breaking Grass, where am I supposed to get that.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Something that can ignore the barriers stopping a person from breakthrough should be a treasure, right? Then I don’t even have to think about finding it in a normal herb shop.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Zichen,” the door to Ye Zichen’s room was pushed open, and Xue Lan ran in from the outside with a giggle wearing a white flowered dress.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During this period of time, all of the Spiritual Breeze Villagers had already moved into the manor they had bought in the city. They had already given up on the lode. To nobody’s surprise, the news of the black crystal ore had been leaked, and in less than three hours after the last villager left, several clans had arrived at the place of their village, making it very fortunate that all of the villagers had departed already.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened?” Ye Zichen returned his phone to his pocket and stretched lazily, before rubbing Xue Lan on her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During this passage of time, the little girl had become more and more intimate with him, and would often go over to his room several times a day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother said we’re going out to eat, so he told me to call you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everyone in the village?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xue Lan shook her head, “No, just Lil’ Yu-jiejie, Stone-gege, you and I!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That’s a little bit strange.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Xue Qi is definitely not the kind of person who would leave the villagers out when there are good things, but he said that we’re going out to eat with only the few of us…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, let’s go!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen jumped off the bed, then followed Lil’ Lan out of the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, inside a certain high-class restaurant in the city… Xue Qi decisively ordered an entire table of dishes worth five hundred celeste. However, what was surprising was that Lil’ Yu actually did not stop him, while Stone maintained a soft smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uhm… Isn’t this a bit too luxurious?” Ye Zichen understood just how hard it was to earn celeste, if it was compared to the Modern Realm’s money…</span></p>
 <p><span style>One celeste was essentially a hundred yuan, and five hundred celeste was essentially fifty thousand yuan!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t get it,” Stone patted Ye Zichen’s shoulder, then glanced towards Lil’ Lan, who maintained a moe smile as she put her fingers on her lips and blinked at the dishes on the table. “Actually, Lil’ Lan is getting married next week. We’re going to send her over after eating. Xue Qi’s sending Lil’ Lan off.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows in confusion. At this moment, Xue Lan also turned around with a giggle. </span><i><span style>So it looks like she already knows everything.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“So it’s like that!” Ye Zichen nodded with a smile, then patted Lil’ Lan’s head before using his chopstick to put some food into her plate. “Eat more.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>From start to finish, the meal was not in an extremely joyous atmosphere, and that was especially true for Xue Qi, who maintained a terrible expression. On the other hand, Xue Lan was giggling the entire time, even though she had never seen her soon-to-be groom before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the entrance of the restaurant, Xue Qi held Xue Lan’s hand and waved farewell to everyone. At that moment, Lil’ Yu could no longer hold back her tears, while Ye Zichen also licked his lips and walked over to pat Xue Lan’s head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If those people bully you, then tell Zichen-ge, Zichen-ge will help you beat them up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay,” Lil’ Lan giggled in response.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ Yu couldn’t help but twitch her mouth, “Even the outer disciples of the Azure Sky Pavilion are at least of the spiritual body level. I heard that Lil’ Yu’s groom is already an inner disciple, so he should be at least at the False Earth Immortal level, you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What about me? I’ll fight him even if I can’t beat him. I won’t let anyone bully my lil’ sister,” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xue Lan giggled, “Zichen-gege is still the one who treats me the best.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They chatted a bit more before Xue Qi left with Xue Lan. While they were leaving, Xue Lan would keep turning back and waving towards Ye Zichen and co…</span></p>
 <p><span style>During that, Lil’ Yu continuously wiped away her tears. Xue Lan was like a little sister that she had watched grow up, so she really doesn’t want her to just leave like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright now, Lil’ Lan getting married there is a good marriage. Why are you crying?” Stone patted Lil’ Yu’s shoulder, with a bit of tears in his eyes as well. Since she was a kid that he also watched grow up, it was impossible for him to not be sad.</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>“C’mon, let’s go back and wait for Xue Qi to come and give us candy<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>!” Stone dragged Lil’ Yu by the arm and begun to walk back.</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>However, two men suddenly appeared in front of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, what a coincidence. We meet again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The people who appeared in front of them was no other than the man who Ye Zichen said looked like a sissy, and his little brother.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stone, you two go on back first. No need to mind me,” Ye Zichen gaze Stone and Lil’ Yu a gaze indicating for them not to worry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, after watching them walk off, Ye Zichen squinted his eyes with a frown, “Why are you always around like a specter? What exactly do you want from me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you mean what do I want? Is this city yours? You really say that I’m not permitted to walk wherever I want?” The sissy man spoke in a rather feminine manner, causing Ye Zichen to get irritated upon hearing his voice….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Seriously… Fine, if I can’t deal with you, then I’ll avoid you,” with that, Ye Zichen begun to walk to the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the feminine man chased after him and stopped him, “The city is so big, so us meeting thrice is fate as well. Do you not want to know my name?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“To be honest, I really don’t,” Ye Zichen twitched his mouth coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The feminine youth’s little brother couldn’t help but laugh. From what he could recall this was his first time watching his brother hit a wall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The feminine youth smacked his little brother’s head, then rolled his eyes, “Laugh, laugh, laugh it out. Just try laughing once again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahem…” the youth coughed a bit more, then forced himself to stop laughing and turned to Ye Zichen. “Bro, if you don’t want to listen to him speak, then I’ll speak. Let me introduce myself, I’m called Zuo Liang, and this sissy guy you talked about is Zuo Mo!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What does that have to do with me!?” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes, then glanced towards the sissy…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Zuo Mo </span></i><span style>[2. The character’s name is Zuo Mo (左茉), which is completely homophonic with Zuo Mo(</span><span style>左莫), the main character of World of Cultivation.]</span><i><span style>!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Zeze, he completely wasted this name!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, why are you so despicable? How rude!” Zuo Mo pouted unhappily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, Ye Zichen immediately felt disgusted and nearly vomited the food he just ate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where you acting coquettishly!?” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes speechlessly when he finally stopped his urge to vomit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who-Who was acting coquettishly with you!?” Zuo Mo frantically played with his fingers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, Ye Zichen instantly wanted to break down, “What exactly do you want? Can you stop making me suffer!?”</span></p>
