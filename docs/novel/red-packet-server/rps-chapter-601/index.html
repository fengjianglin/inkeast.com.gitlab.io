 <p><span style>Chapter 601 – Bribery and Threats</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen fell into silence when he saw the message.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Someone would have protected me in the hall…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Who could it be!?</span></i><a href="http://volarenovels.com/red-packet-server/rps-chapter-602/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The only possibility he could think of was Su Yiyun. However, he quickly erased that thought. </span><i><span style>If it was Ol’ Three from before, he might do that, but now, he’s the Formation Grandmaster of the Demon Realm.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>He&nbsp;is no longer the him of the past.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Never mind, I don’t want to know who that person is. Oh, I heard about the ley line from Black Dragon. Do you know what that is?” Ye Zichen asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: The Ley Line is the heart of the Three Realms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Explain it properly so I can understand,” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: The Ley Line can be described as the node tying the Upper Three Reams and Lower Three Realms together. The Jade Emperor of the Heavenly Court and the Great Sacred Emperor Equaling Heaven of the Underworld had already reached a level where they could ascend over ten thousand years ago. The reason there was no tribulation for them to ascend is mainly because this ‘heart’ of the Three Realms was sealed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did the Yellow Emperor seal it back then?” Ye Zichen frowned as he considered the information.</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: It’s so that those of the Upper Three Realms would be unable to easily torment those of the Lower Three Realms. You might not know, but those of the Lower Three Realms are essentially insects in the eyes of the ones in the Upper Three Realms. Countless clans were harmed in the Endless Beast Realm, and the strongest amongst them were captured as pets. The better-looking men and women merely became their sex toys. The Yellow Emperor went and searched for the Ley Line because he could not accept all that anymore. He used the Great Technique of the Stars to seal it. Xuan-Yuan Xiang knows all of that. You can just ask her about it later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded. </span><i><span style>If I was faced with that sort of situation, I might have done the same.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait, no! I’m clearly the reincarnation of the Yellow Emperor, why do you seem to know even more than me!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: Who knows...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing the system give such an ambiguous answer, Ye Zichen merely squinted his eyes and put it aside for the moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what should I do after these three days. Black Dragon wants to know about where the ley line is, and he is certain that I know where it is. If I don’t tell him, then he’ll torture me to death. What do you think I should do?”</span><a href="http://volarenovels.com/red-packet-server/rps-chapter-602/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: I know, but I can’t tell you.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re f*cking screwing me over,” Ye Zichen cursed the system with a glare.</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: This isn’t the time for the ley line to be shown to the world yet. Just do what you’re supposed to do these coming days. We’ll see about the rest later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, before Ye Zichen could form a reply, the system notifications began to disappear.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Judging from my past experience of chatting with the system, the guy doesn’t want to talk anymore.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He chucked his phone to the side bitterly. </span><i><span style>Ahh, although the system seems unreliable, the only choice I have is to rely on it.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who!?” Su Yiyun, who was within a spiritual stone filled room and figuring out spiritual formations, looked up vigilantly, then instantly put up several defensive formations in the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A figure walked out of the corner of the room. It passed through the formation seals without any problems, and sat down on a chair near Su Yiyun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Black Dragon will execute Ye Zichen three days later. Please help me delay it for a while.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What a joke. The Yellow Emperor is the arch nemesis of our Demon Realm. You want me to help you delay it for some time? Don’t be delusional,” Su Yiyun laughed coldly. “Who are you to act so outrageously here. Hurry up and leave, otherwise, I’ll kill you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve been occupied with some matters recently, so I can’t spare the effort to come around. I might not be able to arrive the moment Black Dragon decides to execute him. I’ll leave everything to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, the black figure slowly disappeared from the room once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun watched the figure leave with a dark look. At the same time, a squad of demon guards also arrived outside his room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lord Su, was it you who shouted just now...?”</span><a href="http://volarenovels.com/red-packet-server/rps-chapter-602/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Go patrol elsewhere. I was just seeing things,” Su Yiyun replied faintly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After sending the guards away, he shook his head and looked down, only to find the formation he was working on for more than half a month had already been completed. </span><i><span style>Just who was that!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Three days passed in the blink of an eye, and Ye Zichen arrived at the Demon Dragon Palace once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon was smiling as if spring had come once more. He had waited for this moment for far too long. It was the day the ley line was going to be shown to the world once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason that he was so certain was because he refused to believe Ye Zichen would rather die.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little friend Ye, long time no see. Have you gotten used to living in our demon realm?”</span><a href="http://volarenovels.com/red-packet-server/rps-chapter-602/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s alright,” Ye Zichen smiled. “Lord Black Dragon should know that I have the blood of demons within me as well, so I don’t have an issue with the demonic energy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I actually forgot that little friend Ye is a Fallen! It seems like you are fated to be with us demons. I promise right now that as long as you tell me the location of the ley line, you will gain the position of the Demonic Son.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Everybody was shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The position of the Demonic Son was incomparable, and which is essentially equal to that of Black Dragon’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Li clenched his fists sullenly. </span><i><span style>Even I, the reincarnation of Chiyou, did not end up in that position, the reincarnation of the Yellow Emperor actually…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Demonic Son. Wow, that sounds rather cool,” Ye Zichen chuckled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon smiled at Ye Zichen’s reaction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Naturally. The Demonic Son is a supreme existence amongst the Demon Realm. Even I would have to treat you with respect. What’s more, the entire Demon Realm would be yours in the future. Little friend Ye, you have to remember, the Demon Realm is one of the Upper Three Realms. Think about just how glorious it would be for you to become the master of one of the Upper Three Realms!” With that, Black Dragon smiled once again. “If you want, then everything in the Demon Realm would be yours. Everybody in the Demon Realm would have to obey you. You can also bring your friends and family over. You would be king here, no one would dare to defy you. But… If you don’t tell me, then you should know just how merciless the Demon Realm is. You, and your women, your family, your friends, and everyone who has been in contact with you would die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then if I want Gu Li to commit suicide, he has to do that as well?” Ye Zichen glanced at Gu Li.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course,” Black Dragon answered without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Li clenched his fists tightly under the cover of his robe. If Ye Zichen truly becomes the master of the Demon Realm, then he would have no place in the Demon Realm any more.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I have to stop him…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Lord Black Dragon!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shut up!” Black Dragon’s eyes gleamed with coldness. “This is no place for you to speak.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Li lowered his head sullenly. Black Dragon also revealed a warm smile towards Ye Zichen, “I wonder what do you think? The location of the ley line…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The location of the ley line…” Ye Zichen smiled naughtily and raised his eyebrows. Everyone in the hall looked towards him, and Black Dragon’s eyes were actually filled with clear interest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He has already been at the complete stage for too long. He wanted to become stronger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sealed ley line was the only thing stopping him. He had to find the ley line.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where is it!?” Black Dragon interrogated Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smirked and said, “I don’t know!”</span></p>
 <p></p>

 <p>Someone. Would. Have. Protected. Me.</p>
 <p>Someone... would have protected me...</p>
 <p>Someone...</p>
 <p>What!?</p>
 <p>Who!?</p>
 <p>Ol' Three?</p>
 <p>No,&nbsp;that's impossible. He's too far gone. Even though I want to convince myself that he isn't too far gone, and he's still the same as he was before... Even I can't believe that anymore after all he has done.</p>
 <p>But... If not him, then who? Does the system have a spy amongst the demons?</p>
 <p>Hah,&nbsp;or is the system going to tell me that it's Gu Li!? Pfft, that's impossible, he's the one who wants me dead the most.</p>
 <p>Hmmm, maybe that Black Dragon guy just doesn't want to kill me? Is that who the system was talking about?</p>
 <p>I suppose that must be it,&nbsp;because I really can't think of anyone who would protect me.</p>
