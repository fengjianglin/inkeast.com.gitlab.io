 <p><span style>Chapter 2 – Does it feel good to be smacked by money</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yao Yue, I want to see you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stood outside the girl’s dormitory, while holding two suitcases.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We already have no relationship to each other, can you not… Aiya, Qiang-ge, don’t mess around…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The panting coming from the other side of the phone caused Ye Zichen’s expression to turn terrifyingly dark. However, once he looked at the suitcases in his hands, a smirk once again appeared on the corner of his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s the last time, I just want to give you a present…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Present! Just wait a bit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen only saw Yao Yue walk out of the girl’s dormitory after a good half an hour.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the flushed look on Yao Yue’s face, it seems like the two people had just enjoyed themselves not too long ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For some reason, Ye Zichen felt that he had been so stupid. He hadn’t even dared to hold Yao Yue’s hand after dating her for more than half a year.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The people at the dorm called him a coward, yet he had replied with a laugh and said that it was true love!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>True love!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>True love, what is true love!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What, you feel like the money Qiang-ge gave you wasn’t enough, so you want some more for your breakup fee?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yao Yue took a card out from her wallet and threw it at Ye Zichen with a laugh of contempt. The card fell onto the ground with a sound that induced heartbreak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Here’s ten thousand, Qiang-ge said to stay away from me in the future.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who was standing in place without moving, suddenly laughed. He playfully picked up the bank card on the floor and played around with it before throwing it back in Yao Yue’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You think you’re amazing because you have some money?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t be dumb when we’re trying to give you face...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yao Yue cursed him with a sullen expression, but stopped halfway when she saw Ye Zichen open his suitcases.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two suitcases that were full of money.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, there was a bit of problem with this money. This was underworld money that Ye Zichen had specifically spent twenty thousand kuai ordering at a funeral store.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just f*cking rich, right? Ah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen opened his eyes wide and casually threw out several stacks of money onto Yao Yue’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yao Yue had completely been stunned at the moment Ye Zichen opened the suitcases.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the students in the area surrounded them as they watched stacks of money get slapped onto Yao Yue’s face. </span></p>
 <p><span style>They had never actually seen someone using money to literally smash others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of them silently wondered which family’s young master Ye Zichen was for him to actually act in such an oppressing manner. Quite a few girls had already secretly memorized Ye Zichen’s face in their heart in order to try and find a chance to create a ‘coincidental meeting’.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You like money, right? Does it feel good to get smacked with money? Hehe, what the hell are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After pouring the suitcases of money onto Yao Yue’s head, Ye Zichen turned around to leave with an ice-cold expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the students in school saw the money covering the entire ground, they immediately started to get riled up as they fought over it. At this moment, Yao Yue also returned to her senses and shouted towards the surrounding students.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nobody move, this is laoniang’s money!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Ye Zichen’s roommates had all finished eating and returned to the dorm. There was even a box of food that they had brought back for Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why isn’t Fifth Bro’s number going through, he couldn’t have gone to commit suicide, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhu Yunbai was the youngest in the dorm. His words never went through his brain first, and so he had no filter for what he said. Hearing that, Kang Peng raised his hand and smacked his head, then cursed at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can’t you f*cking wish for something better.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What Ol’ Six said might just be possible. It’s not like you guys don’t know Ol’ Five’s personality. Don’t think about how he’s pretty cheerful normally, he was completely sincere towards Yao Yue.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Yu sighed lightly with a frown, while everyone else in the dorm turned silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How about calling the police?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The youngest Zhu Yunbai suggested. After thinking about it for a while, Kang Peng also nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s call the police!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait, look at what this is?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just when everyone was about to call the police.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huge, huge news…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhang Rui, who was on the top bunk, suddenly stuck his head out. He was Ol’ Three in the dorm, and wore a glasses frame without any lenses to affect a scholarly, elegant air. He was outwardly cold but passionate in private, and was yet the person that was most concerned with the gossip in the school.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s up?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kang Peng and co. went over, while Zhang Rui pointed at the title shown on his phone…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you see that. Some overbearing rich second-generation appeared in a shocking manner, he actually used money to smash someone at the girl’s dorm!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that from the doorway, Ye Zichen momentarily blanked. </span><i><span style>Aren’t they talking about me? Why is it on the school forum already?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh wow, he really is using money to smash people. This retard is too cocky,” Zhu Yunbai shouted and swore. “Laozi hates this sort of rich second-generation the most.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The surrounding people also nodded in agreement. The people in the dorm were all from normal families, what they hated most was this sort of young master that used their parents’ money to get pretentious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What rich second-generation, look at the person in the photos.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did everyone notice who the person was in the photo. All of a sudden, the dorm became terrifyingly quiet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems to be like Fifth Bro,” Zhu Yunbai swallowed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It really does seem like Ol’ Five…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t say, it really does.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kacha.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who had used money to smash someone, just casually walked into the dorm. The moment he entered the room, everyone surrounded Ye Zichen as if they saw a rare animal. Zhang Rui also jumped down from the bed and held the phone up to examine the photo carefully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ol’ Five, the person on here is you, right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Ye Zichen took the phone from Zhang Rui. When he saw that eye-catching title, he couldn’t help but shake his head and smile wryly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What rich second-generation, what I threw was f*cking underworld money.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Underworld money? Then why is there a bunch of people fighting over money in the photo?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I ordered it, it cost me quite a lot!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The people in the dorm exploded into chatter once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ol’ Five, you’re evil enough.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Yu gave a thumb up towards Yi Zichen. Using underworld money to slap people’s faces was very unlucky. This brat didn’t think that although Ye Zichen rather kept under the radar normally, when he turned bad, he would be really that bad.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen ignored them and walked to the side of his bed, then took out his phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He opened the deities’ WeChat group and saw that the fight between Erlang Shen and the Monkey King had already stopped. The deities were all chatting about stuff like how much cultivation they earned the previous month, or that they had to pass through a trial or something.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The miracle of the ingots had already made Ye Zichen feel the uniqueness of this group. He wasn’t an idiot, if he really couldn’t feel it, then he can just go and commit suicide.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could it be that it really is a group of deities?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Although it seemed rather unbelievable, it truly did happen to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing the praises of his brothers in the dorm, Ye Zichen touched the bank card in his pocket.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everyone, quiet down a bit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone in the dorm instantly quieted down. Ye Zichen raised up the bank card in his hand and smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In order to celebrate me successfully becoming single again, I’ll treat everyone to go out to eat at Latte.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The room went completely silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone in the door looked at him as if they were looking at a idiot, causing Ye Zichen to feel very uncomfortable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you guys looking at me like that for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi, when have you treated us to a meal? It’s already good enough when you don’t &nbsp;try to get a meal off us every time. I can’t be hearing things, right?” Bai Yu said with an expression of disbelief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I feel like Fifth Bro’s gone crazy,” Zhu Yunbai also shrugged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ol’ Five, I know you’re in a bad mood because you just broke up, but you don’t need to say this sort of crazy stuff, right. The cost of Latte is at least several tens of thousands, right?” As the big bro of the dorm, Kang Peng was a bit more rational in what he said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m just asking if you’re going or not,” Ye Zichen replied forcefully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Going.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone in the dorm answered together. </span><i><span style>Damn, aren’t you an idiot if you don’t go when someone’s treating you!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Then let’s start the night at Latte!”</span></p>
