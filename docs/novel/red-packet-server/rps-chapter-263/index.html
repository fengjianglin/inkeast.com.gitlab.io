 <p><span style>Chapter 263 – Buying a car</span></p>
 <p><span style>It could be said that Su Qian paid a huge importance on the pill in front of him, so Ye Zichen’s reply surprised him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened?” Ye Zichen sighed when he saw Old Man Su’s serious expression. “We can’t produce it at all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can’t produce it?” Old Man Su raised his eyebrows. “What? Is your medicine not up to standards and is harmful to the human body?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Elder Su, do you think I will produce a medicine like that?” Ye Zichen revealed a wry smile. “It passed all standards, and this medicine doesn’t have any side effects for the human body.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then why can’t you produce it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to produce it as well, but I need the paperwork!” Ye Zichen shrugged while putting on a look of helplessness. “Originally, the paperwork and stuff had been approved, and we were ready to start production, but then they were cancelled.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cancelled?” Old Man Su frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah!” Ye Zichen let out a long sigh, then told Old Man Su about Han Yu using his means to cancel their paperwork.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Man Su slapped the marble table, while his entire face turned beyond dark.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The heck!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Man Su did do some research on the effects of the medicine. It was able to quickly recover internal injuries. What’s more, if the special medicine would really have no side effects for the human body like Ye Zichen said…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>If it was to be made available to the military, it would be a huge blessing for the children on missions, allowing the death rate of those missions to decrease by quite a bit!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>The Han family’s brat actually voided the paperwork for a medicine like this!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>If it was put in a nice way, then Han Yu was just a bit childish, if it was put severely, then he was committing treason!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph, the Han family really seems to think that they can rule over Bingcheng by themselves!” Old Man Su cursed. “Lil’ Ye, don’t worry. I will report this medicine to the higher ups and give you paperwork from the military. This old man doesn’t believe that the Han family can stick their hands there!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen then left the Su household. Before he did, he heard Su Qian continuously making calls, probably in order to discuss with people higher up in the government or the military.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He took a taxi to a 4S store. There was no helping it, he really did need to buy a car, since taking a taxi everywhere was far too troublesome.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir, welcome.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment he entered, several sales clerks surrounded him. Ye Zichen nodded with a faint smile, and silently noted that the service there was really good…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as he decided to ask them where the medium-priced cars were, the sales clerks all walked away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uhm… Excuse me, where are the medium-priced business or private cars?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nobody answered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Ye Zichen felt slightly dissatisfied. </span><i><span style>Why were their service attitudes like this…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Can someone come over? I have come to take a look at cars!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his volumes. However, the sales clerks continued to chat in groups and ignored him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are there no living people in your shop?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you shouting for? Can’t you see that we’re busy?” A sales clerk frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There customer is standing right here, yet you guys are chatting over there. This is how you treat your customers?” Ye Zichen forcefully suppressed his anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Never mind, Lil’ Li, come over and take this gentleman to have a look at the cars so that he doesn’t file a complaint on our service attitude.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sales clerk that spoke up previously hooked her fingers at the baby-faced girl, who was wiping the floor. The girl lifted her hand to wipe away the sweat on her forehead, placed the towel back into the bathroom, then jogged over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hello sir, what sort of cars would you like to have a look at?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need to be so passionate. This guy can’t afford it at all. Even if he does buy any, it would be with a mortgage, so just do a simple reception for him,” the sales clerk mocked Ye Zichen once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s expression darkened even more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The baby-faced girl immediately tried to divert his attention when she saw his expression, “Sir, the cars over here are all medium and low tiered cars, they aren’t particularly expensive, so they are suitable for those that just started working, or university students that are getting ready to start their own company, what do you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need,” Ye Zichen shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, see that? He just came to look. He can’t even get a mortgage, so what are you wasting your time over there for!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen glared that the sales clerk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the sales clerk saw his gaze, instead of backing off, she put her hands on her hips, “What are you looking at? You’re not liking it now that I speak the truth?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m really curious about how someone like you can work here,” Ye Zichen shook his head with a chuckle, then turned to the baby-faced girl. “You guys have sell Panamera here, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!” The baby-faced girl nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bring me over to have a look!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The baby-faced sales clerk took Ye Zichen to where the Panamera were sold, while the sales clerk behind them couldn’t help but mock, “What’s the use of just satisfying your urge to have a look?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You better shut your stinky mouth!” Ye Zichen, who was suppressing his anger, pointed at the sales clerk and roared angrily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sales clerk wanted to retort, but when she saw the gold card that Ye Zichen took out…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although they were just the lowest level of sales clerk, they did have suitable observation skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style>People that held that sort of gold card could easily buy more than a Porsche, they were even able to buy the entire car dealership.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll take the Panamera and the Maserati Quattroporte together.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir, are you sure?” The baby-faced girl did not dare to receive the card. The bonus from selling those two cars was worth almost two years of her salary…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course! Go and prepare the contract!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After signing the contracts, Ye Zichen squinted his eyes and walked in front of the sales clerk with a particular nasty mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, she had gone limp…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re going to get screwed one day due to your stinky mouth,” Ye Zichen scolded, then drove the Panamera away from the 4S store, while he got the car dealership to get a person to drive the Quattroporte back to his mansion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long after he drove away, Ye Zichen’s phone suddenly rang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He stopped the car by the road, took out his phone to have a look at the messages, and saw that Taibai Jinxing was the one looking for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most importantly, that geezer seemed to be in a hurry…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing: Kid!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing: Come quickly!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing: This sovereign has important matters to discuss with you.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing: Can you hurry up? I’m really on the spot right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing: Only Idealism!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What is it? What’s he in such a hurry?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows, rubbed his nose, then replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it? Why are you in such a hurry? Also, I have my own daily life too, I can’t possibly service you 24 hours a day!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You finally came,” Taibai Jinxing let out a long sigh of relief, then looked at the mess of a school in front of him with a frown. “A problem has come up with the school established in the Heavenly Court!”</span></p>
