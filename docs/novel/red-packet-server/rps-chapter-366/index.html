<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p><span style>Chapter 366 – This is what you meant by authority?</span></p>
 <p><span style>His cocky tone made everyone in the cabin slightly displeased. Song An undoubtedly did have exceptional talent in the medical field, but saying his words were authority was slightly too much.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite that, most people just wanted the patient to be saved. The hearts of people were mostly kind, and nobody wanted to see someone die on a plane due to sudden health issues.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, most of it might have been because they didn’t want to see the flight delayed, or get forcefully transferred to another one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The passengers did not have any medical knowledge, but Ye Zichen did.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he never expected Song An would be so prideful as to just suddenly say that his words were authority, then ignore his warning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brat, watch this. Within a minute….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Song An looked up with a cocky smile. From his perspective, Yang Zhen’s situation was the most simple of altitude sickness.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What swollen arm? What redness on the neck?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>All he awaited was for Yang Zhen to stand up from the ground and smack Ye Zichen’s face real hard…</span></p>
 <p><span style>A minute passed by in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Zhen, who was on the ground, did not recover at all. However, what worried people was that his face had gradually turned from stark white to purple, while his arm also became bright red as his blood vessels became more apparent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>”Why did my dad become like this!” Yang Yushi interrogated Song An.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Song An also became extremely worried.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This shouldn’t be. My treatment had no issue, but why didn’t the patient wake up and instead get this sort of symptom?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“This is the authority you were talking about? F*ck off!” Ye Zichen pushed Song An, who was rather frantic, away. He truly felt a bit of pity for the US’s medical prizes.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>A person like this actually managed to gain countless awards and got a master’s degree in the medical institution…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you have silver needles here?” Ye Zichen frowned towards the flight attendant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The flight attendant instantly nodded, “Yes, yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bring some over for me. I’m going to give him an acupuncture treatment. Also, if you have a small knife and a towel, then bring it over as well. The knife must be sterilized at high temperatures!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem!” the stewardess quickly left the cabin. She did not dare to put on any airs against the passengers within the cabin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The people in the cabin were all successful people, and the person who fell down was actually Yang Yushi’s father. There was no need to mention Yang Yushi’s identity since she was a beyond popular celebrity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she seemed to have seen the young man asking for silver needles somewhere as well…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, my dad will be fine, right?” Yang Yushi said worriedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen patted her head with a smiled comfortingly at her, “He’ll be fine. What’s there to be worried about with me here? But after he wakes up, you have to convince him to do a full body check in the hospital, his body…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shook his head with a sigh, causing Yang Yushi to become more nervous. At the same time, the stewardess also brought the items Ye Zichen had asked for.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chinese doctor?” Song An frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen disregarded him, and proceeded to cut Yang Zhen’s arm with the small knife.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you doing!?” Song An criticized loudly with a frown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen merely shrugged, “I’m letting out blood. If you can’t tell, then why are you still a doctor?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you know what consequences it’ll cause?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you trying to educate me, Expert Song?” Ye Zichen’s expression turned even darker as he laughed coldly. “I’m wiping your ass clean here. Otherwise, if someone dies, then you going to take criminal responsibility? Or are you just going to say that you tried your best, and stay silent about your uselessness?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wipe my ass?” Song An sneered. He twitched his mouth as if he was about to ramble on about how many accomplishments he had achieved in the medical realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen merely rolled his eyes at Song An and snorted, “I don’t want to care about you. The patient’s family member is right here. I’ll start if she agrees.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I agree!” Yang Yushi blurted out without thinking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sliced the small knife along Yang Zhen’s arm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blood squirted out as if it was stored in a high-pressured gauge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen disregarded the blood that splashed on him, and silently counted the time in his heart as he grabbed the white towel and pressed down on Yang Zhen’s wound.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, that did not seem to slow down the blood flow at all. Not long later, the towel was completely dyed red.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Silver needle!” the stewardess quickly brought the silver needles in front of Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He used one hand to hold Yang Zhen’s arm, while he used the other hand to pierce down on the acupuncture points with the silver needles without checking the location of the points first.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All the passengers in the cabin couldn’t help but worry for Ye Zichen. After all, the spurt of blood earlier was far too terrifying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bring me another towel!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In several moments, six towels were completely dyed red with Yang Zhen’s blood. At the same time, Ye Zichen squinted his eyes, and rotated the silver needles gently </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Phew,” Ye Zichen let out a long sigh, then rotated his neck and stood up from the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The gaze of all of the passengers in the cabin were set onto him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Yushi also asked nervously, “How is he?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’ll probably wake up soon,” Ye Zichen smiled softly, then looked towards the stewardess. “Please prepare some candy for him. He might feel a bit dizzy when he wakes up…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen turned around and walked towards his own seat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Song An frowned behind him, “You want to leave? Are you trying to avoid taking responsibility?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you think that I’m you?” Ye Zichen sneered. “Bringing public shame to yourself without any skills. It was fortunate that I was here… If it wasn’t for me, then he really would have died because of you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bullshit!” Song An clenched his teeth and cursed. “Do you know how many…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So what I you received all of the medical prizes? You… did not save the person. Even if you stick all of the awards on yourself, it cannot hide your useless self. Did you manage to see what sort of acupuncture technique I used just now? No, right!? Since that’s the case, then why are you still competing…” The technique Ye Zichen had used was the Nine Yang Life Continuation acupuncture technique. Ye Zichen had thought that it would shut Song An up after using it, but from the looks of it, Song An didn’t know anything…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I seriously don’t know why an idiot like him actually managed to gain such achievements in the medical realm.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, stop showing off how petty you are. I’m not a random person who walked by. We’re on the same plane right now. Even if something happens… Just come and find me in my cabin!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shook his head with a soft smile and left. Song An clenched his teeth as he looked at Ye Zichen’s back, while his face turned terrifyingly dark.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Please don’t wake up, please don’t wake up.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, fate was not on his side…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Zhen woke up mere moments after Ye Zichen left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The invisible smack on Song An’s face caused his face to hurt a bit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Yushi was also extremely happy, but put on an indifferent expression and asked, “You woke up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened to me?” Yang Zhen rubbed his head in confusion, then turned to Song An. “Did this doctor save me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I did not do a lot!” Song An answered shamelessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the passengers were truly speechless by his shamelessness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Yang Yushi retorted mercilessly “The person who saved you wasn’t him. If it wasn’t for Ye Zichen, then you might…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who?” Yang Zhen glared. “You said Ye Zichen?”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Original Chapter Teaser:</b>[expand]</p>

 <p><b>Song An:&nbsp;</b>Brat, watch this.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Alright, let's see. But honestly, I...</p>
 <p><strong>Song An:&nbsp;</strong>No one asked you for your opinion. I will show you what absolute authority is!</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>(mutters) And this is why I hate the so-called experts. They can just finger point all day and not ever take responsibility because they just say that it was a helpless cause...</p>

 <p><em>A minutes later...</em></p>
 <p><strong>Yang Yushi:&nbsp;</strong>Dad! Dad! Ye Zichen, please save him! Why did he turn so red!</p>
 <p><strong>Song An:&nbsp;</strong>Huh? What... Why? There was nothing wrong with what I did... Yes, it must be the patient's problem! Yes, it's all his fault!</p>
