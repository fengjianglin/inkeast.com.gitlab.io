 <p><span style><span>Chapter 160 – The Daisy will Always Bloom for you <a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stood inside a duplex apartment. He had called Su Yiyun a few hours ago and asked him to help him find an apartment near the school, he never would have thought that Su Yiyun would have finished doing that so quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re pretty quick!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You think? How could it be slow when I’m doing something for you?” Su Yiyun smiled proudly. “This apartment is about five minutes from our school. It’s a duplex, so the area is pretty big, and there’s a decent amount of daylight. The furnishings are also great… But what do you want this apartment for? Who are you going to move in with?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Su Yiyun’s expression turned more serious. He knew that his little sister was dating Ye Zichen!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can’t be wanting to hide a girl here, right?” Su Yiyun stood up from the sofa and stared straight at him. “If you really dare to do that, then don’t blame me for disregarding our brotherly bond…”</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>“Hide your sister <a id="footnoteref-2" href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>!” Ye Zichen swore.</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hide my sister?” Su Yiyun exclaimed. He quickly grabbed Ye Zichen by the collar. “You want to move in with my little sister this early? Fine, but be nice to her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Move in your ass.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you not want to live with my sister? Then who do you want to live with!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun reached out his hand once again. Ye Zichen shrugged his hands off, “F*ck, why don’t you understand. I’m not moving in with Su Yan, nor am I moving in with other women…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then who are you buying the apartment so urgently for!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are your eyes made of air? Did you not see those two chivalrous men over there?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen motioned towards Third Fatty Jin and the Great Sage in annoyance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Fatty Jin turned around and waved with a toothy smile as if he felt like it was his turn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hello, hello.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun did not think that Ye Zichen was going to move in with the fatty and the hulk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, Su Yiyun’s gaze changed, as he stepped back while hugging his arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi, I didn’t think that you were like that, Ye Zichen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fatty, hulk. You are having rather high-ended fun.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I… F*ck off. Laozi is a straight guy…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun rolled his eyes and also laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had been roommates with Ye Zichen for two years, if Ye Zichen truly was gay, then he would have felt it as a roommate ages ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was merely joking around just now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although he didn’t know why Ye Zichen was buying this apartment for those brothers, that wasn’t any of his business.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun reached out his right hand and raised his eyebrows at Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? Pay up!” Su Yiyun frowned. “This apartment’s three million and forty-three thousand. I’ll take off the units for you, so just give me three million and forty thousand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You need money?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why wouldn’t I? Laozi’s money didn’t come out of nowhere. It was nice enough of me to not ask for money when I helped you set up that supermarket.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Good.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>This was the Su Yiyun he knew.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Su Yiyun was someone that would ask for financial matters to be settled even if it was only one yuan, and this was such a huge amount.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll transfer it to you later.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, then I’ll be going. I hope you and your friends have fun.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun left the room with an ambiguous and playful smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shook his head and cursed him with a smile, then walk to the living room sofa.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Fatty Jin quickly stood up and said nervously, “Boss, I’m definitely heterosexual, but…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Fatty Jin bit his lips, as if he was struggling a lot in his heart, “If boss really needs it, then I can give up my most tender daisy for boss!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who was looking at WeChat moments on his sofa, spat all the water he just drank onto Third Fatty Jin’s legs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Fatty Jin gulped when he felt the wetness in between his legs, “Boss, could it be that you actually like wet seduction?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck, f*ck, f*ck… F*ck off.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen glared at Third Fatty Jin and shooed him away.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He truly had a worrying intelligence.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, my daisy is forever blooming for you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Fatty Jin shouted out that he would offer up his daisy once again as he left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s expression turned dark, while Great Sage looked up in confusion, “Daisy, is that delicious…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>How did he end up with these two treasures?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It seems like he would have a lot to do in the future!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen let out a soft sigh, then leaned back on the sofa to look at his WeChat moments.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That had already become a daily matter that he must do.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He could find out the situation within the Heavenly Court and Underworld through his contact’s moments.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though he didn’t have a lot of deities as contacts…</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was better than nothing!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen scrolled through it for a while, but didn’t find anything useful, so he decided to quit the app. At that moment, he saw a new friend request.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Xiangzi has sent a friend request.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That scum.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen ignored his friend request, then noticed the message from his idiol, Lü Dongbin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I spoke with Old Han already, he also understands his mistake. You two can chat now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen licked his lips after seeing that message, then accepted Han Xiangzi’s friend request.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked at the intimacy level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Friendly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>100.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wow, it seems like Old Lü is pretty amazing, he actually managed to tell explain it properly to that stubborn idiot.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry, celestial sovereign.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Xiangzi immediately sent an apologetic message the moment the friend request was accepted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was too impulsive then, and it was all me thinking too much. If there was anything that offended celestial sovereign, please don’t take offense.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>His attitude was rather sincere.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Never mind, I’m not blaming you. This sovereign did use too strong of a tone when I spoke with you previously.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That celestial sovereign replied!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Xiangzi chuckled as he held Lü Dongbin’s phone. Meanwhile, Lü Dongbin’s eyes never left his phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no helping it, Han Xiangzi was a habitual phone demolisher.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn’t help but be more vigilant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since he replied, then apologize properly. Then, after chatting well, hurry up and return my phone to me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>“Esteemed Master <a id="footnoteref-3" href="#footnote-3">[3]</a>, you’re too petty, so what even if you gave me the phone!” Han Xiangzi rolled his eyes.</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>Lü Dongbin frowned, “I can die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Han, don’t even think about tricking Old Lü of his phone. He can’t lose that phone. You’ve never seen his WeChat, there are countless little fairies from the Heavenly Court calling him Lü-gege, Dongbin-gege every single day… That’s the origin of the reason that he kept on talking about returning to the Eight Immortals Manor in the Heavenly Court!” Cao Guojiu smiled playfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lü Dongbin immediately blushed, “Don’t bullshit around!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Esteemed Master, Esteemed Master, still water truly runs deep!” Han Xiangzi shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lü Dongbin rolled his eyes, “Are you using the phone or not?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, yes, I am using it,” Han Xiangzi coughed awkwardly, then replied to Ye Zichen’s message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s great that celestial sovereign is not blaming me. I heard that celestial sovereign wants a Nine Heart Lotus Root?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ba-thump.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s heart beat rapidly when he saw this message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, I wonder if…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s phone rang right after sending the message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He closed the chat screen, then saw that he got a new friend request.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortal Lady He has sent you a friend request.</span></p>
