 <p><span style>Chapter 85 – The fifth Fragment of Soul Pearl Yiyuan</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Canopy Marshal was definitely a top existence in the Heavenly Court’s glutton circle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had a huge appetite.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For example, when he was eating ginseng fruits, Sha Wujing only took one bite, but he chucked the entire fruit in his mouth without tasting anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the future, he was definitely going to be a huge customer of Ye Zichen’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled as he looked at the Canopy Marshal’s urgent tone on the screen, “What business does the Canopy Marshal have with this sovereign?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, Old Pig does have just a little matter with the Sky Sovereign.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Canopy Marshal laughed dumbly, then added a few embarrassed emojis.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, Ye Zichen managed to get a good idea of what he wanted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Say it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign got more than a fragment of Soul Pearl Yiyuan from one of the Dragon Kings, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was stunned when he saw this reply. Why was it the Soul Pearl Yiyuan? He had thought that the Canopy Marshal should be mentioning drinks.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could it be that the Canopy Marshal is interested in this spiritual item?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>If he wanted it, then giving it to him was of no issue. Of course, that was on the basis of him exchanging some sort of treasure with Ye Zichen for it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment, Ye Zichen was like an evil merchant, only thinking about profits.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These deities have a ton of treasures, who was he supposed to screw over if not them!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Canopy Marshal wants the fragment of Soul Pearl Yiyuan? About this… Marshal should know that this fragment is an ancient divine item. This sovereign actually…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pretended like he wasn’t willing to give it away, in order to raise the price later on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If the Canopy Marshal actually wants it, then he would have to give up a lot of things.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But he was wrong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He, Sky Sovereign does want the fragment of Soul Pearl Yiyuan, right? Old Pig also has one, would it be possible to exchange it for several hundred bottles of the drink you sent the other day?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen felt the image in front of him darken when he saw the reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He really wasn’t a businessman material. That’s great now, he had picked up a boulder and smashed his own feet with it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These deities from the Heavenly Court really weren’t that easy to deal with. He must be more careful when he deals with these deities in the future.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck, you played me!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>If the Canopy Marshal heard this, he could definitely scream out his innocence. He was an honest boy in the Heavenly Court, okay!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at what was written once again…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Several hundred bottles of drinks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no way Ye Zichen could give him that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Canopy Marshal, this sovereign does require fragments of Soul Pearl Yiyuan, but even if you give me your fragment, this sovereign might not be able to collect all of the fragments for a complete one. So… the value is going to decrease by a huge chunk, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Raising the price as high as possible when selling, pushing the price down as low as possible when buying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a businessman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy General clearly agreed to Ye Zichen’s words, or perhaps he was just desperate for the soft drinks…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, how many bottles can you give me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thirty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A hundred.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fifty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eighty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s compromise, sixty-five. No more than that. Marshal, you have to know, these are rare goods.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s heart was bleeding even though it was only sixty five bottles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was nearly 200 yuan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This also means that he could have sold it for twenty thousand cultivation experience.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t think that it was worth using twenty thousand cultivation experience for a shitty fragment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, then we’ll do as Sky Sovereign says.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal directly sent the Soul Pearl Yiyuan fragment over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wasn’t afraid of Ye Zichen breaking his promise. Ignoring the fact that a screenshot could be made of their conversation, no matter what, Ye Zichen was a Sky Sovereign that lived with Taibai Jinxing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He won’t just take a fragment from him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen put away the fragment, causing the number of fragments of Soul Pearl Yiyuan to reach 5 in the Treasure Chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was just 1 fragment away from a complete Soul Pearl Yiyuan. It seemed like he was very close, but he was still very far off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t know where the last piece was either. If he can’t find it…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then they were just rubbish.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, shouldn’t you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal wanted to speak, but stopped. Ye Zichen couldn’t help but roll his eyes when he saw his desperate look, “One moment, this sovereign needs to return to the mansion to get it.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck, he needs to buy some first, okay?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen went to the supermarket downstairs to buy a few boxes of drinks. As he did so, he couldn’t help but have a thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of his junk food would definitely become a trend in the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As opposed to going to a supermarket to buy it every day, he might as well open a supermarket.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When that happens, he can just directly scan whatever the Heavenly Court wants.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This would prevent trouble and the leakage of his secret.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Ye Zichen sent the drinks over to the Canopy Marshal, the other side directly received it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was clear that this big bro of the glutton circles, Canopy Marshal, had been waiting in front of the screen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, why is there a bag of food as well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dorayaki, it’s a gift. If you think it’s delicious, then just advertise it for this sovereign in the Heavenly Court.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood, understood. Thank you, Sky Sovereign.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your intimacy level with Canopy Marshal increased by 20. Current intimacy level: 120.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen put away his phone, his face was full of smiles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seems like his business can open up in the Heavenly Court very soon. When that happens, cultivation experiences would come rolling in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But before then, he needed to find time to make a flyer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It would be like the order menu for restaurants, all of the items would be on there. Then, when a deity wants something, they can just send him the cultivation experience through WeChat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He’ll immediately send out the goods.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Darling, remember to leave a 5-star rating.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen returned to Huang Shengmei’s office with a dumb smile. Doctor Huang sat on the chair without moving, waiting for Ye Zichen’s return.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Doctor Huang,” Huang Shengmei quickly stood up from the chair and said in a weird tone. “Stop calling me Doctor Huang. Call me Shengmei.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did Ye Zichen realize, their affability level was nearly the borderline for lovers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shengmei.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Shengmei felt a sweetness in her heart. She didn’t know why she fell uncontrollably for Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as if a string was dragging her all the way to Ye Zichen’s side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh yeah, you have pretty much healed. I’ll directly help you get discharged. It’s pretty expensive living in the hospital, it’s too much of a waste of money. Also, just come directly to my home the next time you need the bandages changed. I’ll change it for you at home.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was rather unused to this sort of rocket development.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn’t help but note how amazing Yue Lao’s marriage string was. The moment he affability level reached there, they did not need to develop any feelings for each other for it to turn like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay, I’ll help your little brother and look at his legs when I get my bandages changed. If there’s nothing else, then I’ll be going.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay, take care.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Ye Zichen left Huang Shengmei’s office, he leaned on the wall and panted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing’s delicate face was full of disdain. She floated around him once and snorted, “Scum.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How am I a scum?” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes. “I’m telling you, you’re lucky that you’re a ghost girl. If you were a human, I wouldn’t even let you go, do you understand? I will completely control you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk, only a ghost would need you to be controlled by you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing snorted, while Ye Zichen chuckled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aren’t you a ghost?”</span></p>
