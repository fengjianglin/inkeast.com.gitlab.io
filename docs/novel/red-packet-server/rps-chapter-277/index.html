 <p><span style>Chapter 277 – The Dog that Swore to Become a Beast God</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sun Yige’s cool figure when leaving, and the notes that she pressed onto the table…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This feels as if I went to get a prostitute, but ended up as a male one myself…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>This definitely wasn’t something that the normal Sun Yige could do. If the soul hooking actually succeeded, then she should have blushed, lowered her head and played with the corners of her shirt.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But just now…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t tell me that you didn’t make a move when such a great opportunity presented itself!” Ye Zichen’s face was covered in speechlessness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I did make a move!” White Impermanence said plainly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then why didn’t she recover?” Ye Zichen was a bit stunned. “Didn’t Ox Bro say that she would recover when the extra soul is hooked away? I don’t see any soul in your hand!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She doesn’t have any extra soul,” White Impermanence shrugged. “How am I supposed to hook it if she has no extra soul? If I really did hook, then she should be reporting to the Underworld with me right now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you say?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was stunned. </span><i><span style>No extra soul? Then the image I saw when I used the Thousand Li Tracking Sigil…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could class rep really have split personalities?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>The extremes of everything is what’s opposite it. So she suppressed herself until she exploded, and caused her to get a multiple personality disorder?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen closed his eyes and thought about it carefully. He needed to search through his mind to see if there is any method in Old Lord Taishang’s Special Medical Journal that would cure a multiple personality disorder.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I need to cure this as soon as possible, otherwise, if this drags on, Class Rep Sun would be in heaps of trouble.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>At that same time, on the way from the cold drinks store to Polytechnic University’s female dorms…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sun Yige played with her hair and carried a faint smile on her face as she occasionally touched her lip with her fingers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A leather jacketed woman smiled in a chaotic consciousness, “How is it? I helped you say what you want to say, and helped you do what you want to do. How does it feel?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sun Yige, who was wearing a flowered dress, squatted on the floor near her silently with a blush across her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was obvious that she had not calmed down from the kiss earlier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re not speaking, it seems like you’re really shy!” The leather-jacket woman smiled playfully. “Your little man is rather nice to you, he even got a soul reaper from the Underworld just now in an attempt to hook my soul away. But no matter what, he definitely did not expect that I am you and you are me… We were originally one and the same!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not the same person with you!” Sun Yige, who was wearing a flowered dress, stood up angrily. “This is my body, when are you going to leave!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>“So what if you don’t admit it? To be honest, this little man is rather interesting. It’s just a shame that you two aren’t the same kinds of people,” The leather-jacket woman pursed her lips, walked in front of Sun Yige and patted her head. “The blood of the Nine Li<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> flows through you. In the end, you’re going to be on the side opposing him!”</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>Sun Yige pushed the woman’s hand away, “I don’t know what you’re talking about!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s alright, you’ll understand in the future,” The leather jacket woman smiled. “Some things are destined. In the future, you two will definitely be on opposing sides. No matter how much you love him right now, it is impossible for you two in the future… I would advise you to give up earlier, and let the pain be short!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I said it already, I don’t know what you’re talking about!” Sun Yige roared and pointed at the woman with a frown. “This is my body, please leave!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem, I’ll leave right now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>What Sun Yige did not expect was that the leather-jacketed woman actually did not refuse, and actually left her body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Sun Yige was able to control her body once again, she completely froze on the spot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, she touched her lips with her hands… </span><i><span style>That was my first kiss!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, a leather-jacketed woman who looked identical to Sun Yige stood behind her and shook her head with a chuckle, “Such foolishness, my Body Double!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Ye Zichen sent White Impermanence away, he returned to the mansion and continued to search for a way to cure a split personality disorder in his mind…</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, even after a long time, he was still unable to find anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That doesn’t make sense. Ahh, it probably is because it isn’t called multiple personality disorder in the ancient times,” Ye Zichen squinted his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Lil’ White ran over with his tongue out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss!” Lil’ White rubbed himself against Ye Zichen’s leg.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he looked at the little fellow, Ye Zichen thought of White Impermanence’s words…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He rubbed Lil’ White’s head, “You can ascend into a divine beast in the future?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A divine beast is too weak!” Contrary to his expectations, Lil’ White actually twitched his mouth in disdain. “I’m a male dog that’s going to become a beast god, how can a mere divine beast be the ends to my advancement!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hehehe….</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Where did this damn dog learn how to be so shameless?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen continued to rub Lil’ White’s head, “You said that you actually really ascend into a divine beast? What would you be like if you become a divine beast?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A divine beast is nothing. I already said it, I’m a male dog that will become a beast god!” Lil’ White looked up proudly.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bragging once was enough, why is he addicted to being shameless?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately raised his hand to slap Lil’ White.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, Lil’ White immediately jumped to the side and wagged his tail, “Boss, why are you always hitting me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Beating you is care, scolding you is love, I’m spoiling you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I rather be more distant to you. We seriously have no need to be extremely close!” Lil’ White said seriously on the tea table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehehe… you’re defying me now!?” No matter how agile Lil’ White was, he was not as agile as Ye Zichen, who reached out his hand to grab Lil’ White and smacked his head a few times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Try exaggerating again!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How did I exaggerate?” Lil’ White glared. “What I’m saying is the truth!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, then tell me just what sort of level are you at right now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Spiritual Beast!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How far is that from divine beast?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ten thousand miles!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what about the distant between divine beast and beast god?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ten thousand miles!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen knocked Lil’ White’s head and cursed, “That’s like twenty thousand miles in total, and you’re telling me that you’re not exaggerating?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I really am not this time!” Lil’ White struggled out of Ye Zichen’s hands and raised his proud proudly. “I have inherited memories in my head, this was something that my inherited memories told me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Inherited memories?” Ye Zichen paused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Inherited memories are only in descendants of yaos that are of divine beast level and above which possesses the talent of becoming divine beasts! That’s why, Boss, I’m telling you, I’m a male dog that will become a beast god!” Lil’ White wagged his tail proudly with his head held high.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as if he was saying…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hurry up and praise me. I’m so amazing!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ White, if you continuous to act pretentiously, I really will beat you!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So apparently the eliminated dog I got from the Howling Celestial Hound is a divine beast!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen did not think that he was that lucky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everything I said was true… Why don’t you believe me!” Lil’ White muttered sadly. “Can’t you normally feel where I’m amazing…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I just feel that you’re extremely shameless!” Ye Zichen replied seriously.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Original Chapter Teaser:</b>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</b>... Just... WHAT. THE. F*CK!? Why didn't she return to normal?</p>
 <p></p>
 <p><strong>White Impermanence:&nbsp;</strong>I dunno.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Did you not make a move to hook out the extra soul?</p>
 <p><strong>White Impermanence:&nbsp;</strong>I did.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Then?</p>
 <p><strong>White Impermanence:</strong>&nbsp;I couldn't do anything.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Huh? What do you mean?</p>
 <p><strong>White Impermanence:&nbsp;</strong>I couldn't hook anything out because she had no extra soul. If I did hook her out, then she would have died.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Do you mean to say...</p>
 <p><strong>White Impermanence:&nbsp;</strong>Do I mean to say..?</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>That she just went coo-coo? Like she got the whole multiple personality disorder thingy!?</p>
