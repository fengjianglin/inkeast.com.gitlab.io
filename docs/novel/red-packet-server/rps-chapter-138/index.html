 <p><span style>Chapter 138 – The Spokesperson Yue Lao</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Bai Dahai took his wife and daughter away, Ye Zichen pursed his lips and smiled when he thought back to the scene of them meeting, “Hai-ge, thank you so much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re still treating Hai-ge like an outsider,” Xiao Hai frowned slightly unhappily. He poured a cup of tea for Ye Zichen and said, “Taste it, this is Da Hong Pao that Hai-ge asked people to buy at a very high price.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You know that I don’t really understand tea,” as Ye Zichen gave an excuse, he took a sip from his tea cup. “Not bad.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You only know how to say that,” Xiao Hai shook his head with a smile. Then he quickly retracted his smile. “Are you sure you want to do this? The person behind Hao Wen is not normal. I feel like you already earned enough by removing the unstable factor of Bai Dahai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“People are greedy,” Ye Zichen rotated his neck meaningfully, then crossed his legs. “If I allow Hao Wen to continue on like this, he will be a worrying unstable factor for me. Since he has someone supporting him, then it isn’t completely awful for me to contact the person behind him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Hai sighed. He could feel Ye Zichen’s determination just from his expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Ye Zichen kept on calling him Hai-ge, Xiao Hai did not think that he understood Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was mysterious, and capable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nothing about him could be seen through.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Hai nodded with a smile as he finished his cup of tea, “Then Hai-ge won’t try to talk you out of it. Just decide it by yourself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, Hai-ge has no need to worry, I’m not a child,” Ye Zichen chuckled. When he suddenly thought of Zhuge Kongming, who was in the supermarket, he couldn’t help but ask. “Hai-ge, has&nbsp;there been any reaction to the news I asked you to spread in your circles?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Hai was confused for a moment. After quite a while, he finally understood and said, “You’re talking about that child called Zhuge Kongming?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes,” Ye Zichen nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This child had been by his side for too long. Although it wasn’t much for him to feed this child, Ye Zichen had too many secrets, so allowing the kid to carrying on staying there wasn’t going to work.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s more, the parents who lost their child would worry!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“No news,” Xiao Hai shrugged. “Both Dongfang Wenyi and I spread the news in our circles, but we didn’t hear which family in the capital had a child that ran away from home.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then could he be from other places?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen knew the reason for that kid to run away from home, so that child might have intentionally made up a false address in fear of Ye Zichen using it as a way to find his parents.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You should be clear about how your Hai-ge does things. I did think that maybe he wasn’t someone from the capital, but I didn’t hear any news of children running away from home from other provinces.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, it was Ye Zichen’s turn to get stressed. Just what did this kid, Zhuge Kongming do?</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the looks of him, he seemed like the child of a rich family, but there was no news about him in the circles.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could Zhuge Kongming’s family’s circle be different to Xiao Hai’s…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Or did his parents not realize? If that’s the case, then these parents are too neglecting.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Hai raised his eyebrows when he saw the troubled look on Ye Zichen’s face, “How about I help you ask in other circles!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I’ll be troubling Hai-ge.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rubbed his head while being uncertain of what to do after leaving the Xiao family.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei was a workaholic, he could barely see her free at the jewelry store, so he didn’t want to go and disturb her…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan and Xia Keke both have lessons in the afternoon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thinking about it, Ye Zichen seemed to be only able to go to the small supermarket.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There hasn’t been anyone that has come to cause trouble at the supermarket, right?” Ye Zichen sat in the chair at the cashier’s counter and smoked. To be fair, it was pretty nice having the little shopkeeper, Zhuge Kongming around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At least someone cleans up the supermarket pretty nicely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No one came to cause trouble, but there were a few that wanted to buy stuff. However, I just sent them away by telling them the supermarket haven’t opened yet.” Zhuge Kongming took out a can of coke form the fridge, then muttered after a sip. “Zichen-ge, I have always been really curious, what’s the point of opening this supermarket if you’re not selling?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately rolled his eyes when Zhuge Kongming said this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t ask what you shouldn’t.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh,” Zhuge Kongming twitched his mouth bitterly, then ran out of the supermarket to look at the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was also troubled as he looked at the entire supermarket, which was full of goods.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t know what was going on with the Heavenly Court, but no one came to ask him to stock up. This wasn’t quite like the mass sales he imagined.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at Yue Lao’s moments, the daily advertisements were very on point.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>But why wasn’t Yue Lao coming to him to stock up!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, there was no need for him to think about Monkey Bro, Bajie and Erlang Shen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>According to Ye Zichen’s recent observations, the three of them weren’t cut out for this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the more troubling aspect was Immortal Lady He….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stared at Immortal Lady He’s profile picture in the chat group for a long time. Only she had Nine Heart Lotus Roots.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, he didn’t know her, and this immortal lady just entered the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he just casually adds her, it might have the opposite effect. What’s more, the Eight Immortals might not want stuff like soft drinks from him…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s phone vibrated several times at that moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Someone spoke up in the spokesperson group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: Great deity!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: @Only Idealism, great deity!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since this geezer sought him out in the spokesperson group, could there be sales?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great deity, stock up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment within Yue Lao’s home in the Heavenly Court, Yue Lao, who’s hair was completely white, seemed like he hasn’t rested for a long time. However, his eyes revealed an excited light…</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was a light that would only be revealed when a businessman notices profits!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you want to be an agent!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, I want to be an agent.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, private chat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, Yue Lao and Ye Zichen started in their own chat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: Great deity, this time, I need…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao listed a long list of products and the required quantity. From the looks of it, it seemed like Yue Lao was about to open a supermarket in the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen calculated it approximately, it would require at least a hundred thousand cultivation experience.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was definitely a huge deal for him. Normally speaking, he would directly send everything out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he had a slight issue…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you know Immortal Lady He!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Immortal Lady He of the Eight Immortals?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, that’s her. Do you know her?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course I do, I was the one who screwed up her relationship with Han Xiangzi back then.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So it was this geezer’s fault.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen knew about Han Xiangzi and Immortal Lady He since he was young, he felt rather sorry for them since they didn’t end up together. He never would have expected Yue Lao to have been the one to screw it up.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>More importantly, screwing up someone else’s relationship…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>They shouldn’t be in that good of a relationship, right?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Then are you on good terms with Immortal Lady He?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m on amazing terms with her,” Yue Lao suddenly replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was a bit confused when he saw this message!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wait!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Screwing up their relationship, yet being on good terms.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re not lying to me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How would I dare to lie to great deity, my relationship with Immortal Lady He is truly amazing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright,” Ye Zichen smiled. “Then introduce me to Immortal Lady He. If you succeed, then I’ll give you twenty percent off whenever you need to stock up from me in the future!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“About this…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen thought Yue Lao would instantly agree, yet, Yue Lao actually hesitated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a long while, Yue Lao sent out a slightly testing message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great deity, do you want to pursue Immortal Lady He?!”</span></p>
