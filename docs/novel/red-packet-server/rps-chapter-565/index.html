 <p><span style>Chapter 565 – Back Up</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems like they are planning to discard you!” Iron Bull grabbed Xue Lian by her neck and mocked her with disdain. “Look, so what if you were nice to them? You’re nothing compared to Mount Supreme’s key.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ugh…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xue Lian grabbed Iron Bull’s arm tightly, and repeatedly kicked him. Everyone had a will to live, and she was no exception, especially because she had two children.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She looked towards the manor. She understood very well that the keys must be extremely important.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>But I want to live…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“So you are really going to discard her. What a pity. She’s just going to die like this for you,” Iron Bull laughed maniacally, then tightened his grip…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop!” Ye Zichen walked out with Yang Jian and co., as he held a small pouch in his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xue Lian’s eyes immediately lit up when she saw that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Iron Bull also snorted, “Haha, I really didn’t expect you to come out. But don’t think about grabbing her from me. You guys do have more people but I only need to move my finger in order to kill her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Put her down. You want the keys, right? We brought them over,” Ye Zichen squinted his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Iron Bull laughed, “Don’t treat Old Bull as an idiot. Do you think I’ll believe you just like that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yang Jian,” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, Yang Jian walked over with nine shiny keys in his hands, which he placed into the pouch, “The keys are here. We’ll do the exchange simultaneously.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Toss the keys over, and we’ll let her go,” with that, Iron Bull put Xue Lian down, but still maintained a firm grip on her shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Here you go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian threw the pouch into midair…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Another huge commotion sounded out. Iron Bull immediately turned back, then saw a spiritual formation appear above the Snow Rabbit Clan’s village.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Several tens of figures were kicked out. At the same time, a black-robed man appeared above the Snow Rabbit Clan’s village, and made an “ok” sign towards Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s that black robed man again.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen frowned, but he did feel like the person was helping them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian punched Iron Bull, causing the latter to skid backwards, then reached towards the pouch in the air. Ye Zichen also used this chance to grab Xue Lian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You alright?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you sire!” Xue Lian thanked Ye Zichen as she covered her neck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Bian Tianrui also roared, “Don’t care about it so much. Grab the keys!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You actually dared to use tricks!?” Iron Bull glared with a cold snort. His right arm also suddenly turned thick, as he turned to fight with Yang Jian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, catch!” Yang Jian chucked the pouch of keys towards Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Jail King and co. also charged towards Iron Bull. “Grandson, I didn’t beat you until I’m happy yet. You actually dared to come!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh,” Iron Bull merely twitched his mouth with disdain. “Do you think you guys are the only one with numbers? We came prepared this time as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fire Snake Dance!” A loud roar sounded out from the sky, then, a few snakes made of flames hissed as they slid across the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s Fire Cloud Gate,” Ruan Qingtian smirked. “I didn’t expect them to go to that side.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s way too normal,” Ye Zichen smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A red-robed man suddenly appeared in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, old dog,” Ruan Qingtian. “So Fire Cloud Gate actually sent you over. What? Does Fire Cloud Gate have no more people?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ruan Qingtian, don’t get so cocky,” the red-robed man smiled sinisterly, then looked towards Ye Zichen. “It’s you right? You’re that brat on the Fire Cloud Gate’s blacklist – Ye Zichen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh? My name’s on a list? I’m so honored,” Ye Zichen laughed meaningfully. Then, when he saw where the person was looking, he shook the pouch. “You want them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not foolish enough to use spiritual energy recklessly before Mount Supreme appears. I can deal with you after we after,” the red-robed man said with disdain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t even have a key, and you want to enter?” Ye Zichen twitched his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha,” the red-robed man merely maintained his look of disdain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Bian Tianrui also walked over, “Brother Tian, why bullshit so much with them? Just snatch it from them directly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I said it already, I won’t waste any spiritual energy before entering Mount Supreme,” the red-robed man shook his head. “What’s more, don’t you still have backup?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t want to use it this early!” Bian Tianrui revealed a troubled expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’ll be difficult if you want to snatch the keys over,” the red robed man smiled. “We, the Fire Cloud Gate, already have a key, and the fire snake was already my duty. It’ll be up to you to see whether you can get a key.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, the red-robed man turned around and departed. Bian Tianrui’s expression instantly darkened as he squinted his eyes with a chuckle, “So everyone in the Lower Three Realms are so cocky.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s not that we’re cocky. It’s just that you’re too weak,” Ruan Qingtian twitched his mouth. “See? Even old dog dares to bully you. Say, just what can you do? Hurry up and go back to the Upper Three Realms, this place is unsuitable for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Iron Bull also fell onto the ground with Jail King’s punch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, he still lost while being outnumbered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bian Tianrui, what more do you have to say? Even your allies don’t want to help you. You want to deal with us just by yourself…” Ye Zichen shook his head. “What are you going to pay for your life this time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I feel like you should give me the keys,” Bian Tianrui shook his head and smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows, “Are you being delusional?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just look behind yourself to see whether I’m being delusional,” Bian Tianrui smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen turned around…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen grabbed Bian Tianrui by his collar, and roared darkly, “Bian Tianrui, do you have no limits!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Lady!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zuo Mo!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kongming!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The expressions of Ruan Qingtian, who was on the ground; the dragon elder, who was in the sky; Jail King; as well as Zhuge Hong all changed drastically.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Iron Bull took this chance to leap up into the air, and punch all three of the ones fighting him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shouldn’t you let me go now? That brat is very obedient right now. Do you want something to happen to them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Heh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pushed him onto the ground, then saw Bian Tianrui hold his sword in his hands, while Zuo Mo and co. walked in front of him. What’s more, he still kept another sword on their necks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bi Shengtian!” Ye Zichen clenched his fist tightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bi Shengtian subconsciously avoided his gaze, and went over to Bian Tianrui, “I’ve done as you asked. Give me the cure!”</span></p>
