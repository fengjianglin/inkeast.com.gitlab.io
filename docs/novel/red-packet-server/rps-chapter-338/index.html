 <p><span style>Chapter 338 – That Bastard Wind Catching Ear</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s hands shuddered.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>A red packet’s a red packet, but just what the hell is an ear? I’ve been in the Heavenly Court’s group for quite some time, but the stuff I’ve gotten were always pills and sigils that I can use. Just what the hell is someone else’s ear supposed to do?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could it be that he was willing to give up his ear just because his son got first place?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>That’s truly an amazing fatherly love!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen didn’t dare to open the Treasure Chest to take a look. He was truly worried that he would have nightmares if he saw a bloody ear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen subconsciously looked down at the messages in the chat…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: I give full marks for this spreading of wealth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha: What the heck is this supposed to be!</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Seriously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mother of Lightning: I know right!?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Barefoot Immortal: This was supposed to be spreading wealth? Can you stop making fun of us? My heart is weak, so don’t scare me!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was rather stunned when he saw the messages in the chat. Those guys, including the heavenly soldiers, all seemed to be retorting about Wind Catching Ear’s red packet…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is there something strange about the red packet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen scratched his head and clicked on the red packet to see what everyone else got…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy received Wind Catching Ear x1.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha received Wind Catching Ear x1.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Heavenly Soldier A received Wind Catching Ear x1.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every single red packet of the one hundred that was sent out contained Wind Catching Ear x1.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was also utterly speechless.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s going on? Was the ear separated into a hundred pieces? Doesn’t that mean that everyone got a fragment of the Wind Catching Ear?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Wind Catching Ear: It’s just a small token of my goodwill. If my kid is first place again during the midterms, I’ll send everyone a huge one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: Great deities are even more outrageous than little fairies like us when they get shameless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha: You actually…</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Hehe…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mother of Lightning: Hehe!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Barefoot Immortal: Do you believe that I seriously want to punch you?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Damn…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>He already split his ear, and that doesn’t even count as a huge red packet? </span></i><span style>Ye Zichen frowned. </span><i><span style>Wait, could it not be an ear? But what’s going on with these deities? Why are they so worked up!?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Fine, let’s find out!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen grit his teeth and clicked on the Treasure Chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he saw the true face of the Wind Catching Ear in the Treasure Chest, Ye Zichen felt like he was truly too naïve. </span><i><span style>I knew it, how could a deity send a ear…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>What laid inside the Treasure Chest was a copy of the “Wind Catching Ear” secret scripture by hand, and it was very likely that the deities in the group also received the same.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>But if that’s the case, the deities in the group shouldn’t have such a huge reaction.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>No matter what, Wind Catching Ear is a pretty good secret scripture. Being able to listen to the conversation of people from miles away is very useful.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Withdrawing this secret scripture requires a payment of 200000 cultivation experience. Would you like to proceed?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Does your kid know that you’re this f*cking shameless?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen could not tolerate it anymore. </span><i><span style>Did this guy come to spread wealth or gather wealth? He actually sent a secret scripture that requires cultivation experience to withdraw.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I don’t blame Barefoot Immortal for what he said, even I want to punch Wind Catching Ear now.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What does he think this is? Does he think it’s an invitation for a graduation feast, and that everyone needs to bring along a present?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Ye Zichen spoke up, everyone in the group exploded. After a small commotion, the entire group decided to condemn Wind Catching Ear for his shamelessness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wind Catching Ear: Why is everyone having such a huge reaction? It only costs two hundred thousand cultivation experience to withdraw, is that a lot for you guys?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: What do you think? How could little deities like us have so much cultivation experience. Even Sky Sovereign Nameless said you were shameless… Tsk, seriously, so despicable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Barefoot Immortal: @Wind Catching Ear. Don’t blame us! The main issue is that your secret scripture isn’t of much use to us deities.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wind Catching Ear: But those were all complete handwritten copies…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who was about to join in on the condemnation, suddenly stopped himself. </span><i><span style>Complete handwritten copies…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>If that’s the case, then it really does seem like it is a huge gift.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Perhaps it isn’t much use to the deities in the Heavenly Court, but it had plenty of uses for Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Withdraw…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Withdrawing this secret scripture requires a payment of 200000 cultivation experience. Would you like to proceed?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Proceed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You have studied the Wind Catching Ear handwritten secret scripture.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, Ye Zichen felt like his ears became a lot more sensitive, but at the same time…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*CK…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen covered his ears with force. At that moment, his ears were filled with all sorts of screams. Everything resounded out in his ears, from the car horns from the outside to the rowdy children!</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Wind Catching Ear, who was being condemned by the group members, suddenly posted a screenshot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Look, even Sky Sovereign supported me. This means that my treasure was definitely worth it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment he sent the message, everyone in the group couldn’t help but twitch their mouths and mock him, saying that the screenshot was fake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wind Catching Ear!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen resisted the pain from his ears, and directly sent Wind Catching Ear a friend request.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wind Catching Ear, who was arguing with the deities in the group, blanked out for a moment after seeing this friend request. </span><i><span style>What is a high level person like Sky Sovereign sending me a friend request for? Could it be that he wants the cultivation experience back?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>If that’s the case…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s so hard to earn cultivation experience in this world now. Even if it’s this Sky Sovereign that’s asking for it, I still don’t want to return it.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>If I don’t accept it, then I don’t need to stay in the Heavenly Court any longer. Although I’m a great deity, I’m basically just a guard at the South Heaven’s Gate. No matter how amazing I am, I won’t be more amazing than Sky Sovereign Nameless, who lives in the same area as Taibai Jinxing.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Accept.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He clenched his teeth and accept the friend request. However, he didn’t send any message when he accepted…</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Sky Sovereign doesn’t say anything, then neither will he!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brat, stop blabbering in the group. Hurry up and tell me how can I stop the Wind Catching Ear from hearing all the noises from the outside!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was truly in suffering due to his ears. The only reason he could send Wind Catching Ear a message was due to his strong will.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign doesn’t know how to use it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wind Catching Ear was a bit shocked. His technique was actually of a rather low level out of the various cultivation scriptures. </span><i><span style>Sky Sovereign should have read stuff like the techniques of a Saint, why does he need to ask me about this sort of basic technique?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t. Hurry up and say it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The noises in Ye Zichen’s ear gradually became louder and louder, and he felt that his eardrums were starting to slowly bleed…</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Ye Zichen was on the verge of breaking down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just block off the place in your ears using celestial spiritual energy. Just use celestial spiritual energy to open up the way when you want to use it again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, the method of usage was similar to the usage of the Fiery Eyes of Truth, but…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Celestial spiritual energy!” Ye Zichen clenched his teeth and let go of his phone in abandonment. In his current state, he was unable to use any celestial spiritual energy at all.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Doesn’t that mean my Wind Catching Ear wouldn’t be able to be closed? I can only…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Buzz…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A huge noise suddenly rang out in Ye Zichen’s ear. It was as if a traffic accident had occurred at a nearby location, causing a huge burden on Ye Zichen’s listening.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Creak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the door to his room was pushed open.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The one who walked in was Fatty Yin, who had two souls in his body. However, he did not have a smiling face, and instead walked over to Ye Zichen with a faint smirk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brat, you’re in trouble, aren’t you?”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Original Chapter Teaser:</b>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Are you f*cking kidding me? A-An ear!? I know his name is Wind Catching Ear, but still, this is way too much. How much must he love his kid for him to chop of his own ear and give it out to everyone just because his kid got first place in the test? Just... Seriously, what the heck is wrong with him!?</p>
 <p>Look at this even the other guys in the group are criticizing him... Wait, huh? He's a shameless bastard? A shameless jerk? That... Was not what I expected him to say. Did he perhaps not send body parts to other people? Then why the heck did he send his own ear!? Man, such misfortune! This level of misfortune is definitely on par with a certain spiked hair high school boy with a definite-not-magical right hand which can shatter even miracles!</p>
 <p>Huh? They're still so worked up? What could've happened? Could it be that this ear is actually something else? Like... Maybe the nickname for a herb or something? If that's the case then, that's way too weird!</p>
 <p>But... Fine, I'll bite. Hit me with what you've got, ear!</p>
