 <p><span style>Chapter 736 – Xiao Yumei Returns</span><span style>Ye Zichen turned to stone. He lost sight of everything in front of him except the person smiling at him.</span><span style>Emotions overwhelmed him when he saw her.</span><span style>His eyes watered, his hands trembled…</span><span style>At this moment, the Flame Emperor and co. also walked out from the secret tunnel…</span><span style>“Mes…”</span><span style>“Shhh,” Liu Qing put her finger to her lips to indicate them to remain silent.</span><span style>At the same time, she turned back to look at the pair gazing at each other.</span><span style>It was as if there was nothing else in their eyes except each other and heated tears.</span><span style>Tears dribbled down the ground and splattered on the red carpet in the Cloudy Palace of the Golden Arches.</span><span style>“Is it you?” After a long time, Ye Zichen finally managed to form a cohesive sentence.</span><span style>It may have seemed like something simple.</span><span style>But both of them knew how much it meant to him.</span><span style>Ye Zichen stared closely at the person in front of him. He wanted to see her nod…</span><span style>And just as he hoped.</span><span style>That person nodded.</span><span style>“How have you been?”</span><span style>“Good, and you?”</span><span style>“Good as well. You might not believe it right now, but I am still in charge of everything here. You see the people behind me? They are the leaders the Immortal Region, Heavenly Court and Underworld; and they all have to answer to me now.”</span><span style>“Who…” Jade Emperor tried to argue, but immediately stopped when he saw Liu Qing’s glare.</span><span style>“I believe you. Just like before, I will never doubt you.”</span><span style>“Mmm,” Ye Zichen nodded with a smile. “Did they bully you over there?”</span><span style>“No.”</span><span style>“That’s good. Tiantian has been great.”</span><span style>“Mm, I’m sure you would take good care of her.”</span><span style>“I’ve missed you.”</span><span style>“Me too.”</span><span style>Ye Zichen, who has always been good with words, suddenly stuttered. He wasn’t sure how he should speak with the woman in front of him.</span><span style>The best choice was actually to run up and give her a hug, but for some reason he felt his body stiffen in place.</span><span style>However, he soon smiled.</span><span style>She did as well.</span><span style>Both of them had many things to say to each other.</span><span style>But the timely smile surpassed any words.</span><span style>“Hmm, this is not going to what I imaged. I thought you would immediately run up, hug her and tell her how much you missed her,” Liu Qing spoke up in a very untimely manner.</span><span style>She was like a third wheel that stood between the two.</span><span style>She tiptoed and stood up straight as if trying to block off the pair from looking at each other.</span><span style>“Now you’re getting annoying,” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes speechlessly in response to Liu Qing destroying the atmosphere.</span><span style>Liu Qing merely shrugged with a pout, “So what? Your depressed tone through the phone. Zezeze…”</span><span style>“Shush!” Ye Zichen raised his hand.</span><span style>“What? You’re going to hit me? I’m telling you, I brought Big Sister Xiao here. If you dare to hit me, then I really will take her to the God Realm so you won’t be able to see her.”</span><span style>“Ugh, alright, fine, you win.”</span><span style>Ye Zichen gave in.</span><span style>Liu Qing nodded happily, then skipped over to the person in front of Ye Zichen.</span><span style>It was none other than Xiao Yumei.</span><span style>The person who had lingered on Ye Zichen’s mind; the one who caused Ye Zichen to wish for the destruction of the demons at all cost just to save her.</span><span style>Now…</span><span style>At that very moment!</span><span style>She was in front of him once more.</span><span style>Ye Zichen could still feel her gentleness from her smile just like before.</span><span style>“Hey, can you guys stop looking each other with that passionate gaze? I’ll be jealous, you know!” Liu Qing pouted.</span><span style>Xiao Yumei looked at her in confusion, then glanced at Ye Zichen.</span><span style>She knew about the girls by Ye Zichen’s side, but she didn’t recall seeing Liu Qing.</span><span style>“Big Sister Xiao, you don’t know me, but I know you. I already knew you in the Modern Realm. I was there even when you guys were… Hehehe…”</span><span style>“Liuuu Qinnnnng!” Ye Zichen shouted.</span><span style>Liu Qing stuck her tongue out with a giggle, “Looks like I said the wrong thing. Oh well, but basically, we have known each other for a long long time.”</span><span style>Then, her expression turned solemn, “I know you two have a lot to say to each other, but I feel like it’s more urgent to talk about my matters first, right?”</span><span style>This sudden change in mood shocked everyone. Liu Qing had practically turned from a normal little girl to the true messenger of the God Realm.</span><span style>However, they did not understand just what made the messenger so.</span><span style>“When is the Demon Realm’s messenger arriving?”</span><span style>Although the others didn’t know what was going on, Ye Zichen understood perfectly what Liu Qing referring to. Xiao Yumei’s return might have surprised him, but he understood that he had plenty of time with Xiao Yumei in the future, what was most important was to deal with the Demon Realm’s messenger.</span><span style>The other people were shocked. Demon Realm’s messenger…</span><span style>Didn’t we just defeat the demons? Why is the Demon Realm’s messenger coming?</span><span style>“He should be arriving in three days if nothing happens. Of course, I won’t let him arrive. Your identity will be exposed if he arrives here, so my plan is to kill him where he descends in two days.”</span><span style>“Mmm, what do I need to do?” asked Ye Zichen.</span><span style>“Big Brother Twelve knows a formation that requires four Supreme level experts as the eye of the formations. The formation is able to quickly increase the strength of one of the people in the eyes of the formation. Since I don’t have many people I can trust in the God Realm, I can only rely on Brother Twelve and I. That’s why I need you to provide the other two people for me.”</span><span style>Supreme.</span><span style>That was a level of existence which might be common in the God Realm, but they were in the Lower Three Realms.</span><span style>Supreme level means surpassing the Immortal King level.</span><span style>But around here…</span><span style>“Oh yeah, since I am of the Sky Supreme level and Brother Twelve is a ninth rank Earth Supreme. That means that the other two only has to be half a step into the Supreme levels,” Liu Qing added.</span> <span style>Half-a-step!</span><span style>Ye Zichen instinctively glanced at the Jade Emperor.</span><span style>The Jade Emperor was speechless. All he wanted was to ascend peacefully, he didn’t want to fight the Demon Realm’s messenger.</span><span style>He looked down to avoid Ye Zichen’s gaze, but the latter already walked beside him.</span><span style>“Jade Emperor, how about being the eye of the formation?”</span><span style>“Me?” The Jade Emperor raised his eyebrows. Ugh, I knew it.</span><span style>“Of course it wouldn’t be without any return. I promise you that the ley line will recover when you return and will help you breakthrough immediately.”</span><span style>The Jade Emperor really did want to refuse.</span><span style>But then he noticed the God Realm’s messenger’s gaze.</span><span style>“Alright, I’ll go. But let me ask a question first. Since the formation increases the strength of one eye of the formation, then who will be fighting the Demon Realm’s messenger?’</span><span style>He had to make sure of that first. </span><span style>After all, he didn’t want to die fighting the Demon Realm’s messenger.</span><span style>“Don’t worry about that. The main person fighting will be me!” Liu Qing answered without any hesitation.</span></p>
