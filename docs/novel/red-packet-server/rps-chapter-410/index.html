 <p><span style>Chapter 410 – Come Forth, White Tiger!</span></p>
 <p><span style>When everyone entered the Otherworld, the scene in front of their eyes completely shocked them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the organization members gasped, while both Ye Zichen’s and Wei Chen’s expressions turned solemn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What they saw were endless slimy reptilian monsters, while the skies were filled with screeching birds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The demonic energy in the air was so dense that it was actually about to liquify, and the stench of it was all the more revolting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The numbers this time are truly terrifying,” Wei Chen couldn’t help but light a cigarette for himself. Then, a silver short sword appeared in his hand. “Seriously, can’t they let people relax for a change?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gawk…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The birds circling in the air suddenly stopped, and stared at Ye Zichen and co. with their violet eyes before they let out a screech.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the slimy reptilian monsters instantly charged over. During so, they continuously spat out green slimy liquid from their mouths.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kiddos, it seems like they aren’t going to let us prepare. So let’s move!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zing…</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the Tribulation members all took out a silver short sword similar to the one Wei Chen held, while silver meridians began to surface on their black leather jackets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone shot towards the slime monsters, while Wei Chen chucked his cigarette to the ground and looked up at the strange birds in the sky…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Ye, take good care of yourself. I don’t have a way to help you in this situation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A huge crater appeared on the ground as Wei Chen shot up into the sky like a cannonball. Meanwhile, all the birds that were at places where his short sword passed through turned to smoke and disappeared into the demonic energy filled sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yiyuan!” Ye Zichen did not hesitate either, and called out Soul Pearl Yiyuan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Several hundred water blades appeared around him, and accurately hit the chests of the various birds in the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wei Chen raised his eyebrows in the air, and raised his thumb towards Ye Zichen. Just as he was about to hurry over to another place, a ten-meter-tall figure suddenly appeared behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Roar…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A huge fist swung over. Wei Chen stiffly turned sideways, causing the fist to scrape by his face. Even so, a mark of blood still appeared on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck, laozi already has a scar on the left side of my face, you want to give me a new one on my right?” Wei Chen muttered, then stepped forcefully on the huge abyssal’s head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, a huge palm slapped towards Wei Chen’s back. Since he could not even dodge in time, he was slapped to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wei Chen looked back, and saw that three huge abyssals already appeared around him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The three of them chose to surround him as they slowly moved towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, hey, hey, bullying with numbers doesn’t make you a hero,” Wei Chen let out a soft sigh, but did not appear frantic at all. He rubbed his slightly hurting shoulders, then took out another cigarette from his pocket and held it in his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Wei!” Ye Zichen noticed Wei Chen’s situation as well. Just as he was about to go over and help…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The strange birds in the sky completely blocked him off, and even the slimy monsters begun to quickly crawl towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So annoying.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen knitted his eyebrows tightly. Soul Pearl Yiyuan, which was in front of Ye Zichen, suddenly turned a crystal-like blue…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ice edge!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Splash.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the water blades around him instantly turned into ice blades. Then, those ice blades gathered together and flew to Ye Zichen’s hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Scatter!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ice edge in Ye Zichen’s hand instantly released a barrage of small ice shards that pierced all of the surrounding monsters, while Ye Zichen begun to move towards Wei Chen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Screech…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The strange birds in the sky suddenly loud out another ear piercing screech, causing the surrounding slimy reptilian monsters to immediately quickly crawl towards him as if they just received an unanimous order.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dragon Roar…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Roar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A deafening dragon roar sounded out, then a mirage of a huge dragon instantly swept across the ground and swallowed the monsters on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, Xia Keke ran over as she held Su Yan’s hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen saw them…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did you guys come? Hurry up and get out,” Ye Zichen’s eyes twitched intensely. The abyssal situation was different from before. With these sort of numbers, he even had trouble protecting himself. With the addition of the two of them…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I came to help you,” Xia Keke’s gaze was stern. Meanwhile, even though Su Yan was scared, she also nodded in agreement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What can you help me with? Stop messing around. Hurry up and get out!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Behind you!” Su Yan suddenly pointed with a shout.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen instinctively turned around and lopped off the reptilian monster’s head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s really dangerous here. Hurry up and leave!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Ye Zichen continuously killed the surrounding monsters with the ice edge in his hand, Xia Keke’s body also occasionally shimmered with a giant dragon’s mirage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then how are you going to send us out? Do you know how to do that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen instantly blanked out for a split second. This was only his second time entering the Otherworld, and only Old Wei knew about how to get out.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Old Wei!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He was surrounded by the three giant abyssals earlier, and Ye Zichen had no idea how he was doing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ignore us. Leave these small fries to me. Hurry up and go over there to see how you can help. Those three big guys over there should be very hard to deal with, right?” Xia Keke once again dealt with all the incoming monsters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at her with a nod, “Protect yourselves!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Ye Zichen was worried that something bad would happen to them, he intentionally called over a five people team to stay by them, while he hurried over towards Wei Chen’s direction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahem…” Wei Chen pushed himself painfully off the ground as he smoked. He tilted his head at the three monsters staring down at him. “Turning from a human into an abyssal was very painful, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Roar…</span></p>
 <p><span style>All he got in response was another emotionless roar and a huge foot that was more than a meter long.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wei Chen agilely dodged the attack, then rotated his shoulders, while a faint silver light flashed across his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems like you can’t recall anything. Ah… These guys that corrupted people really should face divine punishment. But no worries, I will set you free very soon. Treat all of this as a nightmare. I hope you guys can be slightly luckier in your next life.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Wei Chen’s hair begun to turn a light silver. Several white whiskers also appeared on his face, his hands became sharp claws, and his eyes turned into that of a feline…</span></p>
 <p><span style>A majestic aura was released from his body. At the same time, he also pursed his lips and smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come forth, White Tiger…”</span></p>

 <p><i>In the next chapter of Red Packet Server...</i></p>
 <p>Ye Zichen, Wei Chen and the tribulation members are surrounded by endless swarms of abyssals.</p>
