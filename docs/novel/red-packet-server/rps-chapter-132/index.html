 <p><span style>Chapter 132 – Method of Revival</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen snuck back in to the mansion, since it was already really late, the lights in the living room were all turned off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, a ghastly green light shone out from the darkness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re trying to scare laozi, aren’t you? Turn off your lighting effects.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The green light in the darkness was stunned for a moment, then disappeared, while Ye Zichen turned on the living room lights.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why aren’t you sleeping properly in the middle of the night, and instead wandering around? If it wasn’t because I’m rather strong mentally, I would have been scared to death by you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ White smiled, revealing it’s little dog teeth, then wagged its tail and started to rub itself against Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t it just because I’m worried that a thief broke into our home!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, you’re pretty vigilant. But how did you do those special effects just now, show me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This isn’t special effects, it’s scanning eyes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ White wagged its tail proudly, while a green light emitted from its eyes once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh wow!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This is really pretty interesting.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, Lil’ White turned off its scanning eyes. Ye Zichen sat onto the sofa with his legs crossed, while Lil’ White ran over happily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, how is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It looks pretty cool, but how useful is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Our scanning eyes have tons of functions…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do tell,” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows in interest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil White frowned for a while…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not too sure either!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his hand and slapped Lil’ White’s head.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I knew it, this dog was just a money-losing thing.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, why did you hit me again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ White revealed a troubled expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sighed helplessly and said, “The heck kinda use is it for you to develop these useless skills. It feels rather amazing, but aren’t actually useful.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t it because I’m still young!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whatever, go stay in the side.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sent Lil’ White away in annoyance. Then took out his phone and leaned on the sofa as he found King Chujiang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“King Chujiang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When King Chujiang, who was listening to music in the second hall of the Underworld, saw this, he was shocked.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why did this master find me?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could he have more requests for the Underworld? Or did this master come to cause trouble…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, that Yama thought about a lot of things.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“King Chujiang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Another message appeared on the screen, causing King Chujiang to gulp and send the music player in the hall away. He held his phone for a long time, then finally replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I thought you were asleep.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang blanked out for quite a while when he saw this message. How could they, the Ten Yama Kings, find time to sleep. Wandering ghosts would come every day, and they have to judge causes as well as give orders, so they were always short on time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But how would he dare to retort against that master’s words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not sleeping. I wonder what orders do you have for me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, Ye Zichen was shocked. No matter what, this was one of the Ten Yama Kings of the Underworld, why was he so respectful?</span></p>
 <p><span style>But since he was like that, then so be it, the heck does it have to do with Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There aren’t any orders, I just wanted to tell you that you should tell me the method of revival, and send me those merits.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Ye Zichen didn’t know what the merits would be useful for later on, they were definitely going to be useful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, I’ll immediately send you the merits.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang sent a red packet over, which Ye Zichen clicked on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received King Chugiang’s red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Heaven and Earth merits x10000.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your official position in the Underworld has been promoted. Current position: Level 4 Ghost Servant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His position in the Underworld was promoted again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen ignored this. He immediately replied after receiving the red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Method of revival.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The method of revival for a person, who died before their time, isn’t hard, nor is it simple.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tell me about the main points.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang wiped away the cold sweat on his forehead within the Underworld. </span><i><span style>This master was truly impatient.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“If you want to revive someone who died before their time, you need a Nine Heart Lotus Root, a thousand year Dragon Eye as well as the Holy Water of Yiyuan. At the same time, those ingredients need to be used with the Celestial Leveled Pill, the Three Striped Soul-Clearing Heaven-Returning Pill within the Reincarnation Pool inside the sixth hall of the Underworld.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Ye Zichen immediately noted down everything and searched the Treasure Shop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No Nine Heart Lotus Root.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No Thousand Year Dragon Eye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No Holy Water of Yiyuan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most importantly, he needed to go to the Underworld for revival.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This is essentially the same as not telling him. Could a mere mortal like him go to the Underworld?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“King Chujiang, are you messing with this sovereign!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cold sweat instantly flowed down King Chujiang’s face within the Underworld.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, everything I said was the truth.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, then tell me, how is a mortal like this sovereign supposed to go to the Underworld?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s no problem, if you collect all the necessary items, then I can help you open the pathway between the mortal realm and the Underworld.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen got a lot less angry after seeing this message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since King Chujiang could open the path, it means that it was possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But lotus, holy water…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tell this sovereign where you’re supposed to get stuff like Nine Heart Lotus Roots and Holy Water of Yiyuan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Immortal Lady He of the Heavenly Court should have a Nine Heart Lotus Root, the Thousand Year Dragon Eye is the eye of a dragon with a thousand year of cultivation. Old Lord Taishang of the Heavenly Court should have the pill, as for the Holy Water of Yiyuan…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What about the Holy Water of Yiyuan?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang, who was sitting on his throne, licked his lips. </span><i><span style>You couldn’t find this Holy Water of Yiyuan at all.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>But from the looks of the master, he seems to be determined on reviving a person who died before their time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he said it…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This sovereign is asking you a question!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck, stop hurrying me.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang shouted in his heart, then clenched his teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>“Holy Water of Yiyuan can be gotten from soaking the Soul Pearl Yiyuan within the rootless water <a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> outside of the Moon Palace for forty-nine days.”</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>Soul Pearl Yiyuan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“King Chujiang, tell me, are there still any Soul Pearl Yiyuan in this world!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Drip.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cold sweat instantly flowed down from King Chujiang’s forehead. He knew that this master definitely knew about the information on Soul Pearl Yiyuan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master, what I said were the truth. However, it isn’t impossible to find Soul Pearl Yiyuan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then tell me how would you find it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Soul Pearl Yiyuan was in the four seas and both the place of extreme north as well as the burning hells of our Underworld, you can try…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang didn’t dare to say anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>F*ck, even he didn’t believe that they could be found.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ignoring the four seas, just how were they supposed to find that fragment in such a large place like the place of extreme north.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen reacted differently when he saw the message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Underworld had a fragment as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen opened his Treasure Chest of his WeChat. He had five fragments of Soul Pearl Yiyuan, the only piece he lacked was the Underworld’s piece.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You said that your Underworld has a fragment as well.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This master can’t be wanting it, right?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>To be honest, King Chujiang didn’t want to give it either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if it was just a fragment of Soul Pearl Yiyuan, it was an unmeasurable treasure. What’s more, the fragment wasn’t in the hands of them, the Ten Yama Kings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Our Underworld does have one.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Give it to me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen finally felt what it was like to be a bandit by directly asking for it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang cried.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It isn’t in my hands.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then who is it with!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s mood was a bit bad. This King Chujiang kept on giving him hope, then disappointing him. Was he trying to hurt him!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s with Ksitigarbha…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, go and ask Ksitigarbha for that fragment for me. If you don’t manage it…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sent a row of emojis with a bloodied knife.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do as you see fit.”</span></p>
