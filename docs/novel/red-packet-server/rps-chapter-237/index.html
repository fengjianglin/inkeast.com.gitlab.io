 <p><span style>Chapter 237 – Didn’t Only Reincarnate Once</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh? Tall Guy, you remembered some stuff!” Lu Lu’s face was full of joy as she grabbed Ye Zichen’s arm with both hands and exclaimed. “Then do you remember after that…”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I daydreamed again.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rubbed his hand, and subconsciously looked down at his arm…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck this!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the hell!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the hell is this sika deer beside me?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen quickly took his hand away and took a few steps back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What-What sort of monster are you! I’m telling you, the Great Sage Equaling Heaven is my bro, he’s a master at monster-slaying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While he spoke, the sika deer continued to walk towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stand there and don’t move, if you take another step forward, then I’m calling my bro. Have you heard about the story of hitting the white bone demon thrice? My bro won’t let you off.”</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>“Ye Zichen, what are you saying? I’m Lu Lu<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>.”</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know you’re a deer, you don’t need to emphasize it…”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ai, what, she said she’s Lu Lu?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen blinked. </span><i><span style>No matter how I look at it, it’s a sika deer, isn’t Lu Lu supposed to be human?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen subconsciously looked around the lobby…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Underwear of all colors were shown.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck, the Fiery Eyes of Truth has been activated.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen quickly deactivated the Fiery Eyes of Truth, then looked towards the sika deer. </span><i><span style>It really is Lu Lu.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You just called me a monster, I’m so sad!” Lu Lu frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen licked his lips and slowly moved towards her and asked with a testing tone just at the same time, “You’re a Yaoguai?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why do you ask?” Lu Lu tiled her head curiously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After quite a while, Ye Zichen replied, “I just saw you as a sika deer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah! You can see my true form!” Lu Lu’s exclamation was rather loud, causing many employees of the company to subconsciously look over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, Ye Zichen hurriedly ran over, covered her mouth and dragged her out of the building.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ummmmm…” Lu Lu, who’s mouth was covered, yelped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In order to prevent the surrounding bystanders from thinking that he was a criminal, Ye Zichen let go of his hand, then lifted his finger to his mouth. “Be quieter, those who live here are all mortal. Stuff like true form…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I understand,” Lu Lu giggled, then hugged Ye Zichen’s arm curiously. “Why can you see my true form? Isn’t your reincarnation in this life supposed to be a normal person?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I might have been a normal person a bit more than a month ago, and now, I don’t even know if I am human…” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes in annoyance, then glanced at Lu Lu. “What did you come here for? Don’t tell me that you came to find me. Even Su Yan and them doesn’t know about this place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Lu revealed a hint of pride when she heard that, and pointed at her own nose, “I came according to your smell.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“… Are you a dog? Your nose is actually so sensitive!” Ye Zichen revealed a look of speechlessness. </span><i><span style>Found me according to my smell? Even my family’s Lil’ White can’t find me according to my scent!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t care about it so much. Just know that I can find you,” Lu Lu smiled while her eyes turned the shape of a crescent moon. “Oh yeah, did you remember something just now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Think of what? I was just daydreaming. Now that I think about it, it’s rather weird, I’ve been having these weird dreams lately, “Ye Zichen smiled in self-mockery. “When I have time, I should go and have myself looked at in the hospital.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Recently, Ye Zichen felt like these weird dreams got more and more frequent. Previously, he would only have them when he slept at night, then he gradually started to have those dreams during daytime, and now, he pretty much gets those dreams every single day…</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>The dreams were always weird. He had seemingly been all sorts of characters in his dreams, like King Zhou of the Shang Dynasty<a id="footnoteref-2" href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>.</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Lu smiled, while her eyes revealed a meaningful look, “You weren’t dreaming. All of these were things you have experienced personally.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen furiously raised his eyebrows and looked at the smiling Lu Lu in shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Actually, you can pretty much guess it yourself, it’s just that you can’t explain it, nor can you say it to others, so you can only tell yourself that those are just dreams, right?” Lu Lu’s words resonated with Ye Zichen’s heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t anything if random scenes appeared in his mind once or twice, but quite a few times was a bit different.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, since Ye Zichen was unable to explain it, he could only keep telling himself that those were just daydreams or delusions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just why did all this happen?” Ye Zichen let out a long sigh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Lu pursed her lips and smiled, “Didn’t I tell you just now? You experienced all of this in person,” With that, she looked up at Ye Zichen’s stiffening face with a smile. “You asked me yesterday if people really have a previous life, right? Of course they do!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then why have I never had those dreams before?” Worry and panic filled Ye Zichen’s eyes due to his lack of understanding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Lu Lu answered irresponsibly towards this question, “How would I know? Normally speaking, a person would not gain their memories of their previous life, however, it’s not that they won’t remember anything. For example, important people from their previous life or important scenes might trigger some of their memories of their previous life. For example, you called me Guo Xiang earlier, so it seems like your memories are slowly awakening!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was stunned.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This is too strange.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>If the scene in my mind was something that I personally experienced, then that mean that I was Zhang Junbao in my previous life!?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just who was Zhang Junbao? He is Zhang Sanfeng, Great Immortal Zhang, who established the Wudang Sect!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ha!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who had a stunned look, suddenly laughed, then looked towards Lu Lu, “I’m Zhang Sanfeng’s reincarnation? F*ck, that’s too awesome!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Lu couldn’t help but facepalm when she saw Ye Zichen’s idiotic look. </span><i><span style>They truly are the same person, he’s exactly the same as he was in my previous life.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait, that’s not right!” Ye Zichen, who was emerged in him being Zhang Sanfeng’s reincarnation, suddenly reacted. “Guo Xiang is human, right? You… don’t seem to be human.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“None of your business,” Lu Lu rolled her eyes at Ye Zichen, then shouted. “Daddy Zhi Xin, this guy keeps on asking me some questions that can’t be answered!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhi Xin: Ye Zichen, you ask too many questions, it seems like you don’t want your lunch box anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Daddy, I know my wrongs. I’ll act properly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhi Xin: Okay. Gaffer, get ready for the next shot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I could never have imagined that I’m actually Zhang Sanfeng’s reincarnation,” A flower bloomed on Ye Zichen’s face. Although he was still unable to accept it all, it was better to be optimistic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wasn’t someone that liked to split hairs, going by the flow was the best.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Actually, I know another secret about you,” Lu Lu suddenly spoke up mysteriously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows, “What secret?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He gave in. </span><i><span style>I’ll just find out today everything I should know.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>So I don’t need to be stunned in the future.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Actually, you didn’t only reincarnate once!”</span></p>

 <p><em>I daydreamed again.</em></p>
 <p>Ye Zichen rubbed his hand, and subconsciously looked down at his arm…</p>
 <p><em>F*ck this!</em></p>
 <p><em>What the hell!</em></p>
 <p><em>What the hell is this sika deer beside me?</em></p>
 <p>Ye Zichen quickly took his hand away and took a few steps back.</p>
 <p>“What-What sort of monster are you! I’m telling you, the Great Sage Equaling Heaven is my bro, he’s a master at monster-slaying.</p>

 <p>“Stand there and don’t move, if you take another step forward, then I’m calling my bro. Have you heard about the story of hitting the white bone demon thrice? I bro won’t let you off.”</p>
 <p>“Ye Zichen, what are you saying? I’m Lu Lu[1. The surname of Lu Lu (鹿璐) - 鹿, means deer].”</p>
