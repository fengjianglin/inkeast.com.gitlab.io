 <p><span style>“Boss Ye, you might cause trouble by doing that,” Li Minghu raised his eyebrows slightly as he looked at the fleeing Han Qi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How come? Does Boss Hu think that Han Qi can actually do something to me?” To be frank, Ye Zichen truly didn’t take this sort of brainless young master who only knew how to bully people by using his family’s status seriously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You naturally would not need to worry if it was just Han Qi,” Li Minghu frowned. “What worries me more is Han Qi’s older brother, Han Yu!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Han Yu?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!” Li Minghu nodded. “Han Yu is the first young master of the Han family, and one of the more famous young masters. He is capable and resolute. He isn’t someone that the trash, Han Qi, can compare up to.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You feel like he would do something to the company?” Ye Zichen smiled faintly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“His relationship with Han Qi doesn’t seem all that good, but no matter what, Han Qi is from the Han family. Han Yu might help his little brother get even just to put on a show for his elders. I know that Boss Ye knows Young Master Su, but the military doesn’t get involved into politics…” Li Minghu looked at Ye Zichen meaningfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Ye Zichen smiled, “When the water rises, we’ll use earth to dam it; when the soldiers arrive, we’ll use a general to ward them off. Don’t fret!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Ye Zichen told the Hou brothers by Xiao Yumei’s side to protect her safety, Ye Zichen left the medical company and called Su Yiyun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi, do you have some important matters for you to find me so urgently?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen and Su Yiyun sat by the window in a drinks store near Polytechnic University. Both of them held a glass of watermelon juice in their hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What, can’t I find you, my brother-in-law, if there isn’t anything?” Ye Zichen smiled playfully, then got serious. “I do indeed have stuff to say to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I knew it. Say it, what do you need my help with?” Su Yiyun smiled faintly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Some issues came up with the medical company,” Ye Zichen frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Another issue!?” Su Yiyun was stunned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had just gotten the paperwork for the medical company done a few days ago, and now another issue arose.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems like this company I have shares in truly does get into a lot of trouble. If this continues to happen, I might have to withdraw my investment. Say it, what issue came up with the medical company again?” Su Yiyun smiled helplessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Han Qi wants to buy shares with one yuan!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The disappointing grandson of the Han family?” Su Yiyun raised his eyebrows and twitched his mouth. “One yuan, he truly has a huge appetite. Ignore this grandson, he’ll stop after I find time to beat him up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I already beat him up!” Ye Zichen shrugged. “I broke three of his fingers!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun blanked out for a moment. Then after a long while, he raised his eyebrows and raised his thumb at Ye Zichen, “Amazing, you truly are brave. When I said beat him up, I meant just kicking him a few times at most, you actually dared to break his fingers.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? It’s a lot of trouble? Ye Zichen licked his lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun shook his head, then nodded, “It’s not exactly trouble. Han Qi doesn’t have much of a position in the Han family. He’s just a hippy, and the people in his family don’t really care about him. What I’m worried about is that brat, Han Yu, trying to get even for his trash of a little brother. Han Yu isn’t a normal threat. However, there isn’t much to worry about. With me here, he doesn’t dare to do all that much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m rather interested in Han Yu,” Ye Zichen squinted his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This brat is on the same level as me, he can use a part of his family’s powers and has a good amount of backing. What’s more, this brat is rather capable, and rather dark. Even when he laughs with you on the surface, the dirty tricks he uses behind your back are going to catch you off guard,” Su Yiyun twitched his mouth and snorted. It was clear that he wasn’t a fan of people like Han Yu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I even lost to him several years ago!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then why didn’t you get Old Man Su to deal with him?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows. From what he knew about Old Man Su, that person was definitely a super protective person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re kidding, right? Our circles have an unspoken rule, which is us not being allowed to go to our parents. If you can mess with the others, then do it, if you can’t, then just submit. Getting the parents involved is way too embarrassing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I, this puny civilian, does not understand your world,” Ye Zichen twitched his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun laughed, “Stop pretending. My dad told me that your identity is seriously mysterious. Oh yeah, how are you getting on with my lil’ sister?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Her and I…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s expression immediately stiffened before he finished his sentence, when he saw the pretty figure behind Su Yiyun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled wryly and let out a sigh before raising his eyebrows, “Why did you come again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just following you and protecting you,” Lu Lu smiled, then tiptoed beside Ye Zichen, before sitting down. At the same time, she blinked towards Su Yiyun and smiled, “Hello, it’s my first time meeting you. Are you Ye Zichen’s friend?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun squished the cup is in his hands, while he smiled towards Ye Zichen with interrogating eyes, “Bro, if you continue on like this, then it is really hard on me as the older brother!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? You two are brothers?” Lu Lu blinked her large watery eyes, reached her hand out towards Su Yiyun with a smile. “Hi, I’m Ye Zichen’s classmate and his girlfriend in his previous life, Lu Lu!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe!” Su Yiyun laughed coldly, then twitched his mouth at Ye Zichen with a meaningful smile. “Ye-zi, you’re pretty amazing. Your girl friend from your previous life has appeared. When you continue, wouldn’t the ones from your last last life and your last last last life… You really think my little sister is easy to bully!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uhm…”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I don’t want it to happen either… </span></i><span style>Just as Ye Zichen thought about how to explain this problem…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Buzz!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The phone in Ye Zichen’s pocket rang. Ye Zichen took out his phone and couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows when he saw the caller ID.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mom, you were looking for me?” The moment he received Ye Rong’s phone call, Ye Zichen returned to the mansion as fast as he could.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A SUV parked outside the mansion, which was most likely the Kind Killer, Mu Jinglei’s, car from the looks of the license plate number.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pushed open the door. He saw Mu Jinglei crying streams of tears in the living room, while Ye Rong patted her shoulders with a worrisome expression beside her…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mom, Lei-jie.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Lil’ White ran over with his tongue out. Mother Ye also looked up. When she saw Lu Lu…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her expression tensed!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sighed when he noticed Mother Ye’s expression..</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they were coming over, she already told her not to follow, but the girl refused to listen!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That’s great. </span></i><span style>Now, in Mother Ye’s thoughts, there will be another candidate for her daughter-in-law.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In order to avoid unnecessary awkwardness, Ye Zichen quickly changed the topic, “Mom, you said it in quite a bit of hurry just now. You said that you need three million for something!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen!” Mu Jinglei’s eyes were red from crying. She bit her lips as she fiddled with her hands…</span></p>
 <p><span style>She struggled quite a bit in her heart. Three million was no small sum for anyone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But she had no other choice!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can you lend three million to sis?”</span></p>
