 <p><span style>Chapter 726 – You are far better than me at plotting</span></p>
 <p><span style>The uncaring attitude caused Li Min’e to feel rather worried for Su Yiyun,</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Li was no longer the same as before. He was now extremely tough with powerful aids. She was truly afraid that Gu Li would kill Su Yiyun in anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The three inhuman beings blocking off the demon elites also looked towards Gu Li.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, Gu Li merely shook his head, causing the three to turn back towards the Demon Sovereigns.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Li nodded with a smile, then lifted his arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Min’e nearly cried out for Su Yiyun to be careful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will respect your decision.” However, Gu Li only patted Su Yiyun’s shoulders, then tried to give him a hug.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun continued to stand still without any intention to respond.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Li did not get angry. He moved aside. “I hope you will not regret your decision today.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Allow me to return the same words to you,” Su Yiyun finally replied. “I have to at least try to remind you. Although your method of strengthening yourself is fast, but it is against the nature of the world. You still have time to stop if you are willing to do so.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thanks for your concern,” Gu Li nodded. “But I want to continue on my own path using my own method.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun nodded, then walked towards Black Dragon and the rest of the demons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The three beings stopped Su Yiyun just like they stopped the demons, but moved aside when Gu Li shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go,” said Su Yiyun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go? This is the land of the demons. Are we supposed to leave this place to him!?” The first ranking Demon Sovereign snorted. He never liked Su Yiyun and never would. The only thing he wanted to do was cause trouble for Su Yiyun. “I bet you’re just in cohorts and want to take over the place us demons built up for ten thousand years. Dream on!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then stay here,” Su Yiyun didn’t argue. He merely raised his eyebrows at Black Dragon. “Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure.” To everybody’s surprise, Black Dragon agreed without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A Demon Sovereign voiced out his confusion, “My Lord, why are we leaving? What force can that brat Gu Li have with him? Although we lost some troops in the Three Realms, we might not have actually lose if we fought to the death.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Indeed my lord, don’t fall into the evil person’s plot,” said the first ranking Demon Sovereign.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I cannot take the risks any longer,” Black Dragon seemed to age even more after saying that. “These soldiers are our only hope in the future, I cannot make them take any more risks for me. Do they not all have families?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My Lord!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop,” Black Dragon interrupted the Demon Sovereign without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, although they were displeased with his decision, they could only follow in tow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kids, it’s time to send out guests off,” Gu Li clapped his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon a huge swarm of beings appeared behind Gu Li, darkening the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the demons looked up and saw what was there…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>We’re lucky that we didn’t fight.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their defeat in the Three Realms and the conquering of their base caused the demons to be in a very sour mood. They could only stand at the entrance to the spatial wormhole in confusion. All of a sudden, they didn’t know where they were supposed to go next.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I did set up a space with spiritual formations during the past six months. Although it’s rather small, it should be enough for us to live in,” said Su Yiyun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please,” Black Dragon bowed earnestly. The truth was that if it was not for Su Yiyun, even he was not sure where he was supposed to lead his subordinates to next.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Here you go,” Su Yiyun threw a ring to Black Dragon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A look of confusion surfaced on the receiver’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Here are our resources. I felt that Gu Li wanted to take over the base quite a while ago, so I started to collect some of our resources. Although I couldn’t gather everything, it should be enough for us to live off on.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This…” Suddenly, Black Dragon wasn’t sure of what to say.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even the Demon Sovereigns who were suspicious of Su Yiyun tossed their doubts away..</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Cohorts?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>If he was really in cohorts with Gu Li, then he didn’t have to give these resources back.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Master Su, you are the savior of the entire demon race,” Black Dragon bowed deeply, while the demons also follow suit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun nodded indifferently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Gu Li couldn’t help but smirk when he watched everything unfold from afar, “You really are far better than me when it comes to plotting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“From today onwards, Master Su is of the same level as me. Treat Master Su as you would me. Understood?” Black Dragon swept his gaze over everyone and left his gaze on the first ranking Demon Sovereign a while longer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He knew that the first ranking Demon Sovereign didn’t get along with Su Yiyun and if that demon dared to do anything in the future, Black Dragon would definitely discard him without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood,” the demons all answered together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s no need for that, let us be like before. What’s more, I’m just going to focus on researching spiritual formations, I only ask Lord Black Dragon to provide me with the resources needed,” Su Yiyun smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon immediately agreed. “No problem, Master Su and I shall share this ring from now on. Please just take what you need from it without reporting to me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then allow me to express my gratitude.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master Su, you are too courteous.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>For Black Dragon, the resources were not just resources, they were his hope of bringing the demons back to their peak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As long as these resources last us until the Demon Realm’s messenger arrives, then we will definitely fight our way back to the Three Realms. I’ll also make Gu Li pay the price!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Messenger? Su Yiyun frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master Su, the situation is like…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon explained the information without any hesitation. He already had complete trust in Su Yiyun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“After the messenger arrives, I will definitely put in a few good words for Master Su.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then allow me to give you my gratitude in advance.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master Su, you are too courteous. Us demons value people proficient in formations very highly. You will be treated extremely well even if you ascend. I will merely be introducing you,” Black Dragon replied with a smile. Then, he recalled the three people who had blocked their way.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>They didn’t seem like the living, but nor were they like the dead….</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But they were extremely strong. That is… strange.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Master Su, do you know anything about Gu Li’s three subordinates…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, them? I was going to talk to you about them as well. Do you know about the Four Primordial Zombie Progenitors?”</span></p>

 <p>Alright, I screwed up with time management real bad. Between the interview (which you should be able to see soon on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVfwsgGqyOWpJFwG6dpVgxg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Immortal Index's channel</a>), permanent overtime at work and family, I didn't find time to TL RPS at all (which means my&nbsp;stockpile ran out). Thus, I'm not going to be able to release any of the owed/sponsored chapters for you today. What I will be doing though is making sure that I TL at least 2 SMTM and 1 RPS chapter per day on weekdays and more on the weekends so slowly catch back up. Also, I'll be keeping count of how many RPS chapters I owe you guys so I can make it all up to you guys when I go back to Switzerland.&nbsp;<em>I also thought that I release Chapter 722 yesterday, but apparently, I haven't...</em></p>
 <p>Owed Chapters Count: 5 (+sponsored chapters)</p>
