 <p><span style>Chapter 289 – Xie Bian’s Red Packet</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s hand that was holding the cigarette shook, while he instinctively took a step back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s eyes twitched intensely as he looked at the enraged Yu…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have you gone mad!? What are you doing!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was about to have a mental break down. </span><i><span style>Just what the hell is going on!?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>He’s biting the hand that fed him!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Did I meet some evil thing recently? Why do people keep wanting to kill me...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll take your dog life!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Yu dived towards Ye Zichen like a shadow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you want my dog’s life, then go and find Lil’ White. Why are you coming after me…” Ye Zichen shrunk his neck and cursed softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ White, who was resting in the mansion, suddenly sneezed, “Who is talking about me behind my back!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ White was rather speechless, but Ye Zichen, who was frantically evading Yu’s attacks, felt even more speechless.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I had treated his niece with goodwill, and he had promised that he wouldn’t cause any more trouble for me.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just how long has it been? He’s coming to kill me again.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Since Ye Zichen noticed that the Hou brothers were not around, after dodging a few of Yu’s attacks, Ye Zichen licked his lips and stopped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn’t want to fight you, don’t reject face when given it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Yu merely laughed coldly in response as the dagger in his hands shimmered.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>He really thinks that laozi is easy to push around.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen formed a fist with his right hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since he did not know any spiritual techniques or secret arts, he merely swung his fist decisively.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Absolute strength trumps all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoever is the strongest when fighting is the winner. </span><i><span style>There is no point of having those flowery techniques.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The eyes of Yu, who stood opposite him, twitched when he saw this before he swung his fist out as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A loud noise echoed in the alleyway.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the fists of the two collided, a torrent of wind caused by spiritual energy instantly spread out with the contact point of the two fists at the center…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crack…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pavement underneath their feet started to crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cough…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu spat out a mouthful of blood, then retracted his fists with a shocked look. He glanced at Ye Zichen in surprise for a split second before leaping back and disappearing from the street.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Seriously, what an ungrateful person.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen flung his arm bitterly. Ye Zichen immediately felt rather sorry for himself when he thought of how much he had done for Yu.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>People should have a conscience. Could his conscience have been eaten by a dog?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, Ye Zichen snorted coldly before turning away. However, what Ye Zichen did not notice was that the mouthful of blood that Yu coughed up…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was not red like a normal person’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen sat down in a cold drinks store to rest, he habitually took out his phone and opened up the Underworld staff chat, which was unusually very active.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He took a careful look…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s actually Xie Bian’s birthday!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ox-Head: What sorts of presents has everyone prepared? Could you guys leak it for Old Ox?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Horse-Face: Big Brother Ox-Head is right.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Judge Cui: @Ox-Head, how about Marshal Ox telling us first?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hua Tuo: This old man isn’t capable at anything except medical stuff.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang: @Hua Tuo, Elder Hua is too humble. You can stand atop of everyone with merely your medical skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that the Ten Yama Kings were in the group as well, Ye Zichen started to get nervous.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>If King Chujiang notices me, then would he report me and kick me out of the group?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Bian: Brothers.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wow.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Bian actually spoke up! That alone caused the enter group to be filled with surprise, and even Ye Zichen was shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stared closely at the screen as his screen started to become flooded with messages.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Judge Cui: Marshal Xie! Why did you come!?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hua Tuo: General Xie, what a rare guest!</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang: Why isn’t Brother Xie being a good birthday boy and actually has the spare time to speak up in the group?</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Lunhui: Old Xie spoke up?</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Pingdeng: Old Xie, it really has been a long time. Come visit me when you have time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lady Meng[1. Old Lady Meng (孟婆) is the being in the 10</span><span style>th</span><span style> hall of the underworld who ensures that the spirits that are going to reincarnate do not remember their past lives.]: Greetings to Marshal Xie.</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>Zhong Kui<a id="footnoteref-2" href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>: I wish Marshal Xie a limitless lifespan. Marshal Xie, do send a red packet.</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>Ox-Head: Brother Xie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Horse-Face: Big Brother Ox-Head is right!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen could clearly feel Ox-Head’s depressed mood. That was something he immediately understood after thinking about it. </span><i><span style>No matter what, Ox-Head was a Ghost Marshal of the Underworld.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But look at the reaction to Xie Bian’s entrance, which summoned up quite a few Yama Kings, and even those officials that didn’t speak much in the group spoke up.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Yet, look at Ox-Head’s entrance.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Maybe everyone is just too familiar with him since he speaks up in the group every single day.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Bian: I feel rather nervous when I see your intimacy. &lt;insert a row of sweating expressions&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lady Meng: Marshal Xie is too funny.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang: Old Xie @Xie Bian. Don’t say that I, your brother, didn’t remind you. You should hold your birthday feast, but it has to be quick.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Bian: Why?</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Lunhui: @Xie Bian, did you forget that Big Brother King Qinguang was taken away by the Heavenly Court?</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Pengdeng: Indeed. The Heavenly Court is watching us rather closely. Old Xie needs to be careful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Bian: Sigh, just that? What can they do? What can the Heavenly Court do to laozi for holding a birthday feast? I, Xie Bian, do not have the word “submit” in my dictionary. Going against the flow is real temper!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhong Kui: Boss Xie has a fierce temper.</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>Old Lady Meng: Marshal Xie, worst come to worst, just come to me and drink the Soul-Breaking Soup<a id="footnoteref-3" href="#footnote-3">[3]</a> to start over.</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>Ox-Head: Be careful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Horse-Face: Big Brother Ox-Head is right!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Bian: I know you’re all saying it for my own good. I was just kidding, don’t take it seriously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang: Ignoring that, why did you come over here when it’s your birthday?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Bian: Ha, I came to spread a bit of wealth.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Spread wealth.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is he going to send red packets?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>That wasn’t something that only Ye Zichen thought of, it was something that the entire staff chat thought of.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhong Kui: I smell the scent of red packets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lady Meng: Wait a second, let me finish this bowl of soup…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hua Tuo: This old man can’t compete against those youngsters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Judge Cui: I really look forward to Marshal Xie’s red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately focused completely on his phone as he waited for the red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s phone vibrated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When a huge red packet appeared on the screen, Ye Zichen reacted swiftly…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Snatch!</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received Xie Bian’s red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bone Ring x1</span></p>
 <p><span style>Judge Cui: Marshal Xie is generous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hua Tuo: I never would have thought that even this old man managed to grab one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhong Kui: Boss Xie, thank you for your red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lady Peng: Let us dance after making a toast with this bowl of soup…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen subconsciously took a look at everyone else’s luck, which mostly consisted of some sort of special fruit or sigils…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Judging based on the name of the item, Ye Zichen felt that the Bone Ring should be equipment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He clicked on his Yinyang Box.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An ancient ring laid within.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bone Ring: An item Xie Bian picked up in a mountain of corpses in the mortal realm when he first became a Ghost Marshal. He only chose to bring it back to the Underworld after seeing that it was rather extraordinary. This item was created in the time of the Five Emperors, and its exact functions are yet to be known…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Not only is this an equippable accessory, it's actually an unidentified equipment.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen still chose to take out the Bone Ring due to his curiosity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Bone Ring was of a skeletal white band with a small skull on top. If one was merely judging from its appearance, it really was nothing special…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen put it on his finger, then…</span></p>
 <p><span style>A call suddenly pealed through in the cold drinks store.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Li Jiayi!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The familiar name caused Ye Zichen to look up, but at that very moment, the eyes of the skull on the Bone Ring that rested on his left index finger emitted a ghostly blue light that went unnoticed by him.</span></p>
 <p></p>

 <p></p>
 <p>Dear Diary,</p>
 <p>Can someone tell me what the f*ck was wrong with Yu? He was all nice and friendly before and even promised me that his life was mine, and now?</p>
 <p>He actually came to kill me again.</p>
 <p>And it was for f*cking real!</p>
 <p>Like c'mon dude, I helped you get your niece's soul back, so even if you do want to kill me, cut me some slack and just leave me alone like you promised!</p>
 <p>It was kinda strange for him to pretty much act like how he acted before I helped him, but ugh. What an ungrateful bastard. Also, he ran away pretty quickly this time, so maybe he knows that he isn't able to kill me? I suppose it matters not, with my current power, he won't be able to kill me since I can subdue him all by myself.</p>
 <p>But man, it is going to be super annoying though...</p>
