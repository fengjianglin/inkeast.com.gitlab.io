 <p><span style>Chapter 474 – Shi Qian the Thief</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>See that? There really was someone that came to rob the auction!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but to roll his eyes. He really didn’t care about it that much, the thief could go and rob whoever he wanted. Ye Zichen just wanted to quickly leave with his Barrier Breaking Grass.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person who dared to rob the auction house was definitely not any normal person. Ye Zichen was not interested in fighting that guy at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop blanking out. Hurry up and give me the Barrier Breaking Grass. I’m leaving after getting that,” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows and said to the staff in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, everyone from Treasure Tower was shocked. After all, something like a wrecking an auction has never happened in several thousand years.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Someone really came to rob the auction,” the person who exclaimed was no other than the bearded man sitting beside Ye Zichen. He glanced over at Ye Zichen in shock…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t look at me. I’m not part of such a group,” Ye Zichen shrugged, then immediately hurried the staff members again to hand the Barrier Breaking Grass over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, at that very moment, the Barrier Breaking Grass in the staff’s plate flew up uncontrollably, while the auction items that other staff held did the same.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked up, then saw a man holding a rucksack, which the auction items flew towards. on the ceiling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You dare!?” the bearded man suddenly scolded the thief loudly. Then, he, who was originally of the Spiritual Body level, instantly released spiritual pressure above a Human Immortal’s. “You’ve truly got guts for daring to rob the Treasure Tower.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, he flew over to the man. This change of events shocked Ye Zichen as well. </span><i><span style>I truly never expected the bearded guy beside me was one of the Treasure Tower’s experts.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha, there is no treasure that I, Shi Qian, fails to get if I’m interested in it,” the man on the ceiling smiled evilly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen felt rather speechless when he heard the name. </span><i><span style>Shi Qian, what a familiar name.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I seem to recall that the master thief from the 108 outlaws in Water Margin was called Shi Qian!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Shi Qian, it’s actually him!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Liang and Zuo Mo suddenly appeared beside Ye Zichen. The person who spoke up was Zuo Mo. At that moment, her eyebrows knitted tightly together, revealing the worry in her heart clearly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t care about Shi Qian or whoever he is. That brat took the Barrier Breaking Grass, so shouldn’t the auction house compensate me ten strands?” Ye Zichen replied shamelessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Mo immediately rolled her eyes, “Why should I? Your item was a gift from Elder Shao, and you actually want us to compensate you for it? Just wait. If you can snatch it back, then snatch it. If you can’t, then there’s nothing I can do!” Zuo Mo shrugged and put on an expression as if she wasn’t able to do anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was completely speechless when he heard her reply.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So the Tower actually works like this!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Women are truly the creatures you should definitely not offend in this world. I merely ignored her before, is there a need to go against me in everything?”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Zuo Liang, go and contact the rest of security. Since Shi Qian has acted, then A’lei himself will not be enough to stop him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as Zuo Mo had said. The bearded man was not able to do anything to Shi Qian at all. The other party was as agile as a monkey and directly nullified all attacks made against him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, the auctioned items from Treasure Tower also continuously flew into his rucksack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There truly is someone not afraid of death. It seems like our old bones are going to have to move a little,” thee more old men appeared in the sky. Judging from the spiritual pressure they released from their bodies, they seemed like experts of at least the Human Immortal level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are bullying me with numbers? Grandpa isn’t going to play with you anymore,”</span></p>
 <p><span style>By that moment, the majority of the auctioned items had already entered his rucksack. When he saw that more and more people came to capture him, he finally judged it the time to retreat, so he tied the rucksack up, and got ready to run.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My Barrier Breaking Grass!” Ye Zichen stomped his feet anxiously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment, Yang Jian and Taibai Jinxing, who dressed in plain clothes suddenly appeared in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, long time no see,” Yang Jian immediately bear hugged him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Taibai Jinxing also nodded with a soft smile, “You actually came to the Three Realms as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You finally came!” Ye Zichen finally saw his savior in Yang Jian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The thief who stole his Barrier Breaking Grass was also a Human Immortal. However, he was very agile, and was actually able to not let his enemies get the upper hand even when ganged up upon by four or five Human Immortals.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that Shi Qian was about to run away with the treasures, Ye Zichen hurriedly said, “Yang Jian, you see that suspicious looking guy? Go and snatch his bag. He stole my Barrier Breaking Grass.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Barrier Breaking Grass!” Yang Jian was stunned, then he immediately revealed an angry look. “He truly doesn’t want to live anymore. He actually stole my brother’s treasure!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The spiritual pressure of a Sky Immortal instantly radiated out from his body, causing Shi Qian and the Treasure Tower members, who were fighting, to raise their eyebrows when they felt it.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Sky Immortal?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>He’s not from our Treasure Tower, could it be this thief’s…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Qian also felt it, causing an anxious look to surface on his face. </span><i><span style>I can mess with Human Immortal level people, but I really can’t beat a Sky Immortal.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Running is the best choice out of the thirty-six stratagems!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Qian took out a few smoke bombs from his pocket and threw it out, before beginning to run.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You want to run?” a huge pair of hands suddenly appeared out of the air, and directly captured Shi Qian. At this moment, Yang Jian also walked over with squinted eyes and snorted. “Trying to run from this lord? You really are not taking this lord seriously!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahh, my lord, just what are you saying?” Shi Qiann forced a smile. “How could I not dare to take you seriously? You are from the Treasure Tower? Ha, I was just kidding with you guys, don’t mind it too much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Treasure Tower?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You aren’t from Treasure Tower?” Shi Qian’s eyes instantly lit up. “Then you just want to make a fortune, right? What a coincidence, me too. Look, how about we split the things half-half?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Qian took a look at Yang Jian’s expression. </span><i><span style>He doesn’t seem that satisfied…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Eighty-twenty. Eighty for you, twenty for me!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Still not satisfied!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Ninety-ten. Everyone came to make a fortune. I, the little brother, did plenty of work as well, so just treat it like payment for hard work!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop bullshitting with laozi. Give the bag in your hands to me,” Yang Jian frowned. That was what Ye Zichen had asked for. After all, the bag seemed like a good treasure, and Yang Jian definitely couldn’t have acted for nothing, so he chose the bag.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Qian instantly wanted to cry when he heard that. Not only did the treasures he came to steal get taken, his treasured bag had to be given away too.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since the difference between Yang Jian’s and his strength was far too great, he didn’t dare to refuse either, so he bit his lips and handed the bag over to Yang Jian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright now, scram!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Qian quickly ran away dejectedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Yang Jian also waved the bag in his hands proudly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was at that moment that the guards Zuo Liang went to call finally arrived. When they saw Yang Jian alone in the skies while holding the bag, which had grabbed the treasures, they immediately branded him as the thief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Put down the bag in your hands. Otherwise, die!” the guards said coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian immediately got angry when he heard that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He squinted his eyes and scanned the ten-odd guards around him, then snorted, “Just with you guys?”</span></p>

 <p><b>Beard Guy:&nbsp;</b>What!?</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>See? I told you.</p>
 <p><strong>Beard Guy:&nbsp;</strong>(grabs Ye Zichen's shoulders)&nbsp;Do you know something!? Why did you know that someone was going to rob this auction!?</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen;&nbsp;</strong>Dude, isn't it obvious? You have so many valuable things here, people are naturally going to get greedy. What's more, there are all sorts of thieves out there. Haven't you heard of Kaito Kid? Or maybe Lupin III? These "impossible to steal from" situations are ones they love most!</p>
 <p><strong>Beard Guy:&nbsp;</strong>Who are they?</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>(facepalm) Ugh, I forgot that you wouldn't get the references. Uhm.. .Then... what about Shi Qian? You know.. That famous thief from the Water Margin?</p>
 <p><strong>Beard Guy:&nbsp;</strong>Shi Qian...</p>
 <p><strong>Voice A:&nbsp;</strong>Ahahahaha, so many treasures. Just to the liking of I, Shi Qian!</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>...</p>
 <p><strong>Beard Guy:&nbsp;</strong>Are you still going to say that you aren't related to the robber?</p>
