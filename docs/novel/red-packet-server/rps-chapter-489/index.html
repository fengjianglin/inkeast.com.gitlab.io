 <p><span style>Chapter 489 – White Jade Pendant</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yellow Hair, who had endured another round of Blue Lotus Fairy’s “loving touch”, finally calmed down, so he followed Ye Zichen and Stone Fairy with a forced smile. As for his beaten up subordinates…</span></p>
 <p><span style>In his own words, “who cares about them now that I found my group”.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Blue Lotus, only you can become the makeup lesson’s teacher. Of course, you won’t be working for nothing. How about a sixty-forty split on the income?” As they walked, Ye Zichen continuously tried to brainwash Blue Lotus, but he really didn’t have any other ideas if she were to disagree.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fifty-fifty!” Blue Lotus Fairy raised her eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen squinted his eyes with a smile. “Deal. You can go and get the necessary starting funds to establish the makeup academy. You will be the principal if it develops well!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I really didn’t expect you to have connections with that geezer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are still plenty of things that you don’t expect,” Ye Zichen smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blue Lotus Fairy also smiled, “Sure, then come over to the Heavenly Court when you have time. I really want to see just how complex your network of connections is!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Blue Lotus Fairy floated away. However, all deities from the Heavenly Court would arrive and leave hurriedly, mostly because they were in the Immortal Region.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Anyone from the Heavenly Court who arrives in the Immortal Region would be watched. Thus, in order to prevent unnecessary trouble. They were unable to stay for too long.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, what were you talking about with the beauty? Yue Lao, Heavenly Court… Are those deities?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had nearly forgotten that he still had an idiot beside him. </span><i><span style>I suppose, since he has arrived in the Three Realms, I should help him understand the situation here, but I’m worried that he wouldn’t get it with his intelligence.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm, they’re deities,” Ye Zichen replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yellow Hair immediately nodded his understanding, “In that case, Boss, since you know Yue Lao, why don’t you start a matchmaking agency? Isn’t he in charge of marriage and relationships?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, kid, you think pretty quickly!” Ye Zichen praised. Even though he had known Yue Lao for so long, Ye Zichen had never even thought in that direction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you for the praise Boss!” Yellow Hair laughed idiotically, then asked vigilantly. “Boss, is this Namek? I’ve seen quite a few people with superpowers these few days. Was it because my actions on Earth had gained the acceptance of the higher-ups, so they sent me over here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But this is strange. Why haven’t anyone come to find me even after being here for so long? Am I actually officially in the organization now or not? Do I have any insurance? Also, this seems to be different from what happened in Dragon Ball!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Should I say as expected of you? </span></i><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but to shake his head with a weird smile. </span><i><span style>The fact that someone with his level of intelligence actually managed to live so long here is a miracle.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But I suppose it’s normal. Normal people wouldn’t recklessly cross him after detecting his False Earth Immortal level of strength.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just how should I explain it in a way that he understands?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“This isn’t Namek. This is a planet that Namek has only just starting to develop. Due to your assistance of helping me defeat the android on Earth, the higher ups are very happy with you. That’s why they decided to let you come here in order to continue their observation of you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yellow Hair’s expression instantly turned solemn, and smacked his chest with his right fist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I willingly accept the organization’s second round of observations. I am willing to sacrifice myself for the Super Saiyans!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ahem…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen patted Yellow Hair’s shoulder, then said with a look as if he was happy to hear Yellow Hair’s reply, “Sure. I will put in more good words for you with the organization.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, thank you for your care and grooming. I will definitely not disappoint you. I wish the Super Saiyan Family to exist for eternity!” Yellow Hair’s face was filled with solemnity and seriousness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but question himself when he saw Yellow Hair’s serious look. </span><i><span style>Is it really a good thing to lie to this fanboy?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen scratched his head, then raised his eyebrows as he asked, “Oh yeah, how did you get here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was asleep, then when I woke up, I was already here,” Yellow Hair scratched his head. “Someone told me to follow a person while I was sleeping. He also said that I was some general or something! Ha, I might have watched too many historical drama, but basically, I was already here when I woke up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Yellow Hair finished explaining what had happened to him, Xuan-Yuan Sword, which laid dormant in Ye Zichen’s arm, suddenly started to shake intensely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, Xuan-Yuan Xiang appeared, completely shocking Yellow Hair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My god, why did someone suddenly pop up?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can see me?” Xuan-Yuan Xiang’s face was covered with a solemn expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yellow Hair rolled his eyes speechlessly, “Do you think that I’m blind? Do you need me to tell you your three sizes?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You really can see her?” Ye Zichen asked. </span><i><span style>Xuan-Yuan Xiang was in her spiritual form, other people shouldn’t be able to see her.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, why are you asking that as well? Why wouldn’t I be able to see her!?” Yellow Hair asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xuan-Yuan Xiang immediately spoke to Ye Zichen in his mind, “Ask him what general did that person tell him he was in his dream!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“… Don’t tell me that he might be the reincarnation of one of my followers!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The chances of it being true are above eighty percent!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen felt like he was about to break down when he heard Xuan-Yuan Xiang’s reply of seriousness and certainty.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Can I get a few more followers? Seriously, what am I supposed to do with just a Dragon Ball fanboy?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen scratched his nose, then asked helplessly, “What general were you in your dream?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think I was called Lin Meng in my dream?” Yellow Hair scratched his head as he tried to remember. “I don’t remember too clearly. Boss, why are you asking about that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then did you have a white jade pendant beside you when you woke up…?” Xuan-Yuan Xiang asked nervously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yellow Hair rolled his eyes, then immediately nodded, “Yea, but I sold it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pa.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xuan-Yuan Xiang grabbed him by the collar, and put on a terrifying expression, completely scaring Yellow Hair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You said you sold it!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-Yes! What was I supposed to do if I didn’t? I didn’t have any money on me. I can’t exactly starve to death, right? I coincidentally met a gramps, who seemed to collect trash, so I sold it to him for ten bucks! But then I found a bandit hideout, which provided me with food and shelter. I still have the ten bucks with me!” with that, Yellow Hair took out the ten celeste from his pocket.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he saw Xuan-Yuan Xiang’s expression, which looked like she was going to eat him alive, he handed the celeste over with a trembling hand, “Here. The money I sold it for is all here. If you want, then I’ll give it all to you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The heck do I want it for!?” Xuan-Yuan Xiang rolled her eyes, then walked beside him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen saw her gloomy expression, “What, what’s the problem?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xuan-Yuan Xiang glared, then twitched her mouth with a snort, “The problem’s huge. Heh, you’re going to have a ton to do now. Start searching for it. If you don’t find the jade pendant, then we’re all screwed, and nobody will be able to escape.”</span></p>
