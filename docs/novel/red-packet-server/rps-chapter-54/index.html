 <p><span style>Chapter 54 – The Script shouldn’t be like this!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ploy!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>This was definitely a ploy!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>At the beginning, Ye Zichen was rather confused why Xia Keke became so clingy all of a sudden.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if they were connected by the marriage string, their affability level was only 10. Such intimate actions were impossible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No wonder.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Playfulness filled Ye Zichen’s eyes, while Xia Keke smiled idiotically while maintaining her pout and looking innocently at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You want me to buy the bag for you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Wan and the clerk from earlier also walked over. Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows and smiled towards Jing Wan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jing Wan the major streamer is also here, you two together?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I invited Keke to come with me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Wan smiled warmly. Even though Ye Zichen had attacked and nearly shattered her dreams at the cold drinks shop, she still didn’t give up on them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Furthermore, she did not give up on the idea of inviting Ye Zichen to her team either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t this great, major streamer Jing Wan is so rich, isn’t it fine to get her to buy it for you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen indicated towards Jing Wan, while Xia Keke bit her lips. She directly let go of his arm and clenched her teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop bullshitting, are you buying it or not?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke resumed her normal personality and directly threatened him. The difference in personality caused Ye Zichen to laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re begging me to buy the bag for you and yet you’re threatening me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Feeling like there seemed to be a chance, Xia Keke giggled and shook Ye Zichen’s arm again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then Zichen-gege, help me buy the bag, okay!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You want the bag?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke nodded like a pecking chick, while desire shone in her eyes. Ye Zichen smiled, then slowly brushed her hand away from his arm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But I’m not buying it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen wasn’t an idiot, he had peeked at the bag’s price.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Twenty something thousand!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What kind of idiot would spend twenty something thousand to buy a purse?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>What he was wearing totaled to less than two thousand yuan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke opened her eyes wide in anger. However, Ye Zichen acted like he wasn’t afraid of anything and shrugged in response.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop shouting, no matter how much you shout, I can’t possibly buy it for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Give it to her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing, who was floating in midair, suddenly ordered Ye Zichen. He looked up speechlessly, and saw Liu Qing smiling like a little devil.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you want to sleep peacefully in the future, then listen to me. I don’t need to sleep.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Crack.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clenched his teeth with a lot of force. He was regretting bringing Liu Qing back with him more and more now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He f*cking brought a master back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing did not speak up again, but Ye Zichen knew that this master was definitely not joking with him from her creepy smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he didn’t buy it, she definitely would do exactly what she said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Clerk, wrap the bag up, I’m going to buy it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn’t defeat this ghost girl, so he could only submit. Ye Zichen got the clerk to wrap the bag up with a clench of her teeth. He thought it through, it was just twenty thousand yuan.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wasn’t it extremely easy for him, who had the Fiery Eyes of Truth, to earn money?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, a voice of disagreement sounded out outside the Chanel store.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen turned around, and a hint of speechlessness flashed across his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The world truly was a small place, he could bump into Guo Qiang and Yao Yue even when coming to the mall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen saw Yao Yue, his gaze had remained on her for a few moments. No matter what, she was a girl that he had dated for a long time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, from the looks of it, she had a pretty good life with Guo Qing. What she was wearing was far superior to what she wore when she was with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yao Yue stopping the clerk just now was purely because she wanted the bag. She had seen it two hours earlier and had got interested in it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she definitely didn’t have the money to buy it, so she had been waiting for Guo Qiang to come over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She couldn’t help but resist calling out when she saw that her bag was about to be bought when she was outside the store.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She never would have thought that the person buying the bag was actually Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can you afford the bag? This bag is twenty something thousand yuan!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yao Yue walked in with her arm around Guo Qiang’s, while displaying a mocking expression. Then, she very quickly displayed a coquettish look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qiang-ge, I want that bag.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rubbed his temples and shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yao Yue, why must you go against me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke and Jing Wan also walked over. Ye Zichen twitched his mouth and said softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My ex, she found a rich dude. She just keeps on going against me for no reason, I don’t understand why.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke pouted as a hint of disdain flashed across her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She didn’t think well of those sorts of women.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Wan’s expression as the same, but she didn’t make it that obvious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Going against you, do you even have the right for that?” Yao Yue’s eyes were full of disdain. Then, she shook Guo Qiang’s arm, “Qiang-ge.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ll buy it. Isn’t it just Chanel. If you want to, I’ll help you buy the entire store,”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Qiang chuckled coyly. Actually, he was kind of pretentious when saying that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was just unhappy why a crap like Ye Zichen would always be surrounded by beauties.</span></p>
 <p><span style>School beauty Su Yan, and now school beauty Xia Keke, and most importantly, there was also the one on the side…</span></p>
 <p><span style>She seemed to be the super idol Jing Wan from a certain streaming site!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why was this poor brat’s luck so good!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, this was merely because he was behind on the times. If he read the school net more, it was unknown whether he would still think that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Clerk, give me a bag of the same kind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Qiang waved his hand, while the clerk gave a light smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir, this is the last one in our store.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qiang-ge…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yao Yue acted coquettishly once again. Seeing that, Guo Qiang licked his lips and laughed coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll pay fifty thousand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was raising the price!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen snickered. Does Guo Qiang really think that he doesn’t have a temper? Even a person made out of mud would have a bit of temper, not to mention him, a living human.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A hundred thousand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shouted out without blinking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A hundred and fifty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style> “Two hundred!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Three hundred!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Five hundred!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Under Ye Zichen and Guo Qiang’s competition, a chanel that was merely twenty something thousand had its price rise exponentially.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke and Jing Wan pulled on Ye Zichen, signaling him not to continue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Liu Qing, who was in the air, also told Ye Zichen to stop.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Stop?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>How was that possible?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A man relied on face, telling him to stop…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A million!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Qiang also decided, he understood very well that it was no longer a matter about the bag, it was a matter about face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“1.5 million.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rose the price without thinking, while the clerk immediately went dumb.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She never would have thought that the situation would escalate to this degree.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The customers in the mall all gradually surrounded the store. A bag was going to sell for more than a million and neither of them seemed to see the other right.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of them wanted to see who the bag ended up with.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Two million!” Guo Qiang clenched his teeth once again, while Ye Zichen picked his ear and laughed softly, “Three million!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, Ye Zichen didn’t have that much money on his card, he merely wanted to con Guo Qiang of more money.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was sure that this grandson, Guo Qiang, would definitely add more on due to face. When that happens, he’ll immediately give up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Qiang would earn face, but he would lose his money.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, who would have thought…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, it’s yours.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Qiang suddenly smiled playfully and gave up on the competition.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen instantly was dumbstruck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What the hell? That doesn’t make any sense!</span></p>
