 <p><span style>Chapter 34 – Solo Offline</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing Xia Keke, who was smiling behind him, Ye Zichen immediately became annoyed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t make her pay for ruining him and Su Yan yet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And now, she had come to him again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes at Xia Keke and sat down on the chair and played with his phone while ignoring her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kang Peng.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Present.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kang Peng, who was 1.9 meters, shocked Xia Keke like a mouse seeing a cat. He directly threw his mouse to the side and nudged Ye Zichen with his elbow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi, why are you speaking to goddess Xia like that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop bothering me, I don’t like the look of you right now either,” Ye Zichen pointed at Kang Peng’s nose. This brat still had the face to come and try to calm him down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>F*ck, he messed up his good chance, if it wasn’t their friendship of two years, he really wanted to punch him into the wall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi, big bro didn’t have a choice,” Kang Peng sneaked a peek at Xia Keke, who had her hands on her waist. “Do you remember that Old Friend, who you wrecked?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, that grandson, what about him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are you calling grandson?” Xia Keke’s hackles instantly flew up. Ye Zichen rolled his eyes at her, “Girl, why did you learn to think that all insults are being thrown at you in the few days that we haven’t met?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, he very quickly noticed Kang Peng’s expression, causing him to open his eyes wide.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Friend is you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re right, the grandson you were talking about is this lady.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But didn’t you say that you are in Master?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Elo Booster, don’t you get it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke was so angry that she could rip Ye Zichen to pieces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she got wrecked the other day, Xia Keke already held a grudge and silently swore that if she found him in the future, she must solo him offline.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Coincidentally, electricity at the school stopped the previous night.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since she still had many jobs she didn’t finish, she decided to do them at the network café, then coincidentally saw the ID that she hated the most.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke got impulsive and immediately grabbed Kang Peng by the ear, forcing him to solo offline.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She destroyed him for five games in a row.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then she found out that Ye Zichen was actually playing for him that day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s why she told Kang Peng to call Ye Zichen back, in order to wash away her shame.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Elo Booster?” Ye Zichen had an expression of disbelief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke wasn’t someone that needed money, why would she elo boost?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>To earn money by herself?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is there something wrong with her!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen wasn’t a rich second-generation, if he were one, then he would enjoy the rich life more than anyone else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t look at this lady like that, this lady just like to play this game. Why wouldn’t I do it if I can play the game and earn money at the same time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Keke’s reply caused Ye Zichen to roll his eyes. Then he saw the two empty seats beside him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seems like Xia Keke was determined to solo him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You sure you want to play against me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then wait a bit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen went to scan his ID card at the counter, then returned to turn on the computer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Login.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Welcome Gold Three to Computer No. 160 of our network café.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Welcome Master to Computer No. 159 of our network café.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Master!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, everyone in the bar all stood up and walked over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Girl! It’s a pretty girl.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damn, isn’t this the school beauty, Xia Keke, of Polytechnic University?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Goddess is actually in Master!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My god, on Ionia!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The crowd all exclaimed, while Ye Zichen twitched his mouth helplessly at Xia Keke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is a crazy group of guys behind you, how about I leave some face for you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, if we’re going to solo, then do it properly, no need to go easy on me! What’s more, it isn’t certain who would win!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen received her friend request.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Accept.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, he received a game invitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Solo offline.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This bro is also Master?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, I heard that he was Gold something. I forgot.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen and Xia Keke both ignored the crowd behind them.</span></p>
 <p><span style> “Best of 5, first blood, first turret or a hundred CS.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen showed an ‘ok’ hand gesture.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The game begun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both of them used Zed for the first round.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was Ye Zichen’s first time playing Zed. There could be no helping it, he had only played support before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before the game started, he looked up a guide on Baidu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damn, is this brat okay, reading a guide?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He peeked over at Xia Keke. This girl was truly a LoL fanatic, she completely forgot about everything else when she’s playing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen truly admired this level of focus.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>But what use is that?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>First blood.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ugh.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style> “What happened, goddess lost?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It can’t be, a Master got raped by a Gold?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Could our goddess had been… carried?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Next game?” Ye Zichen wandered around on Xia Keke’s corpse in game. He saw that her face was green as she stared at the screen.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>How did she die?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>She didn’t miscalculate the damage!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style> “Next!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both of them chose LeBlanc.</span></p>
 <p><span style>First blood!</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The entire crowd was confused, Ye Zichen once again used his champion to wander around the corpse of Xia Keke’s champion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Next?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Next!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>For the third match, both of them chose Lee Sin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen knew clearly that if he played properly, Xia Keke would still lose without a doubt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t because she wasn’t truly at the level of Master, it’s just that Ye Zichen was too good.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Don’t talk about Master, even if a Challenger with 1000 LP came…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He would still destroy him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen glanced over at Xia Keke and saw that the little loli’s face had already lost her initial calm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She pursed her lips tightly, while she was also completely tense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if Ye Zichen casually threw out a Q, Xia Keke would click furiously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen lifted the corner of his mouth. He still chose to go straight on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>First blood!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, Xia Keke won.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aiya, aiya, accident. My hand, my hand!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen hit the back of his hand, while pretending to be annoyed. When the crowd saw this, they finally let out a sigh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s more like it. How could a Gold beat Master.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke’s pursed lips also lifted slightly. She did like Ye Zichen did the previous two games and wandered around the corpse of his character with hers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Next?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She even used the same words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Next!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled as well when he saw Xia Keke get energetic again.</span></p>
 <p><span style> Ye Zichen lost again not long later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Ye Zichen still lost on the fifth game.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Best of five.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke won.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Amazing, Keke, you are pretty good. Alright, you won the offline solo!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen leaned backwards and stretched lazily before quitting LoL.</span></p>
 <p><span style> “I’m so tired, going to go back and sleep.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen walked out, while he stretched his neck. Meanwhile, Xia Keke bit her lips, then chased after him after a brief hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the two of them left, a girl, wearing a cap, looking at Ye Zichen and Xia Keke’s figures thoughtfully.</span></p>
