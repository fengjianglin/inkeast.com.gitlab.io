 <p><span style>Chapter 573 – Enemies Only Get Angrier When They Meet</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen and Gou Yuzhan wandered around Mount Supreme a bit more using their free time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They managed to use the map to determine that they had already walked through a tenth of Mount Supreme. It was very fortunate that the map had indicated all the dangerous locations on the map as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for how they managed to confirm it…</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was because Gou Yuzhan didn’t believe it at first, and insisted on going over to see it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, he was already scared speechless before taking a few steps in. Ye Zichen had tried to question Gou Yuzhan about what was inside, but the latter merely shook his head in a dazed manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Ye Zichen was curious about what was there, he chose not to go for safety’s sake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If the skulls represents danger, then doesn’t the treasure chest mean treasure? The old guy did say that there are normal divine artifacts to be found in the surroundings…” Ye Zichen held the map and frowned. The position they were on was where the map showed a treasure chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were steep walls on either side, and only a meandering path forward which seemed endless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tsss…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Seriously, you sickly bastard, why did you stick yourself onto me?” An unwilling voice complained sounded out from a nearby place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen turned around, and saw Bian Tianrui walk over along the path with Mu Chengtian.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The world is truly tiny. I actually managed to bump into them here.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, do you think I want to? What’s more, you lack any potential to become a subordinate. You didn’t even help me up when I fell down just now,” Ye Zichen could tell that it was Mu Chengtian speaking from the tone, after all, only that sickly bastard spoke like that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m helping you here. God knows who spoiled you like this. A man like you lived in such a weak manner like a woman. Even a sneeze could make you fall over. You need to fall over and beaten up more, otherwise, you’ll die sooner or later,” Bian Tianrui scolded angrily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bullshit, everyone will die in the end. Your words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to…” Bian Tianrui raised his hand to hit Mu Chengtian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, Mu Chengtian stuck his face over shamelessly, “Hit me, beat me to death. You’ll get killed without a teammate. Killed, you get it? Kill me if you dare. I might actually be able to bump into you in the Underworld when I go and drink Meng Po’s soup.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…” Bian Tianrui’s expression darkened when he thought of getting killed, then put his hand down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason he could even endure Mu Chengtian along the way was due to the game’s rules. If it wasn’t because of that, then he would have smacked Mu Chengtian to death already.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Seriously, why the hell did I choose someone like this as an ally?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Infighting now are you? Haha, why didn’t you do it? I want first hand evidence of your crimes,” Ye Zichen held his phone and turned on the flashlight, causing Bian Tianrui and Mu Chengtian to be momentarily blinded. They only noticed who was there when they used their hands to cover the light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing Ye Zichen, the sickly person beside Bian Tianrui stopped arguing with him, and glared at Ye Zichen with snake-like eyes, “It’s you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Achoo!” At that very moment, Gou Yuzhan rubbed his nose and muttered. “Who was thinking about me? Oh I know, it must be the lollipops!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Gou Yuzhan muttered to himself, Mu Chengtian, who was about to curse… “Ahhh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chengtian wobbled, then reached out to grab Bian Tianrui to support himself. Yet, Bian Tianrui was sick of him already, Bian Tianrui just directly pushed Mu Chengtian onto the floor, then walked over to Ye Zichen with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Seriously, only enemies meet. We’ve walked around for nearly a day. I never expected for the people we bump into to be you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, it really is fate!” Ye Zichen smiled, then summoned out Xuan-Yuan Sword from his arm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You want to fight?” Bian Tianrui smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why not? It’s two on one. It looks like I have the edge here,” Ye Zichen also chuckled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Gou Yuzhan immediately knew that the two of them were on terrible terms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoosh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He summoned out a staff and walked beside Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, how should we hit him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hit him hard!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen charged forward with Xuan-Yuan Sword, while Gou Yuzhan leaped into the air to make the first attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Phew.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An person identical to Bian Tianrui appeared from him. Gou Yuzhan’s smash landed on the avatar, causing it to turn into a wisp of smoke, only to stick together again not long later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems like you were hiding something. I thought Keke ate all of your avatars.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bian Tianrui trembled in anger. Profound Energy was a rare treasure in the God Realm. Although his father had a bit of a status in the God Realm, it wasn’t easy for him to get all the Profound Energy that he had obtained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, the girl he met actually ate seventy percent of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, if you have time to bullshit, might as well show me what you’ve got,” Bian Tianrui laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye ZIchen shrugged, and pointed behind him, “Bro, it’s two on one. Didn’t you notice someone missing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Take this!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gou Yuzhan smashed his staff onto the back of Bian Tianrui’s head, causing blood to flow down from his forehead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Avatar!” Bian Tianrui covered his head and roared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The profound energy avatar immediately charged towards Gou Yuzhan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment, Gou Yuzhan licked his lips, then put away his staff…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Engulf the world!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A huge suction force was generated in his mouth, causing the profound energy avatar to disappear in it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, the pitiful Mu Chengtian…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just crawled back up from the ground, then wobbled, and flew over to Gou Yuzhan due to the suction force.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What the hell, I don’t eat people,” Gou Yuzhan frowned, then grabbed Mu Chengtian by his leg and yanked him onto the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chengtian fainted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, that messy hair dude over there. Do you have any more of that avatar? It was quite delicious,” Gou Yuzhan licked his lips happily and put on an expression of enjoyment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bian Tianrui was furious, his Profound Energy Avatar…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rummmmble.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ground shook.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everything happened in the blink of an eye. Ye Zichen’s pupils contracted when he saw rocks continuously fall onto the ground from the steep cliffs beside them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Run,” just when Ye Zichen called out, Gou Yuzhan had already begun to run.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bian Tianrui was also troubled. In that situation, he no longer had the time to think about grudges. All he wanted to do was to survive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh my god!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chengtian, who had just fainted, also opened his eyes. When he saw the falling rocks, he immediately jumped up without anybody’s help and begun to run out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was the last one, but somehow ended up in the very front.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, at the same time, the moment he got out of the danger zone, he smiled coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He grabbed a rock that weighed nearly a ton, then threw it out with his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Trying to compete with me? Heh, you’re funny!”</span></p>

 <p><b>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</b>Do you remember anything else about him?</p>
 <p><strong>Gou Yuzhan:&nbsp;</strong>No?</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Seriously. Nothing else?</p>
 <p><strong>Gou Yuzhan:&nbsp;</strong>Of course not! My mind was on the food I would get after getting here! But who would have expected you to...</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>That wasn't...</p>
 <p><strong>Gou Yuzhan:&nbsp;</strong>Don't try and deny it, that was so you!</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>No, you said it yourself. He looked older and seemed like he been through a lot more.</p>
 <p><strong>Gou Yuzhan:&nbsp;</strong>I don't care, he's still you.</p>
