 <p><span style>Chapter 364 – I Will Protect This Land</span></p>
 <p><span style>An intense feeling spread out within the hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Hai and co. subconsciously made way in the middle of the hall in order for the great deity to fight to his best potential.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the demon smiled playfully, “This sovereign’s main body is in closed cultivation right now. This sovereign has noted your challenge.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, the remaining black mist flew out of the hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian snorted and cursed in disdain, “Grandson. Closed cultivation? If you really dared to fight, then laozi will beat you up until you’re an infant!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that the fight wasn’t going to happen, everyone returned to Yang Jian’s side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Gu Hai looked at the shattered statue on the ground, he couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows,” Great deity, this statue…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Reconstruct one when you find time,” Yang Jian glanced at his statue. It was the first time he actually smashed his own statue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do we have to go to the other families?” Zhuge Hong asked. “That demon seems to have said that he has been to all the families in the Modern Realm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, laozi doesn’t trust what the demon said!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Three days passed by in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian did not lay idle during these days. He followed Zhuge Hong around to all the different families, and directly smashed the statues they used for worship without identifying himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During so, he saw several families that worships the monkey, and thus he smashed those statues to dust.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In his words, it was because “Since I can’t beat the monkey now, I feel good after letting off steam using his statue”.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At a certain high-class graveyard in the capital, there was a gravestone that costed as much as the most expensive apartment in the city.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the autumn rain fell, Gu Tian held a bouquet of white flowers and a black umbrella as he stood in front of Hua Li’s gaze. His face carried hints of solemnity as he looked at the kind smile on the black and white photo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even at the very end, Elder Hua did not betray me,” Gu Tian smiled. “During the day of the junior family head election, the only person that didn’t vote for Gu Li was Elder Hua, who voted for me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen patted his shoulders and comforted him, “The dead have already passed on, there is no need to mind so much now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But I’m discontent with everything,” Gu Tian clenched his fist tightly, while a furious expression covered his face. “If it wasn’t for Gu Li… I was truly blind, I actually trusted his damn words!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will not let that brat go,” Ye Zichen’s gaze gradually turned cold. Then, he smiled helplessly. “Of course, it doesn’t seem like he will let me go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen-ge, sorry!” Gu Tian suddenly put down his umbrella and allowed the rain to drench his clothing, as he gave Ye Zichen a deep bow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you doing!” Ye Zichen quickly handed his own umbrella over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Tian smiled wryly, “If it wasn’t for me, you wouldn’t have gotten wrapped up in all this!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It seems like he feels like he is at fault for the grudge Gu Li has against me.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shook his head with a smile and patted his shoulder, “Don’t be dumb, kid. Even if it wasn’t for you, some trouble will still come and find me. After all, that’s what my fate is like!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen understood clearly in his heart that he most likely got involved with the demons was because he was the reincarnation of the Yellow Emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It might even be that the demons are a fated tribulation in his life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he did not know how many tribulations he has to pass through to live a peaceful life, nor did he know how many tribulations he had already passed through.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All he knew was that…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Trouble never stopped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are now the Gu family’s family head. You have to manage the Gu family well, and make it flourish. That’s what you should be thinking about.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Actually… Zichen-ge, you are the actual family head of the Gu family,” Gu Tian looked up with a wryly smile. “Grandpa told me that he had promised Auntie before that her child would be the future Gu family head!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t!” Ye Zichen raised his hand frantically. “Don’t bring this up. I’ll live a calm normal person’s life, and leave the Gu family in your hands. What’s more, isn’t it the same which of us is in charge?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm, Big Brother!” Gu Tian nodded with force.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, a ray of light fell down from the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that light, Ye Zichen knew that Yang Jian had arrived, since he always created all these pointless special effects for his entrance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Ye Zichen expected, Yang Jian, who was topless, walked over. Even though he didn’t carry an umbrella, the rain silently disappeared from his body after landing on it, and his body did not get wet from the rain at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re about to go back?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In recent days, Yang Jian had been focused on dealing with the statue situation in the Modern Realm, and now, he had to report all that happened to Taibai Jinxing, who was in the Heavenly Court very quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had initially wanted to get him to try the WiFi, but it didn’t work for him…</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was slightly strange, since White Impermanence was able to receive messages from the Underworld even when she was in the Modern Realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have to return, the demon realm actually reached their claws out to this abandoned place. This was once the land of the Heavenly Court, so I have to report this in!” Yang Jian frowned, then patted Ye Zichen’s shoulders. “Bro, how about returning to the Heavenly Court with me? This place isn’t safe. Your strength doesn’t seem too strong either, so you should be reincarnating, right? It was fine for you here before, but now…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The care caused Ye Zichen to feel a bit of warmth in his heart, but he still shook his head with a smile, “Never mind, I’ve stayed here for so long that I don’t want to leave. Go back to the Heavenly Court and report it in without worry. During so, I shall protect this land!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian’s expression was moved as if he felt the Ye Zichen’s determination.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked at Ye Zichen for a long while, then nodded with a smile, “Alright, then I’ll leave this land to you, bro. Erm, a friendly reminder first, it isn’t the time of descendance between Chang’e and I, so she might still descend in a while!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What!?” Ye Zichen had wanted to show off a bit using the heroic aura he put on moments ago, but that was instantly rendered futile when Chang’e was brought up. “She’ll still descend? Didn’t you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I made it so that she can’t descend, but I’ll be returning. If I return, then what I set up wouldn’t work!” Yang Jian scratched his head with a coil smile, then looked up into the sky. “I’ll talk to you when I get back to the Heavenly Court. I’ll be off!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian immediately disappeared from the world without saying anything else. Ye Zichen scratched his head and let out a long sigh as he looked at the place where Yang Jian left from.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Gu Tian spoke up, “Chang’e… Big Brother Ye, you can really talk to people in the Heavenly Court?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm!” Ye Zichen nodded, while his phone rang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen said a few simple words to the person on the other side of the call.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, reluctance surfaced on Gu Tian’s face, “You’re leaving?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s time to return!” Ye Zichen stretched lazily with a smile. “I’ve been in the capital for too long. There’re still a bunch of stuff waiting for me to deal with over there!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, then I won’t make you stay. Big Brother Ye, take care!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded with a smile, then looked up at the darkening sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s time to go back! Demon race… Come to Bingcheng if you want me!”</span></p>
