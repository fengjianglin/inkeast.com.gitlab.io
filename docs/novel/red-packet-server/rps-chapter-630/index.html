 <p><span style>Chapter 630 – Apology</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Ye, here’re your divine stones.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Liang carefully handed the handed the seven seemingly normal stones to Ye Zichen as if he was handling some rare treasure in the courtyard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, they really weren’t lost,” Ye Zichen put the divine stones away into his Treasure Chest with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, even if a primordial divine weapon is thrown around carelessly in the Zuo household, it won’t be lost. Even if you come half a month later after putting it somewhere, it’ll still be there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Amazing,” Ye Zichen shook his head with a smile, but didn’t take Zuo Liang seriously. “Where’s your sis?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My father called her away,” Zuo Liang said helplessly. “We beat up that Mu family guy just now. Although my father spoils her, he has to understand the situation. Don’t worry, she’ll be fine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s was speechless. </span><i><span style>Of course Zuo Mo will be fine, I was the one who did the beating. Even if the Mu family people come over, they won’t possibly do anything for her due to the Treasure Tower.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But they will to me!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment, Zuo Mo walked into the courtyard alongside a man wearing a silk robe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man was of mediocre size. He had a small moustache underneath his chin, while his eyes were extremely sharp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Mo had her arms around his. She wore a long dress and seemed to have put on a bit of makeup on her already pretty face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her eyes were watery, but her expression was rather dark as she had a clear pout on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Father,” Zuo Liang greeted the man with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen hesitated for a moment. He never expected that the seemingly young man in front of him was actually the master of the Treasure Tower, Zuo Hongde.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Liang,” Zuo Hongde nodded, then rested his gaze on Ye Zichen with a smile. “Little friend Ye, we meet again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was confused.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Have we met before?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Little friend Ye, no need to overthink this. You have never seen me before, but I did manage to catch a glance of you when I went to pick Lil’ Mo up previously at Maple City. Little friend Ye was merely of the Human Immortal level back then, but I could already tell that you were no commoner. Now I see that you have reached the Sky Immortal level. I heard that you were able to defeat Zheng Qian without much force. Young people are truly fearsome!” Zuo Hongde smiled warmly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen quickly returned a smile, “Tower Head Zuo is exaggerating.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But I have to remind Little Friend Ye,” Zuo Hongde smiled. “No matter what happens, the Mu family is one of the peak forces in the outer area of the Immortal Region, what they have is beyond your imagination. Even the Treasure Tower cannot say that we are completely stronger than them. Little friend Ye, do you understand what I mean? What’s more, it isn’t easy for thee Treasure Tower to survive. I admire you, but that doesn’t mean I have confidence in you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Father,” Zuo Mo shook his arm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Hongde looked back with a sharp gaze, “Zuo Mo, father might have spoiled you too much before. These times are not like the past. Perhaps father supported you in breaking off the engagement and was happy for your strength. But it’s not like you don’t know what has happened recently!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Mo lowered her head and bit her lips. Ye Zichen frowned…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>There seemed to be more to this?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry, you’ve seen something unsightly,” Zuo Hongde looked up with a smile. “But I have an unreasonable request, I wonder if you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Father, I forced Ye Zichen to beat up Zheng Qian, it has nothing to do with him,” Zuo Mo let go of her hands and blocked her father’s way towards Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Mo, that’s enough,” Zuo Hongde frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen curled his lips, grabbed Zuo Mo’s shoulder and shook his head, then looked up at Zuo Hongde with a shrug. “You want to bring me over to apologize?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little friend Yew, please understand, I have no choice. I will however ensure your safety.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Hongde’s expression didn’t even show a single bit of apologetic look or display even a hint of an attitude befitting of someone who was making a request, even though he was asking Ye Zichen. The truth was simple. He didn’t take Ye Zichen seriously at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Father!” Zuo Mo frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Hongde squinted his eyes and snorted. “Shut up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Mo was shocked. Zuo Hongde had never once shouted at her like that. She looked at the man in front of her in shock for a long time. She could not understand why, in just a mere few days…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why did my father change so much? He wasn’t like this a week ago.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Mo bit her lips and ran off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did a hint of reluctance appeared in Zuo Hongde’s expression. However, he kept a stern face and ordered, “Bring the young lady back here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoosh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen felt the space around him twist, then saw two faint figures chase after where Zuo Mo ran towards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He felt a chill down his spine.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Two experts were hiding near me just now!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Little friend Ye, what do you say?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course I can go,” Ye Zichen pursed his lips. “But can you tell me why you’re so scared of the Mu family? No matter what, both the Mu family and Zuo family are peak forces amongst those in the outer area of the Immortal Region.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Hongde sighed dejectedly, then shook his head with a smile. “That’s none of your business. All you have to do is come and apologize with me. I can assure you that I will definitely ensure your safety. If you have to take some physical pain… Then please endure it. I will obviously compensate you afterwards.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen frowned, but he still nodded with a smile. “Alright, then I’ll go with you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen and co. all sat within a single carriage. To nobody’s surprise, Zuo Mo was captured, and was forced to sit in the carriage unwillingly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Hongde tried to talk to her several times, but Zuo Mo merely ignored him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was clear that Zuo Hongde had dedicated a lot to this. There were spiritual items and spiritual artifacts worth several hundred million celeste in the cart behind them, which were all for the sake of apologizing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zuo Mo, I don’t care how much of a grudge you have against father. But when we reach the Mu household, you better watch yourself,” Zuo Hongde said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Mo looked up with teary eyes, “Why? Why are you so scared of the Mu family? You clearly didn’t think much of the Mu family before, you also said that the Mu family has no future. Why did you change so much in just a few days?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course I have my reasons!” Zuo Hongde frowned. “Do you think I want to submit to that old Mu monster? But I said it, the times have changed. I have to do this for the sake of the Zuo family!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But you have to tell me why!” Zuo Mo sobbed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Hongde let out a soft sigh. “Then I’ll tell you the truth. Mu Chengtian was chosen. Yesterday, the Six Realms Patroller visited the Mu family and chose Mu Chengtian. Lil’ Mo, you should know what this means right? Father really doesn’t have a choice.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Mo’s body trembled. Although she didn’t want to accept it, she could only remain silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She understood very well just what it meant to be chosen by the Six Realms Patroller.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was an incomparable honor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An incomparable status!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Ye Zichen’s pupils contracted.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Six Realms…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Six Realms Patroller!</span></i></p>
