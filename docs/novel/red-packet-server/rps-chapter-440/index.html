 <p><span style>Chapter 440 – Familiar Feeling</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing leaving the Heavenly Court caused the numbers of members in the Red Packet Server to shoot up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the number of members had already broken past a hundred people, ad it contained great deities in the Heavenly Court, as well as heavenly soldiers and heavenly generals who defend the Heavenly Court…</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, they only had one purpose in joining the group – To seek the truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: Great deity appeared! But why is he asking for red packets from the get-go? &lt;insert a row of speechless emojis&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>This girl was one of the gossipiest ones, so she would be anywhere with gossip.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Send what red packets? Doesn’t Sky Sovereign know how poor I am!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mother of Lightning: ^</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: See? This old man told you guys that you have to send red packets after entering the group already, but you didn’t believe me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Yeah, send red packets!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang: Send red packets!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: Wow, Big Brother Pig, Big Brother Yang Jian, Gramps Old Lord, long time no see.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: Hehe, I, Old Sun, is here as well!</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Wow, everyone’s here again. Alright, I’m just going to stay here for now on, since the Heavenly Court group’s like a dead sea.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mother of Lightning: ^</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was rather moved when he saw this. When he had entered the Heavenly Court’s chat group, these were the most active ones.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, due to various events, they had split up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He never would have imagined these people to gather once again in a group that he made.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shook his head with a smile. </span><i><span style>Back then, I was a true lurker, and always waited for red packets sneakily in the group.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>So much time has passed in the split of an eye.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop exclaiming here, since we’re all together again, then shouldn’t we display our amazingness from back then? Just send a round of red packets… The name of the group is Red Packet Server, do you think that’s the name for nothing!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen chuckled, then sent a message in the group, causing the deities in the group to start crying about how poor they were once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: Sky Sovereign’s a baddie, you get Yue Lao to earn our cultivation experience every day, and now you’re making us send red packets. &lt;insert a crying emoji&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: I’m just a pure person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: You’re just a stingy person, and is stingy beyond believe. Even though I was in the Heavenly Court’s group for so long, I’ve never seen you give out a single red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Yeah.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: ^</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Wow, you guys… When did you start agreeing with each other?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang: You will never understand our revolutionary friendship. Lil’ Thunder, you’re still too young.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mother of Lightning: Did Old Lord and all the great deities gone over to the same side!?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: Ahem…</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Fortune: You guys aren’t sending any red packets, so I’ll set an example.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, God of Fortune sent a red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Ye Zichen did not snatch a red packet for long time, he reacted slightly slower…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Due to that, all of the red packets were already gone.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Not bad, it kind of feels like when I just entered that chat group. </span></i><span style>Ye Zichen took a look at everyone else’s look, and to no surprise, Yang Jian had the worst luck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: @Erlang Shen, my son, is one gold ingot enough for food?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Monkey, don’t think that this is still the same Yang Jian from before. Laozi doesn’t lack this tiny bit of gold ingots now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang: Zezeze, ever since the game Landlord came around, Yang Jian’s so much more confident. But don’t you know where you earned your money from?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Why complain to me when you’re an old fool. &lt;insert a disdain emoji&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: Then are you saying I’m an old fool as well?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: I didn’t say that, but we understand in our hearts &lt;insert an eyeroll emoji&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as if Yang Jian was born with a taunt magnet that his words even made Ye Zichen want to hit him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Other deities in the group all yammered and told them to start a flame war as if they weren’t worried about causing trouble.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Out of them, Immortality Peach Fairy said it the most frequently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing: What are you guys all blabbering for!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Taibai Jinxing appeared, all of the deities in the group no longer called about Yang Jian and co.’s argument…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: @Taibai Jinxing, great deity, this little journalist wants to interview you. Why did you leave the Heavenly Court? Is it because there are hidden news in the Heavenly Court that we do not know of?</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Yeah. Additional question: Why did you even return your celestial position?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mother of Lightning: That’s a great question. Another question: Rumors have it that you had a special relationship with the Jade Emperor, is that true?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: What kind of disgusting questions are these?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: I, Old Sun, doesn’t get it. Idiot, explain them to I, Old Sun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: They just want to ask whether Geezer Taibai is the Jade Emperor’s lover!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: Yang Jian, you’re screwed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang: Yang Jian, you’re screwed!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Huh?</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Yang Jian was completely confused, Ye Zichen, who was in the same room as Taibai Jinxing, felt a sinister aura radiate out from opposite him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked up, and saw that Taibai Jinxing’s face had already turned a purple.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehehe…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old man, calm down. Yang Jian said that, so don’t go insane here! This apartment is quite expensive, if you break it, you can’t afford to compensate me!” Ye Zichen gulped as he quickly spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Taibai Jinxing did not seem to hear him, as the sinister aura around Taibai Jinxing became denser.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing: @Erlang Shen, this old man’s phone had an issue just now. Can you explain it to me one more time?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: What kind of shitty phone do you have? Do you need me to buy you one? Just now, I said that the question they wanted to ask is that whether you’re the Jade Emperor’s lover!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: …</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang: …</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: …</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: …</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Should I call him straightforward, or should I call him idiotic? He actually said it again!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehehe…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing’s clenched his teeth so hard that they were about to shatter. Ye Zichen did not even doubt for a second that if Yang Jian was in front of them, he would have been ripped apart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing: Yang Jian, you grew up!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Ha, it’s all thanks to your good teachings &lt;insert a shy emoji and a head scratching emoji&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: Why do I feel something unusual here? Ahem, this little journalist will take her leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: ^</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mother of Lightning: ^^</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing: Good teachings, truly good teachings! Let’s gather when we have time, I’ll definitely give you a great lesson.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King Li: Wow, did I, Old Li, miss something?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha: Hello, Grampa Taibai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing: Good boy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King Li: Taibai, I, Old Li, just doesn’t understand. Why did you leave the Heavenly Court? I, Old Li, knows that you want to eradicate demons, so just directly tell me. @Erlang Shen. With Yang Jian, and my family’s Nezha, would the military force of the three of us be unable to help you?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows when he saw the message. </span><i><span style>I actually forgot…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Although Yang Jian’s unruly, and Third Prince Nezha’s a moe shota, the two of them are true generals in the Heavenly Court. Both of them have huge armies.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Geezer Li, don’t speak like that. I’m already on Taibai’s side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King Li: Oh? You will send out your army to help Taibai?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Mhmm, my bro said he’s going to help this geezer, so I naturally will do as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: I, Old Sun, will help as well. Recently, I’ve been teaching those monkeys on Mount Huaguo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: So, Geezer Li, you’ve got to make the decision now. What do you think?</span></p>
