 <p><span style>Chapter 325 – Lu Lu, who has come to the Capital</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Zhi Xin was completely speechless. </span><i><span style>I really am in happy and yet in pain after meeting a riche guy with so much temper.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen felt extremely good when he saw how speechless the author was. Thus, all of his feelings of anger and annoyance, including those he got from that retarded and shameless woman from the morning, disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You give up now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Divine Riche Person, please stop.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhi Xin frowned. </span><i><span style>If I knew this would happen, I wouldn’t have said a thousand monthly tickets per chapter. That’s great now, now I owe them several hundred chapters…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll let you off after seeing your sincerity!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled, then decided to close the app. However, right before doing so, he couldn’t help but tease the author.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m telling you, don’t kick me. If you kick me, then it wouldn’t just be two hundred thousand tickets.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Ye Zichen chuckled and closed the app, while Zhi Xin laughed wryly. After finishing his read on the latest chapter of the novel, he saw that the sky outside was already dark, so he decided to go to sleep.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Zhi Xin, the author of “Red Packet Server, also continued to type away in the dark of night.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the next day, Ye Zichen was woken up by his ringtone. He took out his phone to look at the caller ID, before completely waking up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Ye.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person who called him was Gu Tian. He, or rather, the Gu family, was the reason Ye Zichen had come to the capital.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had always been curious about the Gu family.</span></p>
 <p><span style>More importantly, it appeared that he had some sort of connection with it. </span><i><span style>In order to find out the truth, I have to go and take a look at the Gu family.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You finally thought of me. I thought you already forgot about me,” Ye Zichen laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Tian stuttered for a moment, then chuckled, “I’m really sorry. The situation in the family has been a bit complex these few days. Even though I know it is a shithole, I have to force myself to jump in since I’m part of the family.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So your family is in a complete mess now?” Ye Zichen smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other end of the phone, Gu Tian nodded, “More or less. Those guys are pretty much doing everything they can for the position of the junior family head!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And you didn’t use some tricks? Don’t tell me that you don’t have any intention of competing. If that’s the case, then I had no reason to come!” Ye Zichen said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I naturally have to fight for it. If I don’t, then with their personalities, they might be the complete end for me. I am purely doing this in self-defense. To be honest, I really don’t have too much desire for the position of the junior family head. But, since you’re here, even if I don’t fight for it, those old guys will push me along,” Gu Tian replied. He took a glance at the elders, who were in discussion in the room, and shook his head with a smile. “Where are you? I’ll go over and get you to let you get a feel for this huge shithole!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I have to buy a gasmask!” Ye Zichen chuckled. “I’m at the inn near the airport. Come, call me when you’re near.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, he hung up the call. After Ye Zichen cleaned himself up simply, he called down to the reception and asked for room service before he leisurely watched television on the sofa.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Approximately ten-odd minutes later…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong dong dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen chucked the remote to the side. </span><i><span style>If there is no surprise, it should be room service. </span></i><span style>He stood up and walked to the door, and opened it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A staff wearing a rabbit mask pushed the trolley in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why aren’t you leaving?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the staff pushed the trolley in, she continuously stared at him. Ye Zichen was able to tell that she was most likely a woman from the area around her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe… Why do I have to leave? I finally got here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the staff took off her mask…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lu Lu!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen put down his raised hand in shock. Due to the giggle, he had thought that it was Qi Cheng, and thus nearly hit her before calling the police.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe!” Lu Lu closed the room door with a giggle, then glanced at the hand Ye Zichen just lowered. “What are you doing? Were you going to hit me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was completely speechless.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>There’s no way I would dare!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The scene of her freezing the snakeman into an ice sculpture was still fresh in his mind, and just thinking about that made Ye Zichen shudder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did you come here? No, wait, how did you find me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sat down on the sofa and changed the topic. Lu Lu followed him with her hands behind her, causing her to show a cute demeanor that made people want to spoil her, “I missed you, so I came to find you. Don’t forget, I can smell you with my nose.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I nearly forgot about that. But seriously, Lu Lu’s nose is seriously amazing. It was whatever that she could smell me in Bingcheng, since we were still relatively close…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But the fact that she can smell me all the way in the capital… Should I say that her nose is too amazing, or that I smell too much?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, you’re amazing,” Ye Zichen shrugged helplessly. “Oh yeah, where did you go a while ago? I didn’t see you in school.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, I’m not telling you. What? You missed me?” Lu Lu put both of her hands on Ye Zichen’s thigh, while craftiness twinkled in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha… Read my lips.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Lu instantly pouted after Ye Zichen mouthed “screw off”, “You aren’t cute at all. If it was the Zhang Junbao from before, he would definitely fall over as he laughed happily. I actually came so far to find you, and you’re actually telling me to screw off… I’m unhappy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Lu wrinkled her face as if she was about to cry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the door to the room was knocked on again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who is it?” Lu Lu frowned, then gazed over Ye Zichen in a judgmental manner. “It can’t be your little lover in the capital, right? Or perhaps, it’s a hotel’s call girl… Zezeze…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Lu squinted her eyes, then quickly ran over to the door and opened it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, c’mon, let your brother take you out…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person who stood at the entrance was Fatty Yin, the one whose face was covered in fat, and the same one that stuck to Ye Zichen like glue. He was smiling so much that his entire face was wrinkled, but when he noticed that the person who opened the door was actually a cute beauty…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uhm… I’m in the wrong room. Sorry, sorry!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty Yin looked at the room number with a coy smile, then was stunned.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I didn’t make a mistake!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He stuck his head into the room to look around once again. When he saw Ye Zichen, who was sitting on the sofa speechlessly, his face was covered in a smile once again as he ran over to Ye Zichen’s side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, wow! You even hid a beauty in the capital!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty Yin’s face was filled with a smile, but at that very moment, the temperature in the room dropped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A heart-chilling cold filled Lu Lu’s face, while a torrent of snow and ice appeared in her palm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are you!? Why did you take over someone else’s body in order to get close to Ye Zichen!” </span></p>
