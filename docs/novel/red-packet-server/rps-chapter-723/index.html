 <p><span style>Chapter 723 – The Demon Realm’s Change</span></p>
 <p><span style>Defeat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Retreat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had confidently set out to conquer the Three Realms before, but ended up retreating frantically and losing many of their own.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the demon army finally exited the wormhole, both the demon leaders and the normal soldiers were extremely downhearted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter what they felt, they had to admit it the moment they stepped out of the wormhole.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>We lost.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Why is it so quiet?” The Demon Sovereigns all frowned as they walked out. Although they sent most of their troops out for conquest, they still left some soldiers behind to pretend to others from attacking their base.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>After an entire hour of looking around, they still did not notice any of their patrollers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They are actually lazing off when we’re gone!? We definitely have to teach them a lesson!” One of the Demon Sovereigns grumbled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The truth was that he said it to protect the guards. It wouldn’t be the first time for Black Dragon to kill them all in a fit of rage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon had been in a violent mood ever since they departed from the Three Realms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had already lost too many of their kin, they did not want to lose anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Something’s not right!” Li Min’e signaled the army to stop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone looked at her in disbelief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her nose twitched as she frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it?” Black Dragon asked. Li Min’e’s sense of smell was the most sensitive among all the Demon Sovereigns.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Although the smell of blood is very faint, it’s still around.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Blood…” The other Demon Sovereigns inhaled deeply. However, they did not discover anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Min’e, could it just be that you have not yet recovered from what happened in the Three Realms?” Hua Kui snickered. </span><i><span style>All of us are sensitive to the smell of blood, but none of us smelled anything.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s more, we saw no dead bodies nor spiritual energy fluctuations that would indicate a fight.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Li Min’e shook her head resolutely. She had absolute confidence in her sense of smell. “The smell of blood is definitely here, but a long time has already passed. I would say at least six months worth of time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hah!” Another Demon Sovereign snickered. His flames of rage of the defeat was still burning and now Li Min’e’s vigilance only irritated him. “Six months? You want to tell me that someone took over this place when we left? Then shouldn’t we hurry up and cower away instead of stand here!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm?” Black Dragon’s expression dropped.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Defeat.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Cower away.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon felt like all of it was directly at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Demon Sovereign immediately explained himself. “My Lord, I am not talking about you. Li Min’e is truly being too sensitive. The defenses of our realm are as tough as a rock, how could anyone have taken over right after we left? What’s more, Old Six was left here as well. Even if someone did come, he should have sent a message even if he wasn’t a match for the enemy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Six was referring to one of the Demon Sovereigns and it was also their ranking of strength amongst them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This sixth ranking Demon Sovereign was the one Black Dragon had left behind just in case anything happens. He was also at the level of a complete stage Sky Immortal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh,” Black Dragon snorted. If it wasn’t because of the demons already suffering so many losses, he would have killed the Demon Sovereign already without giving the later any chance to explain himself. “Do not be careless. Do not forget the consequences of being careless in the Three Realms.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon swept his gaze over the Demon Sovereigns. When all of them lowered their heads timidly, he turned back towards Li Min’e, “Are you certain of what you said?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m ninety percent sure.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then let us be careful.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other Demon Sovereigns cursed silently, but they had no choice but to follow Black Dragon’s orders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon, another hour passed. During this time, they had been journeying very slowly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They carefully searched the surroundings as they journeyed, even if they were on a plain with no coverings to set up any ambushes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ve been walking for two hours now, but has anyone seen any enemies?” A Demon Sovereign, who had been waiting for Li Min’e to make a fool of herself, sneered. The moment he said that, other Demon Sovereigns who thought the same twitched their mouths.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nope, but our Second Big Sister Li must have an explanation for this. Anything is possible before we reach the capital.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the one who spoke up made it sound like he was speaking up for Li Min’e, it was clearly a makeshift mock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They refused to believe that there were enemies around after two hours of spotting nothing and with the capital in sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Black Dragon started to have his doubts. </span><i><span style>Did she make a mistake because she was overly nervous?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“The scent of blood has become thicker,” Li Min’e maintained her calm in face of all the mockery.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You guys hear that? Second Big Sister Li is trying to tell us that our enemies are at the capital!” The Demon Sovereign who commented the most mocked. The others also shook their heads with snickers as they continued on their paths in anticipation of smacking Li Min’e in the face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Another even enhanced their roar with spiritual energy, “Old Six, stop hiding in the city. We’re back!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on? What’s Old Six doing?” Soon, some Demon Sovereigns frowned. “Why isn’t he defending the city? What if enemies invade the capital?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As they said that, they continued to sneer at Li Min’e. Since they were able to enter the city, they were now completely relaxed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They did not care that Li Min’e continued to remind them that the scent of blood was becoming thicker and thicker.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop!” One of the scouts shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Demon Sovereigns looked at him in confusion. “What happened?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The scout pointed towards the city gate with a tremble.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Demon Sovereigns immediately glanced in the direction he pointed at…</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those who had better eyesight already saw what was on the city wall, while the others quickly asked them what they saw.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Li Min’e spoke up indifferently, “The Old Six you guys were calling out to… is hanging on the city wall.”</span></p>

 <p></p>
 <p>Alright, I screwed up with time management real bad. Between the interview (which you should be able to see soon on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVfwsgGqyOWpJFwG6dpVgxg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Immortal Index's channel</a>), permanent overtime at work and family, I didn't find time to TL RPS at all (which means my&nbsp;stockpile ran out). Thus, I'm not going to be able to release any of the owed/sponsored chapters for you today. What I will be doing though is making sure that I TL at least 2 SMTM and 1 RPS chapter per day on weekdays and more on the weekends so slowly catch back up. Also, I'll be keeping count of how many RPS chapters I owe you guys so I can make it all up to you guys when I go back to Switzerland.&nbsp;<em>I also thought that I release Chapter 722 yesterday, but apparently, I haven't...</em></p>
 <p>Owed Chapters Count: 3 (+sponsored chapters)</p>
