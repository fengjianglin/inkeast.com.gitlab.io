 <p><span style>Life-Saving Monkey Hair</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the hell was this?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: This Monkey Hair can save your life once. Remember, don’t use it until you have no other choice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen finally reacted when he saw the Great Sage’s message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just how did the Journey to the West cartoon song go? A single monkey hair could create ten thousand monkeys!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could it be that hair?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>If it’s like that, then it’s a huge present.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Thank you, Great Sage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: We’re bros, no need to be so courteous. Alright, I, Old Sun, has to go and have a taste of this treasure. Ttyl.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, the Monkey King disappeared. Meanwhile, Ye Zichen clicked open the Treasure Chest to see its description.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey Hair: One of the Great Sage’s three Life-Saving Monkey Hairs, there is miraculous power inside. The actual usage is unknown, the method of usage is unknown.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It really f*cking is!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Gulp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen gulped, then sneakily took the Monkey Hair out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Monkey Hair was a light-yellow color. It was kind of the same with a person’s body hair. If a sudden gust of wind blew in at that moment, he really would lose it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as he was about to put the Monkey Hair back into the Treasure Chest, the little ghost girl, Liu Qing, suddenly floated out from somewhere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This truly scared Ye Zichen, resulting in his hand shaking as he raised his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can you not scare people like that, you’ll scare them to death.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s good, then you can be with me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A hint of shyness flashed across Liu Qing’s eye when she said this. However, Ye Zichen ignored her and set his gaze back onto his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Monkey Hair was gone!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My Monkey Hair!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen said anxiously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What Monkey Hair,” Liu Qing had a dumb and moe look on her face. Ye Zichen raised his hands and pointed at her a few times, but only slapped his thighs out of anger in the end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Life-Saving Monkey Hair, the Life-Saving Monkey Hair that the Great Sage gave him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It was gone.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stared at his empty hands dumbly. He really wanted to slap himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What the heck did he take it out for? That’s great now, it was completely gone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had wanted to look for it, but gave up in the end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Don’t talk about using the Fiery Eyes of Truth, even if there was a microscope, it would be hair to find a piece of hair like that when its fallen onto the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Liu Qing…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pointed at Liu Qing for a long while without saying anything. He can’t exactly get mad at her, this girl didn’t do it on purpose.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he had to blame anyone, he just had to blame his crappy luck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen let out a long sigh, then directly covered his head with the blanket to sleep.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t sleep. Do you have time today?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then when are you going to have a look at Chief Liu’s wife?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“None of your business.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen covered his head with his blanket and completely ignored Liu Qing, who continued to make a ruckus outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>F*ck, the Life-Saving Monkey Hair was just gone like that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the moment he covered himself with the blanket, a light-yellow hair suddenly appeared on his arm, completely hidden within all the other hairs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After finishing a day of lessons, Ye Zichen walked out of the classroom, while dragging his tired body along.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ghost girl, Liu Qing, floated in front of him, just wandering around as she pouted without saying anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can you stop annoying me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stopped. Quite a few students around him heard his words and looked over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, when they saw the empty space in front of him, they all revealed a confused expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After seeing everyone’s gaze, Ye Zichen rubbed his hair and continued to walk out. However, the ghost girl, Liu Qing, floated over with a pout once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, have you considered what I told you this morning?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen ignored her and walked towards the sports field. Liu Qing followed closely behind him and shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you listening or not?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen continued to walk forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stand still!” Liu Qing roared at Ye Zichen due to getting a bit angry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stopped, then looked at Liu Qing with a helpless gaze, while sighing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just what do you want.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing had been really weird recently, she had continuously pestered him to go and treat Chief Liu’s wife.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He has never seen her so warm-hearted before!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want you to treat Chief Liu’s wife.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>See? Again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pretty much listened to this every day, it was to the point that his head was about to explode.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you so worried about Chief Liu’s wife’s sickness? Is she your relative!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m helping you do some good deeds, do you understand?” Liu Qing rolled her eyes and put her hands on her waist. “If someone like you, who does do anything proper and only screw girls over every day, doesn’t do more good deeds, you’ll end up in hell.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can you say something nicer?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s expression darkened, he was only twenty something. Liu Qing made it sound like he was about to die.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t care, hurry up and treat Chief Liu’s wife.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Ye Zichen and Liu Qing were arguing intensely, a white-haired and youthful looking elder appeared in front of Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are Mr. Ye Zichen, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The old man, who suddenly appeared, actually knew him. This caused Ye Zichen to momentarily blank out and nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, why do you know me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The elder laughed softly, then pointed behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a young man, whose hair had been dyed gray, at the place he pointed towards. The young man even waved towards Ye Zichen when he saw that Ye Zichen had looked his way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you mean?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Our family’s young master wants to get to know you,” The young man smiled slightly, and made a “please” gesture.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen twitched his mouth and raised his eyebrow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t want to know your family’s young master.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen wanted to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mr. Ye, if you’re going to be like that, this old man will be very troubled,” the elder raised his arm to stop Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What, this is a university. Do you want to fight me here? Even if you do, you might not be able to match me, old man.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ever since he ate the Body Enhancing Pill and got the secret scripture of the Unbreakable Body, Ye Zichen no longer acted cowardly when it came to fighting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If this old man really wanted to fight him, then he didn’t mind trying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even when the school investigates, Ye Zichen can say that this old man was causing trouble for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mr. Ye, you are definitely unable to be defeated by this old man. But, have you thought about your family?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s expression tensed, as he grabbed the elder’s collar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you mean?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mr. Ye, don’t worry, this old man is just reminding you in good well. The mansion your mother, Ye Rong, lives in, seems to be at Riverside New Town!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clenched his fist and stared at the old man for a long while, then turned around to look at the young man, who was not far away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man waved towards him with a smile once again. After a long while, Ye Zichen took a deep breath, then released the elder and walked towards the young man, who was not far away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mr. Ye.”</span></p>
 <p><span style> The young man smiled kindly and raised his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen hit his hand away, while his eyes were filled with anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your action seems a bit too despicable.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is Mr. Ye saying. I just want to get to know you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man continued to maintain his faint smile. Ye Zichen raised his hand picked the young man up by his collar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m telling you, come at me if there’s anything. If you dare to touch even a hair on my mother, I will make you regret coming to this world.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen chucked the young man onto the school’s grass, then walked towards the sports field without turning back.</span></p>
