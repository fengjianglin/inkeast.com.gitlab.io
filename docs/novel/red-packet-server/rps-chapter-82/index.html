 <p><span style>Chapter 82 – Egotistic Yang Zhen</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within the confines of a luxurious car.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smoked as he crossed his legs and swirled a glass of expensive red wine in another.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A middle-aged man with a sullen expression sat opposite him. That man was Yang Yushi’s father, Yang Zhen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uncle Yang, we haven’t met for a while, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen leaned back in the seat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Zhen looked up with a sharp gaze that others could not meet directly, “Indeed, we haven’t met for a while. But we clearly didn’t meet, isn’t that right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen did not deny what Yang Zhen said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“To be honest, I don’t want to see you either, it seems like you were the one who sought me out,” the corner of Ye Zichen’s mouth revealed a faint smile. He raised his hand and tapped the ashes of his cigarette into that glass of expensive red wine. “Uncle Yang, what do you want to say to me this time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You shouldn’t have met with Yushi.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn’t want to do that either,” Ye Zichen pursed his lips and smiled. “I also hope that she can live her new life.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But you interrupted it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The light in Yang Zhen’s eyes faded, what replaced it was a sharpness that could not be met.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his head, and met his gaze with a soft reply, “Then what do you want?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is an one million cheque…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha…” Ye Zichen laughed the moment Yang Zhen took out the cheque.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Three years ago, Yang Zhen used a cheque like that to destroy all of Ye Zichen’s dignity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Three years later, it was the same scene, same conversation and same cheque.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uncle Yang, I will call you uncle once again due to Yushi,” Ye Zichen pursed his lips, while his eyes were filled with hints of mockery. “Did you think that money really can solve everything? And money was almighty?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Zhen’s face grew dark. He used his incomparably sharp gaze to stare right at Ye Zichen, but what he got in response was unending mockery.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you really doing it for Yushi’s own good? You got rid of all of the pursuers around her, and when she becomes an adult, you will get her to step into the wedding that you selected for her, in order live the life of a rich married woman that normal people can only look up to. You think this is the happiness you are bringing for her, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What a joke. If you put it in a nice way, it’s just that you don’t want Yushi to suffer in the second half of her life. If I were to put it in a nasty way, aren’t you doing it for business alliances, so that your career can develop further? Am I right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won’t disturb Yushi’s life, and you have no need to worry about me having ill intentions. But please believe me. If Yushi doesn’t like the fate you designed for her, then I will shatter that very fate with my own hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do not doubt my words, and don’t think of threatening me with my mother. Otherwise, if I go crazy, you can’t handle it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Ye Zichen spoke, the mockery on his face became more and more apparent. He picked up the cheque off the table and ripped it into countless pieces that scattered onto the floor of the car, in front of Yang Zhen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“To be honest, this bit of money is completely worthless to the current me. Oh yeah, let me remind you, go and do a full body check-up at the hospital when you have time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen pushed open the car door and walked away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Zhen sat straight on the sofa of the car, while Ye Zichen’s words echoed in his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A servant walked over from the side. Yang Zhen took a glance at the cheque pieces on the floor, then raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Clean this up and bring young mistress home.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s heart was unable to return to its normal calmness even after a long while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He leaned back against a willow tree by the side of the road and started to smoke his cigarette. At the same time, his heart was filled with mockery for Yang Zhen and pity for Yang Yushi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Getting a stubborn father was her misfortune, but it was also her fortune.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At least, her father loved her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing floated beside Ye Zichen without saying anything. She could feel that he was in a really bad mood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you have a lot of things you want to ask?” Ye Zichen suddenly looked up and smiled towards Liu Qing. “Actually, Yang Yushi and I were a couple three years ago. The one just now was her father. As you can probably imagine, he tore us apart back then.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing raised her eyebrows. Actually, she had already guessed what was going on, but it was different when Ye Zichen admitted it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Such a pity.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pity?” Ye Zichen shook his head and smiled. “Isn’t this what a father should do? He didn’t want his daughter to suffer, especially with a poor brat like me…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If it was my dad, he definitely wouldn’t have done that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing’s eyes were filled with certainty. Ye Zichen rubbed her head when he saw her like that, while gentleness filled his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But, speaking to your ex-girlfriend’s father like that isn’t really good, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Liu Qing slowly spoke once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes and cursed, “This is all because I gave him face, okay? If it wasn’t for him, I would be doing it a second time. That’s great now, my proper business got screwed up, can’t I not get angry? It was already nice of me not hitting him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You… shameless!” Liu Qing screamed out, and raised her hand to hit him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen quickly ran away, but heard someone call out towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Ye Zichen stopped and turned around, only to find that it was Su Yan calling him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen felt a rather regretful when he faced this goddess who was beyond a friend, but not yet a lover.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had pondered about how to get that extra point of affability level, but he just couldn’t find the chance to.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen gave Liu Qing a cue, signaling her not to cause trouble, then ran to Su Yan’s side with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan immediately wrapped her arms around Ye Zichen and secretly gave him a cue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did he notice a girl with very heavy make-up beside Su Yan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the girl saw Su Yan hug Ye Zichen, her eyes subconsciously revealed a sign of displeasure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Su Yan, introduce us?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gao Chang, he’s my boyfriend, Ye Zichen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boyfriend?” Gao Chang raised her eyebrows and checked Ye Zichen out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, a hint of disdain sparked in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Su Yan, you were a flower in our class, you should be a school beauty even in university, you got a boyfriend of that level?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What do you mean “that level”?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was annoyed.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>How was his level low?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Girl, you’re sick,” Ye Zichen glared at her and said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re the one who’s sick!” Gao Chang yelled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t believe me? You’re actually sick. Go and have a checkup at the hospital when you have time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan pulled Ye Zichen’s arm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Gao Chang also snorted, “Su Yan, I came here just to pass along a message. ‘It’s our high school reunion soon. Young Master Bai will also be there, compare him with the one beside you… Zeze, think about how much effort Young Master Bai put into you. Do as you see fit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Gao Chang revealed that look of disdain once again. She twitched her mouth towards Ye Zichen and drove away in a Beetle parked at the side of the road.</span></p>
