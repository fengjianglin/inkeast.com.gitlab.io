 <p><span style>Ye Zichen dragged his knackered body back home.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘There were no foreign objects.’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Modern science had proved that there were no traces of the Soul Pearl Yiyuan in his head at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you sure that the Soul Pearl Yiyuan went into my head?” Ye Zichen sat on the bedroom bed and looked at Liu Qing with a look of confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Such a large glass bead entered his head just like that. </span><i><span style>Was it really was f*cking like Xuanhuan novels, where a drop of blood was able to tie a treasure to oneself and allow it to be hidden within the body of the owner?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“It really went inside,” Liu Qing nodded with certainty. She had seen with her own eyes that the glass bead just went between his eyebrows and disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That’s weird...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen cursed in his heart since the X-ray didn’t show anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What made him even more speechless was that he didn’t know how to get the glass bead back out.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Liu Qing’s revival required it to soak in rootless water!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen waved his hand bitterly, then fell across the bed and slept.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where the f*ck did these people come from? Ye Zichen, come the f*ck out of your room.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The next morning, Ye Zichen heard a round of intense banging on his door while everything was still blurry for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He already slept quite late the previous night, and after he prepared to sleep, his brain started to play a movie the moment his eyes closed.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>And it was another damn martial arts film!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>After finally falling asleep just now…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck!” Ye Zichen crawled up from the bed with red eyes, then walked to open the door of his room with bare feet. “The f*ck are you screaming for so early in the morning?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Di Tian, who was standing at the doorway was stunned for a brief moment. Not long after that, he swung his braid around and pointed at the monkeys who were stretching in the living room, “What the hell is up with them? You’re f*cking making me stay with a few manual laborers?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who gave you the courage to look down upon manual laborers?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Anybody could get cranky from waking up. Due to this, Ye Zichen was still angry that this grandson had disturbed his good sleep so early in the morning.</span><span class="hidden-text">This chapter is transated by Selutu on volarenovels. That is where you can find the most updated translations. If you read this anywhere else, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pushed Di Tian away, then shouted towards Eldest Hou, “This grandson swore at you guys, do as you wish!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdongdang…</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Third Fatty Jin pushed open the bedroom door sleepily to see the situation outside, the battle had already ended.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Di Tian had been completely slaughtered. He was beaten until bruises completely covered his face, as he squatted in the corner without daring to look up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is for you acting cocky. Do you really think that nobody can control you here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Di Tian submitted.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck, I thought that I could become king without the presence of the Great Sage at home.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Who would have thought that Ye Zichen would actually have Spiritual Body level bodyguards? And it had to be four.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Di Tian could only hug his head and squat to the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Ye Zichen ignored him and look towards the monkey brothers, “Have you guys decided on what I told you guys?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The four Hou brothers immediately looked at each other, then their big bro, Eldest Hou, walked forward and bowed, “We’ll follow you, but you have to let us see the Immortal Heart of Pure Yang.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Immortal Heart of Pure Yang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Third Fatty Jin, who was standing sleepily by the door, quickly ran over with a coy smile after hearing that, “Boss, I want to learn too…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aren’t you Great Emperor Qingming’s disciple? What do you want to learn it for!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes, then took out pen and paper to write down the cultivation mantra for the first level for the Hou brothers and Third Fatty Jin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It really is the Immortal Heart of Pure Yang…” The Hou brothers were beyond excited, while Third Fatty Jin also nearly cried out in excitement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only Di Tian covered his head and squatted on the floor with a look of confusion, “What is the Immortal Heart of Pure Yang?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t even know the Immortal Heart of Pure Yang, it seems like your Di Family doesn’t have too high of a position over there!” Third Fatty Jin’s face with a mocking expression, then snorted proudly as he put his hands on his waist. “The Immortal Heart of Pure Yang…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Fatty Jin decided to speak about the Immortal Heart of Pure Yang with a tsundere-look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The eyes of Di Tian, who was squatting on the floor, lit up, “Young Master Ye, can I…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You want to learn it?” Ye Zichen smiled warmly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Di Tian instantly nodded like a rattle drum.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Great Deity Lü’s cultivation secret art was something that must be learned, ah.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, f*ck off!” Ye Zichen’s warm smile instantly turned as cold as ice cubes. At the same time, he took a glance at Third Fatty Jin and the four Hou brothers, “I don’t like the look of him…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdongdang…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This grandson was acted so cockily towards me the previous night, I have to teach him a lesson properly.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Within a certain high-class commercial clubhouse.</span><span class="hidden-text">This chapter is transated by Selutu on volarenovels. That is where you can find the most updated translations. If you read this anywhere else, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen appeared within the clubhouse with the four Hou brothers proudly. Now that he had these four great people on his side, Yu or anyone else was useless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen pushed open the door to the room, he saw that Xiao Hai and Su Yiyun had already stood up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on? I just arrived.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s you that have come so late,” Xiao Yumei rolled her eyes. “Director Xiao, Young Master Su and I have already signed the contract.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was speechless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He admits that he delayed coming out a bit because he wanted to kick Di Tian a few more times!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi, we won’t blabber too much here. See ya,” Su Yiyuan smiled towards Ye Zichen, then nodded slightly towards Xiao Yumei before leaving from the room with Xiao Hai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What exactly is going on?”</span><span class="hidden-text">This chapter is transated by Selutu on volarenovels. That is where you can find the most updated translations. If you read this anywhere else, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When I called you just now, it was because I was worried that Director Xiao and Young Master Su would doubt my words. However, these two brothers of yours signed without even thinking twice,” An excited light shone in Xiao Yumei’s eyes, with their investment…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The medical company can definitely stabilize now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that so? How much did they invest?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei stretched out her right hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fifty million?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Five hundred million, idiot,” Xiao Yumei pouted. &nbsp;“It’s five hundred million, but they are only taking thirty percent of the company’s shares in total!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It really was difficult to understand the world of rich people.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Five hundred million!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had never seen so much money in his life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei raised her hand to pinch him on the cheek when she saw his stunned look, “Little man, big sis truly loves you so much when I see how cute you are.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was speechless once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen flirted with Xiao Yumei for ten-odd minutes more before realizing that the four Hou brothers were beside him!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh yeah, I got two bodyguards for you,” Ye Zichen crooked his fingers at Eldest Hou and Second Hou. “Call your proprietress.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Proprietress!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Eldest Hou and Second Hou nodded obediently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Ye Zichen also begun to explain to Xiao Yumei, “These two could be described as elites among the elites of bodyguards. With them here, if Huo Da dares to harass you again, then tell them to beat him up. If they don’t beat the shit out of that grandson, it just means that he let it all out the previous day!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei couldn’t help but giggle, then hit him with a soft fist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So dirty.”</span><span class="hidden-text">This chapter is transated by Selutu on volarenovels. That is where you can find the most updated translations. If you read this anywhere else, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hehe!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled dumbly towards her. When he saw her beautiful and shy face, Ye Zichen couldn’t help but gulp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as he was about to tell the Hou brothers to go out so he could play a bit with her…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Buzz!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The phone in his pocket rang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Ye Zichen answered the call, his expression tensed as he said sullenly.</span><span class="hidden-text">This chapter is transated by Selutu on volarenovels. That is where you can find the most updated translations. If you read this anywhere else, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll be right there.”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Original Chapter Teaser:[expand]</strong></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:</strong>&nbsp;Sighs... As expected, the hospital results show nothing. How the hell am I supposed to get the pearl out!?</p>
 <p><strong>Liu Qing:</strong>&nbsp;Just cut your head open, I'm sure you'll find something.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>... Why is such a cute little girl like you so evil? Anyways, are you sure that the pearl went into my head?</p>
 <p><strong>Liu Qing:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, I saw it.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Are you sure that you're sure? Like sure sure?</p>
 <p><strong>Liu Qing:</strong>&nbsp;Yes I'm sure. I'm sure sure sure!</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Fine. Let's go back home. It's about time to find out those monkeys' decisions.</p>
