<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p><span style>Chapter 115 – Zhuge Kongming</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sat at the counter of the supermarket, while ten concert tickets that Yang Yushi got people to send over laid on the table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You never imagined that big bro has tickets on hand, right? And they’re even infield tickets,” Ye Zichen had a faint hint of pride on his face. The reason Su Yan and Xia Keke messed with him so weirdly earlier was for these concert tickets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no helping it, Yang Yushi’s reputation was through the roof.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two girls already tried to snatch up tickets the moment the tickets sales opened, but they were too slow. When they confirmed the purchases, the five thousand tickets were already swept up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They only went to Ye Zichen because he had contacts with Hu Hong, so they wanted him to try and get a few.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, they made a strict order that he must get the tickets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen put the tickets in his pocket with a smile, then leaned back on the chair as he looked at the huge supermarket. All of a sudden, his face became troubled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He thought that the sales in the Heavenly Court would start extremely quickly, but none of the spokespeople contacted him to stock up. Nor did any deities ask him to buy the products.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Could the deities in the Heavenly Court not like this?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It shouldn’t be!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The Monkey King and co. had pretty good feedback.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Creak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The door to the supermarket pushed open. Ye Zichen stared at his phone without looking up, “It’s not opened yet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen would meet this sort of situation quite a few times per day. Normally speaking, the moment he said that, the customers would leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, this time, this person actually continued to stand in front of him and did not leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked up, and saw that a boy, wearing a pair of glasses with black frames, stood in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was still a hint of naiveté on his face, so he most likely wasn’t above 18.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Bro, our supermarket isn’t opened yet, so we don’t sell anything.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The boy raised his hand and scratched his head, “I didn’t come to buy anything.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you come here for if not to buy? To sell? I have fixed suppliers, so I don’t need to stock up from other places.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, no,” The boy shook his head like a rattle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was also confused by the child, thus he asked, “Then what?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The boy finally spoke up with a blush after a long while, “Are you employing?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ugh.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Employing.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Just how old is this kid, and he’s already applying for a job?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The boy quickly promoted himself as if he sensed Ye Zichen’s intention of refusal, “Bro, don’t just look at how young I am. I have the stamina to do stuff like putting the products onto the shelves and moving the products. From the looks of it, you should be an university student as well. You definitely have to study, right? I can live 24 hours within the supermarket, and I can promise you not to eat any of the snacks or touch the money in the cash register.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This child seemed rather sincere, but the thing is…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t plan to open it to the public at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Without any choice, he could only make up an excuse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t accept child labor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, that’s simple. For shops like supermarkets, just say that I’m the child from a relative’s home, and is just helping out. That’s all!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as if the boy had thought about all sorts of possibilities beforehand. No matter what excuses Ye Zichen came up with, he was able to answer without thinking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, Ye Zichen was troubled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sighed as he looked at the boy’s anticipating gaze, “Then tell me, why are you so desperate for a job. Don’t you need to go to school?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No,” The boy shook his head, then his expression turned sad. “I’m an orphan, I have no place to live and nowhere to eat, I want to find a place that offers me food and shelter. Big bro, just accept me. I will work very hard, it’s fine even if you don’t pay me a salary, it’s…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The child made himself sound more and more pitiful, but Ye Zichen checked him out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The child was wearing high grade goods on his entire body. Although Ye Zichen haven’t bought any, he was forced by Yao Yue to recognize a lot of brands when he was still dating her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ignoring everything else this child was wearing, just his Balenciaga shoes cost more than ten thousand yuan.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Orphan!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Who was he bullshitting with!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Bro, do you think Big bro doesn’t understand anything?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This child definitely had other intentions wanting to work here. Since Ye Zichen had nothing better to do, he decided to chat with the child.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Say, you are wearing at least a hundred thousand yuan of clothes and you’re telling me that you’re an orphan. Do the orphanages have such good benefits now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment he finished, Ye ZIchen saw a look of worry on the boy’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled, then casually took out a cigarette from the counter and lit it. He raised his eyebrows, “So, introduce yourself first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m called Zhuge Kongming.”</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>Ye Zichen nearly choked on the cigarette and coughed intensely. Then he said with a frown, “Look, you have a two-character surname. If you said that you’re called Goudan <a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>, then I would believe it. Yet, you said Zhuge, your orphanage is truly impressive.”</span></span></p>
 <p><span style><span>“I admired Mr. Wolong <a id="footnoteref-3" href="#footnote-3">[3]</a> since I was young, so wasn’t it fine if I named myself Zhuge Kongming?” Zhuge Kongming said with a blush and forcefully raised his head.</span></span></p>
 <p><span style><span>Ye ZIchen immediately laughed, “Oh, you want to be Zhuge Liang. Then sorry, I’m not Lei Bei, I don’t need your assistance. What’s more, you, Zhuge Kongming, are too shameless. I didn’t visit your place three times <a id="footnoteref-4" href="#footnote-4">[4]</a>, yet you already ran over excitedly, it’s not like you at all.”</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhuge Kongming pouted unhappily, while Ye Zichen crossed his legs and pointed towards the door, “Mr. Zhuge, please.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big bro, just take me in. Let me be your lackey, okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nope, hurry up and leave, otherwise, I’m going to beat you up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye ZIchen frowned to reveal a savage look. However, Zhuge Kongming frowned, then directly said shamelessly as he fell onto the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then let’s just stay like this and see.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe… You’re scaring me! Then let’s just keep on wasting our time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Several hours passed by, and the sky had already turned dark, this Zhuge Kongming really sat on the floor without moving at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What Ye Zichen found weird was that his family did not come and get him. This was something that Ye Zichen did not understand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zhuge Kongming, is your family not worried about you when you’re not going home when it’s so late?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I said, I’m an orphan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then be an orphan,” Ye Zichen twitched his mouth, then stretched lazily. “I’m so hungry, let’s eat a cup of cup noodles.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, the smell of cup noodles filled the entire supermarket.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The stomach of Zhuge Kongming, who was sitting on the floor, grumbled as he looked at the cup noodle on the cash register counter and gulped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen saw all of this. He picked up one of the cup noodles and walked in front of Zhuge Kongming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you want to eat it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhuge Kongming did not hesitate at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was starving!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then tell me honestly, what exactly did you come here for? I’ll let you eat it if you just say it.”</span></p>
