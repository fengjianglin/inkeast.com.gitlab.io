 <p><span style>Chapter 165 – Transferal with One Yuan</span></p>
 <p><span style>The female supervisor’s voice wasn’t soft at all, so quite a few customers within the shop looked over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled wryly with a shrug when he felt the gazes of the surrounding people, “Beauty, are your words because you think I can’t afford to buy them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you think you can afford it?” The supervisor said mercilessly, then turned to scold the clerk. “What’s with you, just taking the ring out for any random person. Are you going insane due to the desire for money?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jiang-jie, the customer wanted to look at them, so I…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You still dare to rebut me?” The supervisor glared, then scolded angrily. “Older sister will take the chance to give you a lesson. You see what he’s wearing? It’s less than a total of one thousand yuan. Don’t just look at the brand name, it’s a fake. Do you think someone like him can even begin to afford the rings here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stood on the side and watched in interest without getting angry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter what, he has experienced this sort of situation several times already, so he had previously got used to it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Xia Keke was unwilling to just listen in!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Woman, why are you speaking like that? Is there anyone that looks down on people like you do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sis, you look like you haven’t graduated from university yet, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style> The supervisor looked at Xia Keke’s childish face and laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s none of your business whether I’ve graduated or not,” Xia Keke frowned, then said seriously. “I’m telling you that looking down on people like what you’re doing is wrong.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The supervisor shook her head with a smile, while the disdain she had towards Ye Zichen became even more apparent, “Sis, you’re still young. After you graduated from university, you’ll understand that love is useless. For example, the little guy beside you, he might be pretty good at flirting, but you won’t end up anywhere with him.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peasant-like or just a slave to money!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>That was exactly what kind of behavior the supervisor displayed.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rubbed his nose, then pulled on Xia Keke, who still wanted to argue with the supervisor. After which, he turned towards the clerk, “Please take out the rings, I want to have a look at the rings.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you so stubborn, and so thick skinned?” The supervisor frowned, then push Ye Zichen to the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During so, Xia Keke, who was standing on the side, fell to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s something f*cking wrong with you, right?” Ye Zichen shouted at the supervisor angrily, then helped Xia Keke up from the floor. After repeatedly checking to ensure that she wasn’t hurt, he walked in front of the supervisor with a frown. “I didn’t want to talk with you from the start, stop f*cking getting full of yourself. If you apologize to Keke now, then I’ll treat it as if nothing has happened.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh? You dare to shout at laoniang. Security!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, a few guards rushed over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Throw him out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen licked his lips and revealed a playful smile when he saw the glaring guards.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>They wanted to use force!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you sure that you’re not going to apologize?” Ye Zichen glanced at the supervisor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She revealed a smile of disdain, “What are you guys blanking out for? Throw him out!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The guards didn’t dare to disobey her. </span><i><span style>This woman was their shop manager’s mistress, it was something that everyone in the shop knew.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>She did frequently act rather cockily with the shop manager as backing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the other side were customers, they had to throw him out for their jobs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir, please go out,” The guards did a ‘please’ hand gesture.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen twisted his neck and smiled towards Xia Keke, “Wait for me at the side.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay,” Xia Keke obediently ran to the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen cracked the bones on his body and smiled playfully, “Come together.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as the guards were able to rush up to him, an angry roar sounded out from outside the jewelry store.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The supervisor, who was mocking Ye Zichen with her arms around her, immediately displayed a frightened expression, while the guards also stopped and lowered their heads.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Director Zu.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ancestor?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What a familiar name!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen turned his head back, then saw Zu Siliang frowning heavily as he walked over with a woman with a golden framed glasses beside him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Ye.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is Young Master Zu’s property?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen revealed a playful smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zu Siliang suddenly reached out his hand and raised his eyebrows, “Yes, this is indeed my property, but it won’t be very soon. I wonder if Brother Ye has any cash? Any amount is fine. Give it to me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, hey, hey. That’s a bit too much isn’t it? I got bullied on your turf and you’re actually asking me for money.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Ye, just give it to me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen took out a wrinkled one yuan note and placed it into Zu Siliang’s hand as he rolled his eyes furiously, “I just have this much, take it or leave it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s enough,” Zu Siliang placed the note into his secretary’s hand and shrugged with a smile. “Okay, this shop now belongs to Brother Ye.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the hell!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zu Siliang chuckled, “I transferred this jewelry shop to Brother Ye with the price of one yuan. I’ll get my secretary to draft up the contract later, but Brother Ye can act out the owner’s duties now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brat, you know how to act.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye ZIchen pointed at Zu Siliang and shook his head with a smile. He didn’t think that this guy would do something like this.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Showing off!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen loved it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen took a glance at the supervisor with a stark white expression and walked beside the female secretary with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Contact the shop manager of this shop. The fact that a puny supervisor dares to be so cocky means that there definitely is someone behind her. Tell him that he’s fired, “Then, Ye Zichen turned to the clerk that had helped him from the beginning. “From now on, you’re the shop manager.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Me… Me?” The clerk didn’t think that such a huge favor would fall on top of her head. She looked at Zu Siliang in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t look at me. This shop belongs to Brother Ye. If he said that you’re the shop manager, then you’re the shop manager.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since the clerk still didn’t wrap her mind around what had happened, Ye Zichen waved a few times in front of her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lucky girl, stop blanking out. Right now, the supervisor of your shop is bullying your boss, you know what you should do, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I…” The clerk bit her lips, then walked over in front of the supervisor with a determined look in her eyes. “Jiang Yan, you’re fired. Go to Finance to calculate your salary.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, the clerk put her hands in front of her and smiled towards the customers within the shop, “Sorry, we’ve shocked everyone. As an apology, our shop has a ten percent discount on everything!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The clerk’s performance surprised even Zu Siliang, who was standing on the side.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Very capable.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>A talent!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>After dealing with everything properly, the clerk resumed her timid look and bit her lips, “Boss, do you think I handled everything alright?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t ask me, you’re the shop manager, do whatever you want,” Ye Zichen patted her on her shoulders and glanced at her badge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Li Shuang, not bad. I’ll be handing this shop to you from now on.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay boss, I’ll do my best to run this store.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I believe you,” Ye Zichen gave Li Shuang a trusting smile, then glanced at Zu Siliang. “Young Master Zu, I wonder what business do you have with this one?”</span></p>
