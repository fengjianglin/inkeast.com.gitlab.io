 <p><span style>Chapter 348 – Great Battle (1)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Helheim!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Lu raised her hand up in the air, causing the training ground to instantly be covered in snow and ice. Thick ice covered the floor, while the demons who were enjoying the pleasure of the hunt froze into ice sculptures.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh,” Qiu Yin merely laughed coldly when he saw that. He kept his left hand in his pocket, and raised his right hand, “Shatter.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he said those words softly, purple mist swirled around the training field, while the ice encasing the demons begun to crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A hint of shock flashed across Lu Lu’s pale blue eyes. She could feel that the purple mist was cutting off her connection with the ice sculptures.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ouch,” at that moment, the meatball-like fatty stepped on the ice, slipped, then bumped into Qiu Yin. “F*ck this, little girl, your ice is too slippery. I, Lord Fatty, am not wearing slip-resistant shoes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the fatty continued to complain, he managed to cut off Qiu Yin’s demonic energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Lu used the chance to quickly reestablish her connection with the ice sculptures, frowned, then yelled out, “Shatter.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the ice sculptures shattered into tiny crystals.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Qiu Yin watched the tribesmen which he brought over die within the ice sculptures, his pupils instantly turned blood red.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He glared in front of him and formed a powerful fist…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Die!” Qiu Yin’s fist smashed towards Fatty’s back, which was turned towards him, with tremendous force.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lord Fatty, be careful,” Gou Yuzhan held a stick which he had gotten from an unknown place in his hand, and leapt into the air, smashing the stick down onto Qiu Yin’s head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The wooden stick instantly snapped in two.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Feeling the hit, Qiu Yin looked up with his crimson eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gou Yuzhan gulped, scratched his head with a wry smile, then looked down at the broken stick in his hands, “Uhm… Lord Fatty, save me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he shouted, he begun to turn around to run. However, since they were on ice, Gou Yuzhan slipped… Then fell onto the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck, your Helheim is definitely made to screw your teammates over,” Gou Yuzhan cursed in annoyance as he laid on the floor. Qiu Yin looked over at him with his blood red eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A playful smile surfaced on Gou Yuzhan’s face. He held a delicate cross in his hands, and flipped over…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Holy Light Illumination.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A blinding light was released from the cross. When the holy light shone onto Qiu Yin, his bronze colored skin instantly started to corrode and release an azure gas if the light was acidic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The smoke was filled with a gut-revolting stench. Meanwhile, Qiu Yin also let out a pitiful cry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kid, not bad, you’re pretty smart!” the fatty pulled Gou Yuzhan up from the ground with a soft smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gou Yuzhan instantly laughed idiotically after brushing off his bum, then ran over to Lu Lu and pointed at the ice to retort, “Just look at your ice layer. We’re teammates… If it wasn’t because of me having a cross, then I would have gotten ripped apart by the nigga.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Girlie, your ice surface is truly screwing your teammates over!” Fatty Yin also retorted on the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe…. A sinister laugh sounded out from behind them. The demonic energy around Qiu Yin suddenly intensified, causing everyone to only be able to see a pair of shimmering red eyes amidst the black mist. “Are you finished arguing? Very well, you guys successfully pissed me off.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…” a hint of terror flashed across Gou Yuzhan’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty Yin squinted his eyes, then turned to the Gu family head, “Take your tribesmen away, this is no longer a fight you can particularly win.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You want to leave? Stay!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoosh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Intense wind started to blow, sending splinters of rock and ice to spray out, while the demonic energy became even denser.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Crap.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty Yin’s playful gaze begun to turn solemn. When he suddenly made a decision in his heart, he kneeled onto the ground and slapped the ice surface with force using his right hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ice surface on the ground rose up, forming a wall of ice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, he turned towards the Gu family head and shouted, “Take your people and hurry away. Right now, they are only a burden for us if they stay.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay,” the Gu family head was not an indecisive person. With a roar, he immediately took the terrorized Gu clan members and moved towards the outside quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, laughter sounded out all around them, “This sovereign already said it. Nobody can leave!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sinister and chilling laugh caused everyone’s mood to sullen, and some of the Gu clan members directly freaked out and fell onto the ground when they heard it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Die!” the illusion of a huge demon leaped them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Fatty Yin also looked up speechlessly and retorted, “O Main body, if you still refuse to come, then laozi is done with all this!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My good son, did you miss me these last few days?” Tuoba Ye’s face always carried a cold smile, while he occasionally opened up the fan in his hand and fanned himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the very beginning, Ye Zichen stared at the man with an indifferent gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Without a single word.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My good son, I came for a reason different to Qiu Yin’s. Although I’m a demon, I still keep my promises. I promised the Gu clan to not do anything to them for a hundred years. This time… I purely want to take you back to the demon realm!” Tuoba Ye smiled, but Ye Zichen continued to remain silent. “Hehe… You don’t want to talk to dad that much? What? Are you worried about the situation over there?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There isn’t anything to worry about. Your demon brothers won’t be able to do anything extreme with Fatty and co. there,” only then did Ye Zichen smiled faintly. He glanced directly at Tuoba Ye’s smile, then cracked his neck. “You actually said you, someone of the demon race, keeps his word. Do you think I’ll trust you!? If you truly would keep your word, and will ensure that the Gu clan has a hundred years of peace. Then… Go, kill that person called Qiu Yin.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We demons are different from you humans. We won’t fight among ourselves,” Tuoba Ye chuckled. “But, if you come with me, it’s not like I can’t help you guys! The only criteria is that… You are still a Fallen!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fallen?” Ye Zichen smiled playfully. Then, a pair of black wings suddenly appeared on his back. However, neither his skin color, hair color nor eye color changed this time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was still able to maintain his own consciousness as he chuckled coldly at Tuoba Ye’s blatant displeasure, “You mean like this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A crazed and heated look surfaced in Tuoba Ye’s eyes. He laughed maniacally and opened his mouth wide.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, yes, yes. Just like this… As expect of my son. A Fallen… A Fallen!” Tuoba Ye clenched his fist tightly and roared out excitedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen maintained his cold smile, and indicated towards Qiu Yin, “Kill him. If you kill him, then I’ll leave with you!”</span></p>
