 <p><span style>Chapter 287 – Ice Empress Lu Lu!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The cold voice resonated from all around them, causing Wei Teng, who was hiding behind the wall, to shudder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wei Teng grabbed a cigarette for himself from his father and lit it, “Dad, who is the person that just arrived?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wei Chen glanced towards the cave, then shrugged, “A great Yao that is quite famous in the Three Realms!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yao? You said that it is a Yao that has come?” Wei Teng raised his eyebrows. “Then why is the Yao helping that brat? Also, why do you always have to protect him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why do you bullshit around so much. Just stay here and come with me to clean up the battlefield once everything settles,” Wei Chen twitched his mouth and kicked Wei Teng on his ass.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fine...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, the ice-cold voice seemed to have even lowered the temperature of the cave by a few degrees…</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the ice-cold voice resounded, a thin layer of ice gradually appeared on the snakeman leader, who had been on the verge of success.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The snakeman leader immediately discarded that arm without thinking and rushed backwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who is it!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re very decisive!” A playful chuckle tinkled. Not long later, Ye Zichen saw Lu Lu, who was in green clothes, put on a chilling smile, while she radiated an unbearable frigidness to her surroundings… “If you were just slightly slower, you might be like that snake girl now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Lu looked towards the snake girl. The snake girl, who was messing with the Hou brothers all by herself just moments ago, had already turned into an ice sculpture.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Snap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Lu snapped her fingers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ice sculpture instantly shattered into countless pieces, while the snakegirl encased ceased to be.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment it happened, the Hou brothers involuntarily shuddered. They never expected that the girl who beat them up the other day was actually so fierce. At the same time, they also felt fortunate that they weren’t frozen…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Otherwise… The result was terrifying even when they merely thought about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen also shivered and looked at Lu Lu in shock.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>My god!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Too fierce.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You-You are the Ice Empress!” The snakeman leader at the entrance of the cave started to shiver uncontrollably.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Lu smiled softly, then curled her lips, “Oh? You actually know of me! You come from the Three Realms? But since you know me, you still dared to make a move on my person? Don’t you know my history with him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ba-dump.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The snakeman leader kneeled down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ice Empress was an existence that could shake the Three Realms with a stomp of her feet. Yet, while the snakeman leader was in the Three Realms, he was merely a lackey of the half-beastmen’s snakemen tribe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ice Empress, please have mercy on this puny one.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the only response to him was the ice that begun to appear on his body, which very soon covered the snakeman leader and turned him into another ice sculpture.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hilarious. You actually want to stay alive even after making a move on my person!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Snap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Lu Lu snapped her fingers, the newest ice sculpture shattered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moonlight flickered and shimmered as it was reflected by the pieces of ice and fell to the ground, while Ye Zichen also ran into the cave the moment the ice sculpture shattered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mother Ye and co. laid peacefully on the straw mattress within the depths of the cave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Lu Lu also walked in, “Don’t worry, they merely fainted due to the snake poison. They’ll wake up after a while.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded happily after hearing that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Lu also acted like she sought out praise, “C'mon and tell me, how do you want to thank me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You… couldn’t have come over following my scent again, right?” Ye Zichen scratched his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm,” Lu Lu smiled. “I did follow your scent over. It was fortunate that I did, otherwise, you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded silently.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Indeed, if Lu Lu had not appeared in time, I really might have just passed onto afterlife.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, that only made him hate his own weakness even more.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>If I wasn’t this weak, my family would not have gotten into danger. I need power, and not just physical power for myself, I also need a bunch of subordinates who are loyal to me.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Lu Lu smiled, “The snakemen are merely the weakest existences among the half-beastmen. You will have more and more tribulations in the future. You should start to establish your own power. In your previous reincarnations, you always had your own force!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>We seem to have thought about the same thing.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen also realized that he needed to gather people and build his own force.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>But from where?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I only have four monkeys with me and a Fatty Jin with his spiritual power sealed. That’s pretty much it.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Who is it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Lu Lu raised her eyebrows and chucked an icicle towards the worn-down wall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The rocks shattered, revealing Wei Chen, Wei Teng and a group of men, who walked over with coy smiles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t… Comrades, comrades!” Wei Chen put his hands up with a coy smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Lu glanced over at Ye Zichen, and only put her hands down when she saw him nod.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Lu glanced at Wei Chen and frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>False Earth Immortal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From what she could see, the person in front of her should not be limited to just that!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, he was indeed of the False Earth Immortal level judging from his celestial spiritual energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Mater Ye, chivalrous woman…” Wei Chen nodded with a forced smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen also raised his eyebrows, “You came to protect me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah,” Wei Chen clapped his hands. “Big Sis Keke ordered us to protect your safety 24 hours a day.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Keke as in Xia Keke?” Lu Lu asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, he’s Wei Chen, as he has said, he’s Keke’s subordinate,” Ye Zichen explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wei Chen nodded, then shouted towards his subordinates, “Go cleanup the battlefield.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The subordinates immediately ran out, but before they made any actual distance, Lu Lu signaled Ye Zichen, “No need!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shroom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The corpses on the ground all became ice sculptures, then immediately shattered, leaving nothing behind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it wasn’t for the air still containing faint smells of gore, and the blood on the ground, it would be very hard to imagine that an intense battle had occurred there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Ye Zichen thought about Lu Lu’s cold gaze from earlier, his sights landed on Wei Chen’s subordinates, causing him to look towards Wei Chen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wei Chen, who was smiling coyly, felt rather disturbed by Ye Zichen’s gaze, so he couldn’t help but ask in a testing manner, “Young Master Ye, what is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How many subordinates do you have?” Ye Zichen asked straightfowardly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Several tens of people!” Wei Chen answered honestly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded in response.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Ye Rong and co., who were within the cave, woke up dazedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen?” A weak call sounded out from behind him, causing Ye Zichen, who was in deep thought, to be surprised, before he ran into the cave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mom, Tiantian, Jinglei-jie!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you here?” Mother Ye’s face was filled with shock. Then she looked over at the surrounding people. “You even brought so many people. There’s blood on you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t mind everything so much,” Ye Zichen smiled towards his mother and helped up her. “Let’s go home!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, let’s go home,” Ye Rong also smiled tiredly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Ye Zichen passed by Wei Chen, he looked at Wei Chen meaningfully, “Find a time to meet tomorrow!”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Original Chapter Teaser:</b>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>In your next chapter of Red Packet Server, you will meet...</span></p>
 <p><span style><del datetime="2017-10-04T19:20:27+00:00">Elsa</del> &lt;Spoiler Name&gt;. He/She is most definitely not an ice <em>witch</em>, not at all. After all, witches use magic and we're in a xianxia setting, so he/she is most definitely a cultivator.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>You may ask "of what kind"? Well, ice. Duh.</p>
 <p>Is she hot? When is a semi-important female character in xianxia novels not hot?</p>
 <p>Tiantian? Fine, but she's a kid and our MC's darling daughter so she doesn't count. &gt;.&lt;</p>
 <p>So... Why is she there? Of course she's there to save Ye Zichen! He's already got the kid-like busty beauty, the serious doctor, the strong independent mature woman, and the quiet legal wife type girl in his harem already, so...</p>
 <p>Or actually, it may be one of them. Who knows?</p>
 <p>So, keep reading and stay tuned for the next chapter of Red Packet Server.</p>
