 <p><span style>Chapter 94 – Another misunderstanding</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thirty minutes later, Ye Zichen stood up with a calm expression, while Di Xinpeng thought back to the results…</span></p>
 <p><span style>From best of five, to best of seven to best of nine…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He kept on adding the number of games, while Ye Zichen has never refused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But he still lost with a terrible defeat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you submit now?” Ye Zichen pursed his lips and smiled as he looked at Di Xinpeng’s sad look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He could feel that this brat was really talented at League of Legends from the solo match just now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was also really good at it, so it wasn’t wrong for Xia Keke to lose to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he chose Ye Zichen as his opponent…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Di Xinpeng truly submitted, he chose all the champions in so many matches. What’s more, these were his best champions. Yet, he could still feel his valley-like difference with Ye Zichen during the games.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other person was so much better than him in both mechanics and knowledge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crushed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He truly submitted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you submit, then do you remember the deal?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone revealed an expression of curiosity. None of them heard what the stakes were when Ye Zichen talked about it with Di Xinpeng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Di Xinpeng nodded, and walked in front of Jing Wan with a long sigh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wan-jie, let’s cancel the contract we signed earlier.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Wan was confused. She looked towards Ye Zichen in shock, while insuppressible anger surfaced on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, I know you’re not confident in my team. You can criticize me for my childishness, but isn’t this too much?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was confused, “What did I do? I’m doing this for your own good though?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“For my good?” Jing Wan laughed manically. “You said it’s for my own good?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, what exactly do you want? It doesn’t matter about Keke, since she’s a girl, so she really might not be suited for professional games, but you aren’t letting my other members go either? I’m telling you, no, I can’t possibly let him go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Wan answered firmly while an insuppressible rage covered her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please leave, you’re not welcomed here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please leave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shrunk his neck and left the mansion with Xia Keke as he looked at Jing Wan’s furious expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Di Xinpeng was confused as well when he saw the two leave. He moved his mouth wanting to say something, but was interrupted by Jing Wan before he could.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Di Xinpeng, didn’t you say you want to play professionally? Didn’t you say that you want to stand on an international stage? You…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wan-jie, you misunderstood,” Di XInpegn sighed. “I want to resign the contract with you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Resign the contract?” Jing Wan didn’t understand, causing her to ask. “What do you mean by resigning the contract?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just now, Ye-ge made the bet with me, if I lose, then I have to stay in your team forever as long as your team can get into the professional league. If your team cannot, then this contract will be invalid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen said that to you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Wan was shocked, she thought that…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then why didn’t you say so earlier?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Wan’s heart became filled with guilt when she thought of her attitude just now. He was clearly thinking for her, and worried about the change in players…</span></p>
 <p><span style>But she…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You didn’t give me the chance to speak,” Di Xinpeng smiled helplessly. “Just now, who would dare to speak when you-you looked like that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Wan felt beyond awkward, she raised her hand and scratched her hair, causing it to turn into a mess, while she bit her lips without saying anything for a long time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was depressed after being suddenly chased out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He clearly did it with Jing Wan in mind, why did she make it seem like she had a huge grudge against him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did Jing Wan-jiejie suddenly get mad?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke looked at the base behind her with a sigh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen licked his lips and replied speechlessly, “Who knows why that woman went crazy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen twitched his mouth towards the mansion behind him. He immediately got annoyed when he thought about the expression Jing Wan had towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke took a glance at Ye Zichen’s expression, then hugged his arm, “Don’t be angry. Oh yeah, you told Di Xinpeng just now that I’m your girlfriend.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Here it comes.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen knew that Xia Keke wasn’t going to let this issue go.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was giving you face just now, you already said that I’m your boyfriend. Just how much face would you lose if I said I’m not. What’s more, it’s not the first time, so you should understand that I’m used to it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk,” Xia Keke frowned in displeasure and snorted. “I don’t want to care about you anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She walked behind the A4 parked on the side, made a face towards Ye Zichen, then disappeared from the mansion area.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen waved towards her, while Liu Qing popped out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Keke seems to like you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No shit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even an idiot could feel that Xia Keke was interested in him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I just want to tell you to manage your relationships properly. From what I knew, this seems to be the third…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing frowned, while Ye Zichen licked his lips and returned home.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the middle of the night.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen scrolled through WeChat as he laid on the bed. For some reason, the group recently turned really cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Less people spoke and nobody sent out red packets anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen scrolled through the moments of several of his deity friends and saw that the people in the Heavenly Court seems to be having some sort of report conference.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Basically, the direct effect for Ye Zichen was that…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn’t get any red packets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s phone vibrated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His heart also shook.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He quickly took a look and saw that the person who sent the message was Su Yan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you asleep?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the first time Su Yan sent him a message after adding her WeChat. However, why did she seek him out so late? Could it be that the goddess can’t sleep and wanted to get him to…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hehehe…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen slapped himself.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Stop f*cking dreaming.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“No, what is it, do you miss me?”&nbsp;</span><span style>Ye Zichen smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Narcissist.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan added several mouth-twitching emojis behind her reply. Ye Zichen could imagine her look at that moment, causing another smile to surface on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s not your first time knowing me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan sent another row of mouth-twitching emojis over, followed by a message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m going to stop messing around. I have proper business with you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Proper business!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn’t you mention that you want to open a supermarket?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I do have this thought.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I got my older brother to look at a few sites for you. Go and take a look if you have time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen did not think that the proper business Su Yan talked about was that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He just casually mentioned it, but Su Yan actually remembered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s heart was moved. It seemed like he wasn’t just a little important to Su Yan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, I’ll go and take a look with Ol’ Three tomorrow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm, its’ getting late. I’m going to sleep.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sent a few cute emojis, then put his phone to the side.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Supermarket!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A supermarket selling to the Heavenly Court…</span></p>
 <p><span style>It’s good, he’ll take the chance of the Heavenly Court being in a conference to set up the supermarket. After they finished, Ye Zichen will advertise his supermarket everywhere…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Cultivation experience!</span></i></p>
