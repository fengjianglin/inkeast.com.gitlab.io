 <p><span style>Chapter 47 – They’re all people with a temper</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Su’s stance even shocked Ye Zichen, who then looked at the people around Elder Su.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>A full guard company!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could Elder Su be a major person in the military?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Doesn’t that mean Su Yan is a powerful third-generation?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The officers that had come to arrest Ye Zichen also stopped. The military and police were two different departments, but they were an entire guard company. More importantly, they also had more people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Captain, are we still arresting him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Officer Lin frowned. No wonder this brat was so cocky, he actually had connections in the military.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If anyone had come this time, then they might truly allow him to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he was unfortunate, and met her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Guard company!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The guard company with several tens of people stood straight. Old Man Su also chuckled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The little fellow over there did it to save me, this old man. Do you understand the rest?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Old Man Su waved and walked to the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Guard company. Everyone, execute the mission!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The several tens of people from the guard company surrounded Officer Lin and the other officers. At the same time, two men holding military rifles stood in front of Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Captain…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Captain what? Arrest him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Officer Lin also got annoyed. Wow, trying to scare her?</span></p>
 <p><span style>She wasn’t the type of person to yield. </span><i><span style>Don’t you want to use force, then let’s try.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll permit you to shoot those who resist. I’ll carry the burden if there’s any issues!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, they stood off against each other, while being completely annoyed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Ye Zichen, who was hearing back felt that all of them are people with a temper. The pitch-black barrels pointed at each other. If anyone misfires...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Doesn’t that make it his responsibility!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>How did it randomly turn into such a huge issue?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen scratched his head and patted the guard company member in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Excuse me, I-I want-want to say a few words.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man looked towards Elder Su. When he saw Elder Su nod, he moved aside to allow Ye Zichen to walk through.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Arrest…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ka!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man behind Ye Zichen instantly raised up the gun. This caused Ye Zichen, who was standing in the middle, feel like his head was about to explode.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck you.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Fight by yourself, why are you raising your guns when laozi is in the middle.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Although I have Unbreakable Body, it can’t stop hot weapons!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Nobody move!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shouted, then ran in front of Old Man Su, then muttered a few words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Ye, this…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old man, I know you are doing this for my good. But the country is promoting the cooperation of police and civilian, we can’t trouble them, right? What’s more, if the news of you, a major person, going against the police with the guard company gets out, it isn’t good for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, but if they trouble you, find me…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After dealing with one side, the situation was much easier to solve. The entire guard company returned to Elder Su’s side with his indication.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen also ran towards Officer Lin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Arrest him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though Ye Zichen solved such a huge problem, Officer Lin did not show a nice expression to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The surrounding officers instantly surrounded Ye Zichen and wanted to put cuffs on him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s this. Let’s not use handcuffs, I won’t be able to run.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen said as he indicated towards Elder Su with his eye for Officer Lin to see. Officer Lin hesitated for a moment, then said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Never mind.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m also coming with you. This started because of me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that Ye Zichen was about to be brought into the police car, Su Yan, who was worried about him, also ran over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Officer Lin glanced at her, then looked at Elder Su’s expression, before raising her eyebrows and saying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bring them away together.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the police car left, on a table outside the barbeque store that wasn’t that far away from the scene.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master, he was taken away, we…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go back and tell Fu Chengming that we aren’t accepting this mission.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man squinted his eyes and finished the glass of beer. The elder opposite him also smiled understandingly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“True, I can tell that Su Qian cares about that young man a lot. There is no need for us to offend the Su family for the Fu family.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man nodded without denying in. At the same time, Ye Zichen’s words surfaced in his mind.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I said that I will break his four limbs. A person has to keep his promise!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“He is an interesting person.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Ye Zichen looked at the familiar interrogation room, he couldn’t help but shake his head and smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was unknown when it had begun, but he gradually became a frequent guest at the police station.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slam.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Officer Lin walked in with a cold expression and slammed the notebook onto the table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait, Officer Lin, why are you so angry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Officer Lin sat on the chair without replying. She lifted her head and scanned Ye Zichen’s body with an interrogative gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Name.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Ye Zichen shook his head and smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t you know what I’m called? You were shouting my name just now at the barbeque store.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t argue with me. You committed a crime, do you understand?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But I helped you out a lot just now, do you understand?” Ye Zichen stood up from the chair, walked in front of the interrogation desk and bent down on it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you know who the old man was just now. If it wasn’t for me, a little police like you fighting against him would end up on the court martial.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stay away from me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Officer Lin lifted her hands and pushed Ye Zichen away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just now, there was only a distance of two centimeters between them. Their noses were even about to touch each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but gaze at her collar, and revealed a naughty smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Officer Lin is truly busty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slam.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Officer Lin slammed the table, while the huge noise shocked Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Woman, what’s with you? Always being so shocking.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Officer Lin’s eyes were filled with coldness as she yelled at Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stay back in your seat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sighed softly, then returned onto his chair. The moment he sat down, Officer Lin spoke up again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Say it, why did you maliciously wound him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How did I maliciously wound him?” Ye Zichen opened his eyes wide in franticness and shouted exaggeratedly. “That grandson insulted my friend first, and even tried to make a move. Can’t I teach him a small lesson?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, you call that a small lesson? You broke his four limbs,” Officer Lin laughed coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t know who that girl is, right? That was Old Man Su’s granddaughter, a true powerful third-generation. Did you not see the guard company? I did it to help him. Otherwise, he would have died.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen acted like he was thinking for the baldie. Hearing that, the corner of Officer Lin’s mouth raised slightly, after which she slammed the table again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop making excuses with me. I’m telling you, no matter what you say, that was malicious wounding. What’s more, you maliciously wounded him in front of me. I won’t just let this go. Also, for someone like you to fall into my hands, it’s your misfortune!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed like Ye Zichen had angered Officer Lin quite a bit, as her sizeable chest heaved up and down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Officer Lin, the way you said it made it sound like you’re picking on me,” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows slightly. Then, he stood up from the chair with a naughty smile and bent down on Officer Lin’s interrogation table again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you interested in me?”</span></p>
