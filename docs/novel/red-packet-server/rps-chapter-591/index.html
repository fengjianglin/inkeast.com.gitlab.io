 <p><span style>Chapter 591 – Come and find me in the Demon Realm if you want to save her</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang had clearly seen how capable Blackie was at influencing others, and Blackie had also made a great chant. While he looked at the souls, he was sure that Blackie could make the ghosts do anything for him with a single sentence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The entirety of the Underworld was rather worried, and they lacked an official with Blackie’s capability.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“An official? I don’t like being an official,” Blackie twitched his mouth. “What’s more, you’ll have to ask my boss before I agree or disagree.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang turned towards Ye Zichen. The latter was still someone he had to treat carefully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master, do you think…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll let him go if you need,” Ye Zichen smiled. It was a good thing for him if Blackie became an official in the Underworld. “But before we worry over that, can we think about now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen noticed that he still didn’t see Gu Li after so long, he already had an idea of what was going on.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He’s messing with me.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Gu Li’s very careful. It’s impossible for him to just be waiting here just because he set this as our meeting point. He might be watching over me somewhere to see if I’ll bring anyone here.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>If Gu Li appears now with King Chujiang and King Pingdeng here, then he’d just be a fool.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Blackie, did you see anyone around here?” Ye Zichen asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not any humans, but I did see a few who seemed like ghost servants from the Underworld,” Blackie raised his eyebrows. “Those ghost servants would come here every half an hour or so to lead a bunch of souls away, then bring them back half an hour later. But all of those souls would have already turned into menacing spirits.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What!?” King Chujiang’s opened his eyes wide. At that very moment, several ghost servants lead a group of menacing spirits over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop right there!” King Pingdeng shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ghost servants immediately wanted to run when they saw King Chujiang and King Pingdeng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang instantly blocked off their path, causing the ghost servants to shiver and kneel down on the floor with a trembling form, without daring to look up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You really are daring!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sire, we had no choice!” The ghost servants replied in abject terror.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang snorted, “Then do tell, just who exactly ordered you to do this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the ghost servants merely looked down at the ground without speaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang immediately frowned, “Speak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sire, actually, it is…” One of the ghost servants wanted to speak, but before he could even utter the name, he immediately imploded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, the other ghost servants also sobbed, “My lord, we can’t say it. If we try to say it, then we’ll die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then do tell this king whether the person instruction you is still inside the valley, and just how many more souls of the deceased are in there!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sire, you definitely wouldn’t be able to see him if you go in now. We only brought these souls out, these and the ones at the entrance to the valley.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“King Pingdeng!” King Chujiang knitted his eyebrows tightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Pingdeng immediately walked over and glanced over at the ghost servants.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Take them back to the Underworld. King Kṣitigarbha might have a way,” King Chujiang nodded with a sullen look, then turned around and cupped his hands towards Ye Zichen. “Master, the situation is rather dire this time. Pingdeng and I have to quickly bring them back to the Underworld to see the bodhisattva. The black-faced man beside you also needs to return with us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright,” Ye Zichen nodded towards Blackie, indicating for the latter to depart with the Yama Kings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Approximately five minutes later, Ye Zichen looked up and snorted. “Come out, I know you’re keeping watch over this place. The Underworld folks have already left, so you should show yourself!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Ye truly understands me,” a meaningful laughter sounded out from the sky. Not long later, Gu Li, who was dressed in a black robe, appeared in front of Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, I didn’t expect you to actually have contact with the people of the Underworld!” Ye Zichen snorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Likewise,” Gu Li smiled. “Doesn’t Brother Ye have contact with them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where’s Su Yan!?” Ye Zichen demanded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re talking about that little beauty? Of course she’s not here,” Gu Li smirked, then glanced at Ye Zichen’s pocket. “I’m no fool. If I brought her over, you’d shatter the jade tablet, then wouldn’t I be screwed?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what do you want?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I didn’t expect him to even know about the jade tablet Su Liu’er gave me. Doesn’t that mean he has spies amongst the fox yaos?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But only Su Liu’er and Su Zhu were there at the time…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But it can’t possibly be either one of them.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop trying to think about it, I naturally have my ways of getting information,” Gu Li smiled. “This test is just to see how sincere you are, but sorry, I’m not satisfied with you at all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then tell me, what exactly do you want?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t be so anxious. It’s very simple, I want your beast flames.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Voom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A ball of flames instantly rose up from Ye Zichen’s palm. The flame itself was bluish, and was swirling with a cold aura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you need it, then I can immediately cut off my link with it and hand it over, but I need to see Su Yan safe and sound.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You truly don’t disappoint, but do you think that you actually have the right to negotiate right now?” Gu Li laughed mockingly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the temperature in the area rocketed down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why do you bullshit with him so much when we can just directly capture him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, Su Liu’er had followed Ye Zichen the entire time, so she had heard most of Ye Zichen and Gu Li’s conversation as well as the ordeal with the Yama Kings. </span><i><span style>So this guy is the one who kidnapped lil’ sis…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“See? How can we have a proper conversation when you’re being followed?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Li’s body suddenly twisted, then eventually disappeared from the valley, leaving only the echo of mocking laughter within.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you really want to save her, then come to my palace in the Demon Realm. Remember, only come by yourself. If anyone else follows, or give you some teleporting item, then don’t think about seeing her ever again. As for how, just go back to the fox yaos, you’ll see there!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Liu’er-jie!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, Ye Zichen was kind of annoyed. </span><i><span style>What should I do if Gu Li does anything to Su Yan because of this!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you throwing a tantrum with me?” The cold aura around Su Liu’er turned colder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know you’re very worried about Su Yan, but my worry is no less than yours, or even a lot more. Su Yan getting in trouble is indeed partially my fault, but I am doing all I can,” Ye Zichen snorted coldly. “You are very powerful, but your emotional intelligence is terrible. Please allow me to take care saving Su Yan, just wait back in your territory for her to return. If you really want to see your little sister safe and sound, then stop adding to the troubles!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen turned around and left.</span></p>

 <p><b>Blackie:&nbsp;</b>Huh?</p>
 <p><strong>King Pingdeng:&nbsp;</strong>We asked you if you would be interested in an official position in the Underworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Blackie:&nbsp;</strong>Yeah, I heard you the first time.</p>
 <p><strong>King Pingdeng:</strong> So, what do you think?</p>
 <p><strong>Blackie:&nbsp;</strong>You gotta ask boss.</p>
 <p><strong>King Pingdeng:&nbsp;</strong>You mean this master right here? (points towards Ye Zichen)</p>
 <p><strong>Blackie:</strong> Yep.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>I think it should be up to you. I'm fine with it either way. Its your future.</p>
 <p><strong>Blackie:&nbsp;</strong>Oh okay. Then does the job include insurances? It should, right? And what does the insurance cover? Oh yeah, how much is the salary? What are the benefits? What are the terms I have to adhere to? DonI have to sign a NDA? Is there…</p>
