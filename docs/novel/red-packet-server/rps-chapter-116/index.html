 <p><span style>Gulp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhuge Kongming’s gulp could be heard in the supermarket that was so quiet that the drop of a needle could be heard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, his childish face was filled with a struggling look, as if he was hesitating whether he should speak out or not.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you wait a bit more, then the cup noodle would taste bad. If you say it now, I can give you an egg as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And a sausage.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhuge Kongming shouted out in anticipation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Deal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This kid might truly be angry. Even Ye Zichen couldn’t stand it anymore when he watched Zhuge Kongming wolf down the food.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>How could he starve like that?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Within three minutes, Zhuge Kongming finished an entire cup of cup noodles, including all the soup, then patted his stomach and burped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen handed over him a bottle of coke, which Zhuge Kongming snatched and gulped down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You ate it all and drink it all, now, let’s tell the truth.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was rather interested in this little fellow’s background.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I-I ran away from home,” Zhuge Kongming frowned his naïve face and said. “My family forced me to learn stuff I don’t like, and even forced me to get engaged to someone I don’t like. There was no helping it, I could only sneak out when they didn’t notice.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed like he’s a child of a rich family.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That made sense. If it wasn’t a rich family, then they definitely wouldn’t be able to afford what he was wearing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then do you think that your family won’t be able to find you by coming here?” Ye Zichen pursed his lips and smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhuge Kongming instantly lifted his head, “They definitely won’t be able to find me, at least not any time soon…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh? Tell me why you’re so confident.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My family is from the capital.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen directly spat out the mouthful of coke he just drank.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked at the little underaged fellow in front of him with shock.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>He really is something.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>This kid is truly wild to run from the capital to Bingcheng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhuge Kongming looked at the coke Ye Zichen spat out in pity, as if he was pitying the wasted coke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a long while, Ye Zichen finally calmed himself down from the shock, put the bottle of coke onto the cash register and squatted in front of Zhuge Kongming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Bro, not bad! You are thorough enough when running away from home!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m alright,” Zhuge Kongming smiled embarrassedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen directly slapped Zhuge Kongming’s head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This kid really thinks that he was being praised!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Such a shitty brat like you isn’t staying at home and going to school, instead running away just like that, to such a far distance, aren’t you afraid of your family worrying?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk, are they caring about me by forcing me do so many things that I don’t like?” Zhuge Kongming lifted his head strongly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen glanced at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was rather pitiful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regardless of it being a political marriage or a business marriage, these children were true sacrifices.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what do you want to do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let me stay here, I can work for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was a bit hesitant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He definitely wouldn’t shoo the kid away. It was already a miracle that the kid could survive from Beijing to Bingcheng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What if something happened if he runs around outside?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen finally decided to allow him to stay after an internal struggle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since he was the child of a rich family, they definitely had the contacts. It was just a matter of time for them to find him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He’ll just get Xiao Hai and Dongfang Wenyi to release the news in the circles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then wait for the child’s parents to come fetch him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s not impossible for you to stay here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big bro, tell me what you want me to do,” Zhuge Kongming’s eyes brightened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just stay in this supermarket from now on. You can stay on the second floor. I’ll buy you a bed tomorrow, so just sleep there. As for our supermarket, we don’t sell to others, do you understand?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We don’t sell?” Zhuge Kongming was a bit confused. What’s the point of a supermarket if they don’t sell anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t think about so much. We’re not selling because I said so. Just stay here properly,” Ye Zichen frowned. This damn brat really has a lot of questions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood, I’ll listen to Big Bro,” Zhuge Kongming nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then sleep here tonight, but you have to put up with it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen directly drove back home after handing the keys to the supermarket to the little fellow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Rong’s life became more lively with Tiantian, and she stopped mentioning any intention of going out to do some sort of work.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he entered the living room, he saw Lil’ Tiantian, Mother Ye and Lil’ White playing happily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re back, Zichen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Daddy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tiantian leaped into Ye Zichen’s arms with a giggle, while Lil’ White also ran over to his side to rub on his leg.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the aid of the Heavenly Court’s dog food, Lil’ White seemed to have grown larger, and his fur seemed to be brighter…</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for anything else…</span></p>
 <p><span style>There didn’t seem to be any changes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sat on the sofa and took out his phone after playing with Tiantian for a while. There were still no news of the deities, causing him to get a bit depressed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Xia Keke and Su Yan sent him quite a few messages.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of them were just asking him if he got the concert tickets yet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen thought about it a bit, then replied to Su Yan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Got the tickets.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Buzz…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later after the message of sent, Su Yan called him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is what you said true?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wasn’t it just concert tickets? Was there a need for such a huge reaction!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Keke, Ye Zichen said he got the concert tickets.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Keke…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A huge noise sounded out from the other side of the call. Ye Zichen’s heart trembled and quickly asked, “Are you alright?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ouch, it hurts so much…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke complaint sounded out from the phone. Then not long later, tiny noises rang out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Riche Bro, you said you got the tickets, are they infield tickets?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah!” Ye Zichen was instantly speechless. However, thinking about the loud bang earlier, he couldn’t help but comfort here. “Are you alright?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m fine, I’m fine, I just fell down!” Xia Keke said as she gasped. “I’ll go to you for the tickets tomorrow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slam.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The call ended.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was truly worried about her hurting herself as he listened to the busy beep of the phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing also floated out and said worriedly, “Is Keke alright?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She should be,” Ye Zichen answered vaguely. Then, he quickly looked up strangely and eyed Liu Qing playfully. “Didn’t you say you’re going to ignore me? Why did you come out again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk, this lady just came out for some fresh air.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She entered into the Dragon Eye once again.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This ghost girl was really cute.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but shake his head with a chuckle. At the same time, his phone also rang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>WeChat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s shoulders shook, and saw that the Third Prince Nezha spoke up in the spokespeople group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great deity, great deity, are you there! Someone wants to buy treasures from you!”</span></p>
