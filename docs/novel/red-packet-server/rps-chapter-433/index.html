 <p><span style>Chapter 433 – Abyssals in the Modern Realm</span></p>
 <p><span style>The falling snow dressed the ground in a snow-white veil. When one takes a look at the streets, all they would see is whiteness everywhere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the people on the streets wore thick clothes, and even Ye Zichen wore a cold-resistant clothes, but the old man beside him…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He seemed to be over fifty years old, and had hair and a beard that shared the color with the snow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, what shocked people was that the old man only wore a set of… &nbsp;thin clothes with no jacket or anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh… I didn’t think that the place abandoned by the Heavenly Court back then has already developed to this degree. This is truly astonishing!” Taibai Jinxing exclaimed as he looked at the tall standing buildings and never-ending stream of people. “Before this land was abandoned, this was my favorite place. I liked the snow here, and it seemed very beautiful…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old man, stop reminiscing. Say, what do you plan to do after descending?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What can I plan?” Taibai Jinxing raised his eyebrows. “I naturally came here to come to you. Right now, I have less than ten percent of my strength that I still had when in my celestial position, so I only have the strength of a mid-stage Human Immortal at best… Oh yeah, give me back the cultivation I gave you earlier,” Taibai Jinxing as he took out his phone and waited for Ye Zichen to send a red packet.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wait…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Did I hear it wrong?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>This geezer was asking me for cultivation experience!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at him in shock. </span><i><span style>Wasn’t this cultivation experience for me? Why does he want it back?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you looking at me like that? Send me… the cultivation experience,” Taibai Jinxing waved his phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately frowned, “Wasn’t the cultivation experience a gift to me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing instantly raised his eyebrows speechlessly, “Are you kidding me? That’s ten billion cultivation experience. For you...? Do you really think that I’m an old fool?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This comment truly caught Ye Zichen off guard. </span><i><span style>I already spent a lot of the cultivation experience and now this geezer is asking me to give it back.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I thought that I had turned into a riche person just now, f*ck…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>So, I was merely a delivery man.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Send it!” Taibai Jinxing frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen coughed, then scratched his head, “Check to see if you can get onto the net?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s so hard… Ai, I really can’t connect,” Taibai Jinxing was stunned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then just figure this network problem out. I’ll send it over to you when you figure it out. Otherwise, even if I send it, you wouldn’t be able to receive it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen already predicted that Taibai Jinxing would be unable to connect to the network. When Erlang Yang Jian descended, he was unable to connect. It really could be able to, then that would be far too weird.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>If he can’t connect for this entire life, then the cultivation experience would stay with me for an entire life.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Then… the cultivation experience would be mine!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Before Ye Zichen even fantasized enough, Taibai Jinxing suddenly spoke up. “Alright now, since I’m connected now, send the cultivation experience over to me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nearly coughed up a mouthful of blood. He immediately snatched Taibai Jinxing’s phone over and checked the connection.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck, 4G!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the hell? How did this geezer’s phone connect to the Modern Realm’s 4G network?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“How did you do this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I felt that there was a network nearby, so I changed the code, and got connected. I set up the Heavenly Court’s network, so stealing internet here’s easy!” Taibai Jinxing smiled, then pointed at his WeChat. “I logged on, so send the cultivation experience over to me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehehe… Don’t even think about that!” Ye Zichen gripped his phone tightly. “It has never been possible to get something back from laozi’s hands.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little friend, what do you mean by this!?” Taibai Jinxing smiled faintly and said in a slightly threatening tone. “Are you trying to tell me that this old man won’t be able to get that ten billion cultivation experience back?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!” Ye Zichen answered shamelessly, then squinted his eyes. “Xuan-Yuan!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aiya, what is it? I was just taking a shower,” Xuan-Yuan Xiang appeared in front of Ye Zichen in bathrobe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing showed a shocked expression when he saw her.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>A divine artifact’s artifact spirit!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Little friend, do you think that you can steal this old man’s treasures after gaining a divine artifact? Although this old man discarded my celestial position, my strength is not something you can match up to,” Taibai Jinxing snorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen merely smiled, “Tenner!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>No response.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This little guy, who would come out whenever I call him, actually didn’t come out.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Tenner!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shout shouting, that little fellow is easily submerged when he starts to play with toy blocks,” Xuan-Yuan Xiang stretched lazily. Then, the bathrobe on her body became normal clothes. “If you want to fight, then I’m enough… Hey, geezer, don’t try to bully my little brother in front of me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A lotus mark begun to appear in between Xuan-Yuan Xiang’s eyebrows and glowed, while the Xuan-Yuan Sword, which rested in Ye Zichen’s arm, also flew to Xuan-Yuan Xiang’s hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haaaaa….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A purple wave of demonic energy suddenly appeared in front of everyone’s gaze, while they heard a familiar sound of exhalation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen turned around and looked over. Several slimy monsters actually appeared. “Xuan-Yuan!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I noticed already!” Xuan-Yuan Xiang raised his eyebrows, then sent two rays of sword energy over, turning the monsters instantly into mist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This…” Taibai Jinxing no longer thought about his cultivation experience. “Basic abyssals!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing was extremely familiar with those monsters after fighting for demons for such a long time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, Ye Zichen nodded, then knitted his eyebrows with a snort. “These guys actually crawled out!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How did they enter the Modern Realm!?” Taibai Jinxing frowned in confusion. “Doesn’t the Modern Realm have a self-protecting method? Shouldn’t they be in an alternate world?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They were in the Otherworld, but… these guys bite the barrier open!” Ye Zichen replied with a frown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xuan-Yuan Xiang also knitted her eyebrows tightly together, “Stop wasting time. Hurry up and go in to kill all of them, otherwise…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, several spatial cracks appeared, and slimy monsters oozed out from within.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shing, shing, shing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xuan-Yuan Xiang continuously waved the sword and killed the demonic beings, while Ye Zichen also frowned, “Someone must guard this place. Stay here, and directly kill any demonic beings that comes out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what about you? I’m worried when I’m not there protecting you!” Xuan-Yuan Xiang frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked towards her with a comforting gaze, “Stop worrying, I’ll be fine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, he took out the Otherworld Pass from his Treasure Chest…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gate to the Otherworld, open!”</span></p>
