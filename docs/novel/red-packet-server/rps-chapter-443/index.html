 <p><i><span style>Scar?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wei Chen!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>If he’s talking about the people who went to the Otherworld, then only Wei Chen had a scar on his face, but why is Taibai Jinxing mentioning him? He’s not particularly strong.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Kid, it seems like you don’t know everything, right?” Taibai Jinxing smiled, then raised his eyebrows. “That scar-faced man is the Body Double of the White Tiger of the Four Sacred Beasts.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you sure?” Ye Zichen looked at him in surprise…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wei Chen is the White Tiger?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Although Ye Zichen had once suspected Wei Chen of his identity, he never considered the possibility of that guy being the White Tiger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is still a lot that you don’t know. Hurry up and call him over, I have some very important things to discuss with him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Approximately half an hour later, Wei Chen appeared in the apartment in silver clothing. The moment he entered the door, he nodded towards Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Ye, why did you call me so urgently for? I was leading those little fellows and repairing the torn spatial barrier,” a hint of fatigue could be seen from Wei Chen’s eyes. He had been on the front line of the battle with the demons for a long time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He would take the people over to the scene the moment he caught wind of everything. Furthermore, it wasn’t only him, all of the members of Tribulation were extremely tired.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve troubled you. I’ll lead the team to repair the holes later. You just stay here and rest for a while. Taibai has something he wants to discuss with you as well,” Ye Zichen patted Wei Chen’s shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wei Chen took a glance over at Taibai Jinxing, then his pupils instantly contracted as he shook his head, “Boss Ye, that sort of place is too dangerous…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t talk about danger. I won’t be in any danger with the Xuan-Yuan Sword by my side,” Ye Zichen pressed Wei Chen onto the sofa, then picked up his jacket from the sofa and put it on. “Do chat, I’m going over to the scene.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Ye Zichen directly left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, a sharp light also flashed across Wei Chen’s eyes as he stared at Taibai Jinxing, “Taibai Jinxing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“White Tiger?” Taibai Jinxing also looked towards Wei Chen with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Wei Chen instantly shrugged, “Alright, since we know each other’s identity, then speak. What business do you have with this sovereign!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wei Chen took out a cigarette from his pocket, put it into his mouth, then raised his hand and repeatedly massaged his temples, as he occasional puffed out smoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Simply said, this old man merely wants to ask, I wonder if you can get your Main Body to descend upon the Modern Realm?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ahem…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wei Chen, who was smoking, suddenly coughed intensely. After a while, when he finally stopped coughing, he put the cigarette out in the ashtray and shook his head, “No!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why?” Taibai Jinxing’s face stiffened. He had thought that since the White Dragon’s Body Double was fighting here, he was willing to help with eradicating the demons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, then this Sovereign will tell you the truth, but you cannot tell anything to Ye Zichen. Do you understand?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wei Chen mumbled a few words, causing Taibai Jinxing’s eyes to instantly open wide as he exclaimed, “How’s that possible!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Time passed by in the blink of an eye. After a few more days of rest, Su Yan’s body had completely recovered. Logically speaking, it was impossible for her to recover so quickly, and even the doctors at the hospital were completely shocked when they saw the reports.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everything was fine, and the wounds on her body had also healed completely without even leaving behind a single tiny scar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was already something that could not be explained with logic….</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Su Yan was discharged, all of her friends and roommates all went to see her… except Sun Yige.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems like we haven’t seen Sun Yige for a long time,” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke nodded, “Yeah, ever since that event at our school, we haven’t seen Sun Yige anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Due to the serial murder and the disappearance of various students at Polytechnic University, the school had already been stopped temporarily, and all of the students were on a long holiday!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She might be out to travel,” Liu Qianqian said. “I went over to her family’s store earlier, and it was closed as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Possibly,” Xia Keke muttered. “But that bad guy, she actually didn’t bring us along to travel, nor has she replied when I called out to her in the group chat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey… Didn’t you guys come to get me since I’m discharged? Why do I feel like I’m not the main character?”” Su Yan smiled. Since her body had completely recovered, she was already no different from a normal person. However, Ye Zichen suddenly felt that she seemed even more mesmerizing after the situation…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you looking at me like that,” Su Yan blushed slightly after noticing Ye Zichen’s gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cuz you’re pretty,” Ye Zichen did not hold back his praise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As they chatted happily, the Su family arrived.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The one in the lead was naturally Su Qihu, who held a stern expression, while Su Qilong and Old Man Su followed behind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Su Yan saw Su Qihu, she couldn’t help but think about her older brother Su Yiyun…</span></p>
 <p><span style>That situation, that cold gaze, and those heart-breaking words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She bit her lips softly. At the same time, Old Man Su also walked over. He nodded towards Yey ZIchen and co. then held Su Yan’s hand softly with a smile, “My darling granddaughter has suffered a lot. C’mon, come back home with grandpa.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to go with them…” Su Yan pointed to the people beside her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Man Su instantly shook his head, “No, come back with us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Previously Old Man Su would never put on that sort of expression towards Su Yan, and when Ye Zichen’s there, he would always push her towards Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the fact that the old man directly refused without any space for negotiation caused Su Yan to be rather shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandpa…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Be a good girl, and come back with grandpa. Or do you want grandpa to get angry?” Old Man Su’s kind face instantly turned solemn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan bit her lips and still did not want to go with them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Su Yan, go back with Elder Su. You just got discharged, so you need to rest at home,” Ye Zichen smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since Lil’ Ye said that as well, come,” Old Man Su dragged Su Yan away by her arm, while Su Qihu and Su Qilong also followed and left the room side by side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they finally left from side, Xia Keke blinked and muttered, “So strange.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is strange,” Ye Zichen had never seen Old Man Su like that either, but since he chose to do that, Ye Zichen felt like he must have had his own reasons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye ZIchen patted Xia Keke’s head, then looked at the two girls with a smile, “What are you guys going to do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I need to continue my internship at the hospital,” Liu Qianqian shrugged sadly. “Grandpa just texted me and told me not to run around…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then just stay in the hospital. You do need to learn properly from Elder Deng with your skills.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk, none of your business,” Liu QIanqian stomped her foot angrily, then left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled when he saw her leave, then looked towards Xia Keke…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t look at me, I’m just going to follow you.”</span></p>
