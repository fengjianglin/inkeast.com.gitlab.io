 <p><span style>Chapter 271 – Sun Yige’s Drastic Change</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen looked back at Yue Lao’s chat after putting away the red strings, he saw that the old man had exploded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn’t help but smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you getting anxious for!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How could I not be anxious!” Yue Lao thought to himself. </span><i><span style>It’s not like you’re the one who might lose his year end bonus…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Never mind, since you gave me those red strings, then this sovereign will give you a few tips,” Ye Zichen replied with a smile. “You can make a dating game show for the Heavenly Court!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dating game show?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao was confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Find twenty six marriage-thirsty girls, essentially just female deities that want to get married. Then find some good quality lads and give them a platform to get to know each other so that they’ll become a couple. After that, they can leave. Whenever there’s an empty spot for the girls, find someone else to fill up the spot etc…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was definitely able to talk about several tens of different non-repetitive ideas when it came to dating game shows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since there were so many of them in the Modern World, he naturally understood a bit from just hearing about them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uhm… Are you sure it’ll work?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao didn’t quite believe him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but retort when he saw Yue Lao’s doubts.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He actually did not trust “If You are the One” that is famous throughout the whole world. The popularity of this dating game show…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s definitely alright. I’m telling you, if you do just that, you’ll definitely get a share of the year end bonus. What’s more, as Yue Lao, if it really doesn’t work, then do some tricks behind their backs!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, I’ll try it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m telling you, if this game show gets high ratings in the Heavenly Court, do give me some commission!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen left the chat with Yue Lao and decided to stare at the red strings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was able to link strings, but that was only when he could see them…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I can’t exactly go over to Ganshui Road just to help them tie some strings, right…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, Ye Zichen remembered the Thousand Li Tracking Sigil from All Seeing Eye…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He immediately sent a friend request.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I have accepted your friend request. Let’s chat!</span></p>
 <p><span style>All Seeing Eye: Sky Sovereign!</span></p>
 <p><span style>All Seeing Eye spoke with a hint of seriousness. Sky Sovereign was not a title that anyone could bare. This deity dared to address himself as “this sovereign”, while the other deities in the group also called him “Sky Sovereign”…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although they have never met before, All Seeing Eye did not dare to offend him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All Seeing Eye: I wonder what business do you have with this little deity?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen glanced at the intimacy level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Friendly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I wonder if daoist friend still has any Thousand Li Tracking Sigils left?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All Seeing Eye was surprised.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That kind of crappy thing was things he randomly made for fun when he had nothing better to do. If he actually wanted to, he could provide him with a whole truckload of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I wonder if daoist friend can send this sovereign a few?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received All Seeing Eye’s red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thousand Li Tracking Sigil x50.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but rub his eyes when he saw the amount… </span><i><span style>There was no mistake. It was fifty!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“If Sky Sovereign needs anymore, then you can ask little deity for them any time.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Was it that worthless?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at the message on his phone in shock. </span><i><span style>I had thought that the sigil was some sort of amazing treasure.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, thank you daoist friend.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign is too courteous. If there are no other matters, then little deity is going off to patrol.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen took out a sigil from the Treasure Chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Would you like to use Thousand Li Tracking Sigil?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Note: Thousand-Li Tracking Sigil is a consumable item. It locates the target for three hours.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Please select the target. It is limited to a person or item that you have seen before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen imagined the Ganshui Road brothers in his mind. Not long later, a scene appeared in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Ganshui Road Brothers kneeled on the floor in a line with terrified expressions as they continuously prostrated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sounds of bottles breaking could occasionally be heard from behind them.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It seems like Big Brother Ox-Head called some ghosts over.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen licked his lips and smiled evilly.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The Ganshui Road Brothers’ bonds are truly strong!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Also, since that trap liked being a girl so much… Then I’ll let him feel a man’s passion.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen quickly tied the red strings for them and revealed a satisfied smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I wish the five of you a happy life!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment he said that, Ye Zichen could see from the image that…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Four of the five Ganshui Road Brothers, who were kneeling in a line, instantly sat their gaze on the trap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The buzz cut brother kneeled on the floor with a knee and grabbed the trap’s hand with his right hand…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Flower, I have fallen in love with you. Be my man!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the scar-faced brother kicked the buzz cut brother away and cursed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck off, Flower, I’m the one who loves you the most!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All of you f*ck off. Flower, it’s me who loves you the most!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Flower!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ding dang dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Ganshui Road Brothers immediately started to fight amongst themselves, causing Ye Zichen to be unable to resist his laughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you smiling so lecherously?” Zhang Rui pushed Ye Zichen a bit. “Hurry up, we have lessons later!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, we might be able to see huge news in tomorrow’s headlines!” Ye Zichen chuckled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he finished the entire day of class, Ye Zichen was rather surprised that Class Rep Sun did not attend class.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From what he could recall, that class rep of his never missed any lessons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>To no surprise, Lu Lu immediately stuck to him when lessons were finished. However, what caused him to feel even more troubled was that…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan and Xia Keke were also outside the classroom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“School Beauty Harvester, as expected of your name!” Xia Keke twitched her mouth meaningfully, while Su Yan looked straight at Lu Lu with the gaze of the legal wife…</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, the smell of gunpowder was everywhere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahem… Errr, have you seen Sun Yige?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re still thinking of Sun Yige…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They instantly exploded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We didn’t see Yige today,” Xia Keke and Su Yan finally replied after sorting out their moods. “She did not return to the dorms yesterday.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How many times have I told you? I’m not your Sis. If you guys dare to harass me one more time, then don’t blame me for being merciless,” A yell could be heard from the school woods.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately frowned when he heard this familiar voice as he hurried towards the woods…</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he arrived in the woods, he saw a tall girl who wore black skintight leather clothes and black high heels.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If she had a whip in her hands with this outfit…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cough cough!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked in front of the girl and saw three delinquents lying there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He took a closer look and saw that these three delinquents were Wei Teng’s underlings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen connected the dots, then ran in front of the girl in disbelief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sun-Sun Yige,” Ye Zichen gulped. </span><i><span style>What’s going on?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>This Sun Yige is totally a different person from the Sun Yige I know!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Sun Yige has always been like a little sister next door, who caused people to be unable to resist caring for her. But this lady in front of me…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Had her hair tied up in a bun, drew long and thin eyeliner, had bright red lips as well as a gaze that looked down on the world…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>She isn’t that little sister next door at all!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>She is a queen!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Are-Are you Sun Yige?”</span></p>
