 <p><span style><span>Chapter 265 – The Five Pengci Brothers<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p><span style>Near the Ganshui Road development area…</span></p>
 <p><span style>A twenty-five or twenty-six year old man laid in front of a white Audi A6, while four young men around his age stood around him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pengci.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And it was an organized pengci.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Plenty of the surrounding bystanders shook their heads. These young men were frequent scammers in this area.</span></p>
 <p><span style>People called them the Ganshui Road Pengci Brothers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This pengci group always picked on targets that were rather easy to bullied. Most people that ran into these situations would pay up to escape the trouble, so when they saw that the car’s occupants were actually two young girls…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It seems like the Ganshui Road Pengci Brothers were going to succeed again.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Girl, you bumped into my bro’s leg, compensate!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, you guys are really shameless!” Xia Keke pouted, while she looked ahead speechlessly. “We drove very slowly, so it was impossible to crash into anyone. If you guys really think that we crashed into him, then fine, we’ll go to the hospital. If something really happened, then we definitely won’t run.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We brothers are busy, how could we have time to go to the hospital? Don’t bullshit with us, compensate us with five thousand yuan and we’ll call it even.” The more menacing looking man out of the five roared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, a kind-looking young man added, “Girl, there is no need for you to mind them. Five thousand yuan, just treat it as preventing trouble!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually the person who spoke was also part the group since their pengci group was very well organized.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One of them would be the “victim”, while the other people would perform other tasks. They might pretend to be a bystander, or a worked-up teenager that helps the “victim”, or the big bro of the “victim” that asks for money…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Basically, it was teamwork.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why should I give him money? We didn’t hit him,” Xia Keke bit her lip and snorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, a Panamera stopped, and Ye Zichen got off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen-ge!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan and Xia Keke both walked up to him, while the Ganshui brothers looked at Ye Zichen’s car.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A well-equipped Panamera cost nearly two million. Looking at his age, </span><i><span style>he should be a rich second generation.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, they felt a bit troubled. Professional scanners like them really disliked dealing with rich second generations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While the scammers started to think about retreating, Ye Zichen nodded towards the two girls and walked in front of the scammers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You got hit by their car?” Ye Zichen squatted on the ground and glanced at the scammer, who was lying in front of the car and moaning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ouch…” The scammer cried out in “pain” due to not knowing the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The menacing-looking young man frowned, then snorted, “What is your relationship with them? I’m telling you, these two girls hit my little brother.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm, then how much do you want to be compensated for?” Ye Zichen smiled faintly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The scammers were stunned. They never would have imagined that the rich second generation would be that easy to talk to. They, who were going to retreat, glanced at his car, while the menacing-looking man held out a finger…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How much is that?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ten thousand!” The menacing looking hulk squinted. “Give us ten thousand, then this is over!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, why did the five thousand from earlier become ten thousand!?” Xia Keke frowned. “Zichen-ge, we didn’t hit him. They are here to pengci.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rubbed Xia Keke’s hair, then squinted his eyes. “So little. Since I can drive that car, don’t you feel like you’re at a loss to just ask ten thousand yuan from me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gulp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pengci group gulped.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Were they going to turn everything around and suddenly become rich?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“How much do you want to give?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe…” Ye Zichen squinted his eyes, walked in front of Su Yan and asked her from the car keys. At the same time, he also called Bai Dahai. “Fatty, I met some pengci scammers, wire a million to my account. I’m going to crush him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Ye Zichen hung up and got in the car.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the young man on the ground heard the engine start up, he frantically stood up and cursed, “Grandson, do you want to crush me to death!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh wow, didn’t you get hit by the car? I don’t see anything wrong with you?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows. “I even got the money transferred over. I can’t exactly just leave it lying around, right? Stand still, I’ll crush you to death now then give you guys the money!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stepped down on the pedal, and the Audi A6 sped out towards the young man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man immediately jumped to the side and dodged it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Ye Zichen also stopped the car, pointed towards the pengci scammers and cursed, “If you don’t want to die, then scram!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, the Ganshui Brothers scrambled off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Su Yan and Xia Keke also walked up to Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You scared me so much. I thought that you were really going to crush him,” Su Yan called out with a frown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you think I’m an idiot? If I ended up killing him, then I have to pay up with my life! I was just scaring him!’ Ye Zichen reached out to rub Su Yan’s and Xia Keke’s heads. “Why did you girls come over to the Ganshui Road development area?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe…” Xia Keke suddenly got closer mysteriously. “There is a very accurate fortune telling place here. Susu and I came to get our fortunes told!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Fortune telling place?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows. </span><i><span style>Weren’t these kinds of things all lies!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but shake his head when he saw Su Yan’s and Xia Keke’s anticipatory look.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It can only trick young girls like them.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen and co. drove over to the business street around there. Since the area was still in development, there weren’t many shops there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fortune telling place Xia Keke and Su Yan wanted to visit was a store. It didn’t seem too big from the outside, but within…</span></p>
 <p><span style>They saw that the room was pitch dark the moment they entered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Puff.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The candles on both sides of the pitch-dark corridor suddenly lit up after they took a few steps.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck, what the hell!?” Ye Zichen looked at the scene in shock. </span><i><span style>This was too strange…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“We heard that this fortune telling place is very mysterious from our classmate. It really is amazing!” Xia Keke patted her hands in excitement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Su Yan’s eyes also lit up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The more mysterious the fortune telling place seemed, the more hopes they had for the fortune teller.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After they walked two or three minutes down the candlelit corridor, Ye Zichen and co. arrived outside the room of the fortuneteller.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen-ge, do you want to go in with us?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, I’m not interested in this stuff,” Ye Zichen shook his head as he looked around vigilantly. No matter what, he just felt that the place seemed slightly sinister…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then we’re going!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two girls held hand and tried to push open the door to the fortuneteller. However, for some reason, no matter how they pushed, the door just would not bulge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop wasting your strength. The fortuneteller only tells the fortune of destined people. Since you can’t push open this door, it means that we are not destined to meet,” An empty laugh sounded out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What a pity!” Xia Keke and Su Yan frowned unhappily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who sat back on a chair, squinted his eyes, and pushed the door…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The door… Opened!</span></p>
