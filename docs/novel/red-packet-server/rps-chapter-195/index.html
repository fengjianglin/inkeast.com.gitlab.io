 <p><span style>Chapter 195 – Yu’s assassination</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Gu?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows at the old man on the bed in confusion…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Did this old man also treat him as someone from that place? </span><i><span style>But the Gu family isn’t the only family there, right?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Just from his recent understanding, Di Tian was also someone from that place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen licked his lips and shrugged with a smile, “This brat’s surname is not Gu, it’s Ye, Ye Zichen!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Man Lin was clearly stunned for a moment when he heard Ye Zichen’s reply. From the looks of it, Ye Zichen’s reply was not what he expected…</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Old Man Lin immediately revealed a faint smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then this old man might have recognized wrongly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded towards Old Man Lin with a smile, then walked out from the bedroom after reminding the old man to take it easy as he was still recovering.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the entrance to Old Man Lin’s room…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone in the Lin family was gathered and paced worriedly. The instant that the door opened, everyone instantly surrounded Ye Zichen…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mr. Ye…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, how’s my grandpa?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ru was the one who had a better relationship with Ye Zichen, so she didn’t mind directly asking him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn’t disappoint,” Ye Zichen smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A hint of joy instantly appeared in Lin Ru’s eyes, causing her to hug his neck and kiss him on the cheek.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m going to see grandpa.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen subconsciously looked towards Wu Haoyu…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Say, bro, this isn’t…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Haoyu patted his shoulder with a laugh, “Lil’ Ru is happy, I understand that! I’m a man, otherwise, I would have smooched you on the cheek too. Do you even know how important it is to them for Old Man Lin to wake up…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Hanben nodded excitedly on the side, while many of his relatives rushed in the bedroom to see the old man…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually Lin Hanben wanted to as well, but thinking about the fact that Ye Zichen was still there, he chose to stay here!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After this incident, he was truly beyond thankful towards Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mr. Ye…” Lin Hanben spoke up after hesitating for a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sighed, although he was rather annoyed by this uncle, when he saw this uncle now, he didn’t have the heart to do things too outrageously…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go see the old man, no need to say any words of thanks.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Erm…” Lin Hanben clenched his teeth and took out a cheque from his pocket that he respectfully handed to Ye Zichen. “Mr. Ye, I’m not sure about how to thank you… So please take this money as the medical fees…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen glanced at the number on it…</span></p>
 <p><span style>So many zeros.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen thought about it, and after realizing that he wasn’t desperately lacking money, he shrugged with a smile and pushed the cheque back, “If you are sincere, then help me donate it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Ye Zichen refused Lin Hanben’s offer for him to stay in a roundabout manner, Ye Zichen slowly wandered onto the streets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Man Lin’s situation with his meridians definitely wasn’t due to a sickness, he might have met some sort of expert, and got beaten up, ending up like that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, what made Ye Zichen more curious was why he had asked whether Ye Zichen’s surname was Gu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Recently, he would always hear about the Gu family…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing knows Grandpa Gu, and there was also the Gu Tian with low EQ!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Gu family…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen murmured softly, then suddenly felt a chill on his back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A huge noise sounded out. When Ye Zichen turned his head back, he saw the corner of Yu’s mouth being bloodied, while an azure pearl levitated on top of him. At the same time, the Hou brothers who were protecting Ye Zichen in secret had also suddenly blocked in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Soul Pearl Yiyuan…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Didn’t this thingy go into his head? </span><i><span style>Why did it come out again?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, when he saw the dagger shining with a deadly light in Yu’s hand, Ye Zichen’s heart beat raced…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>These monkeys that the Great Sage left behind are not too reliable. If it wasn’t for Soul Pearl Yiyuan saving me in time, I might have just died.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You two, your Wahaha for the week is halved!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen frowned, then after rolling his eyes at the Hou brothers, he hooked his fingers towards Soul Pearl Yiyuan, then maintained at a suitable distance from Yu, “Bro, let’s go by the rules. I’m on the streets right now, is it really good for you to make a move on me like that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu’s eyes were bloodshot, but he didn’t reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, he threw the dagger in his hand towards Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soul Pearl Yiyuan, that had returned to swirl around Ye Zichen deflected the dagger, then instantly sped towards Yu’s head…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu wanted to dodge, but he could feel the Hou brothers lock onto him…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>They were also of the Spiritual Body level!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He gave up!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yiyuan, stop!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the very moment that Soul Pearl Yiyuan was about to hit Yu’s head, Soul Pearl Yiyuan came to an emergency stop. Then, it moved backwards a little as if it was asking Ye Zichen why he didn’t let it attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You little thing, this is a f*cking lawful society. Killing is illegal, do you understand?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen slapped Soul Pearl Yiyuan, and grasped it within his hand. Then, Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows at a distance of approximately three meters away from Yu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have lost, kill me,” Yu turned his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen glanced to the side.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It was fortunate that there was a lack of people using the road, otherwise the two of them would definitely end up on the evening news!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sighed silently, then sat on the edge of a flowerbed three meters away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, he squinted his eyes and shrugged, “Bro, don’t always talk about killing and stuff. This is different from the place you live, we have to go by the laws here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that Yu didn’t reply, Ye Zichen scratched his head, “I can tell that you got hurt quite a bit by my treasure, how about I call an ambulance for you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just kill me,” There was a bit of tremble in Yu’s voice. “I have failed again…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the dagger that was parried to the side by Soul Pearl Yiyuan struggled up from the ground and flew back to Yu’s side, then continuously swirled around him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry, old friend, I lost.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dagger shook left and right humanly, then tried to get back into Yu’s hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I lost, so be it. The current us cannot match them,” Yu murmured apathetically. He was just of the Spiritual Body level, the other person had both bodyguards of the Spiritual Body level and a spiritual treasure protecting him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He had no more chances.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen squinted his eyes, then slowly walked towards Yu. When Ye Zichen got close to him, the dagger flew out as if it was protecting Yu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Soul Pearl Yiyuan, which was in Ye Zichen’s hand and crashed into the blade with a ring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, you want to kill me that much?” Ye Zichen was truly confused by Yu’s muttering…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the hell!?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why does he want to kill me so much?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, we don’t see to have any grudges between us, right?” Ye Zichen was a bit speechless. “Why do you have to kill me? How did I piss you off?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We have no grudges between us, but I have to kill you,” a hint of helplessness was mixed in Yu’s voice, causing Ye Zichen to scratch his head…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Seriously… Do you not even have a motive for killing me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t want to waste my breath with you, go ahead and kill me…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How many times did I tell you? This is a lawful society, I have to go to jail if I kill you. There is a great old saying, dying nicely is not as good as grabbing hold of life. Why do you always want to die? Is dying the only thing in your dictionary?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, Ye Zichen saw Yu’s depressed look…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you in some sort of trouble? Tell me about it, I might be able to help you.”</span></p>
