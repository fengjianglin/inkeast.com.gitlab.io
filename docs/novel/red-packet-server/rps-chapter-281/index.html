 <p><span style>Chapter 281 – Equipment!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen hesitated to give a reply as he saw Yang Jian’s retort.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had seen the Great Sage before. In terms of appearance, Erlang Shen, Yang Jian, was definitely above the Great Sage by a bit. However, in terms of position, that’s a completely different story.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the Victorious Fighting Buddha of the Buddhist Region, no one in the Heavenly Court dared to bully Great Sage Sun, and he has even beaten up the Jade Emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand… to be frank, Erlang Shen was just the head of security in the Heavenly Court. There were all too many people that could manage him, making the difference between the two apparent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, no need to mind so much about those common girls so much. Take it easy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, all Ye Zichen could do was comfort his bro’s damaged heart a little.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s it, I have to go and fight with the monkey. Bro, wait for my triumphant return.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen glanced at the messages in the group. The two seemed to have decided on the location of the duel, making it seem like they were truly going to fight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To be honest, Ye Zichen did not have that much confidence in Yang Jian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Great Sage and Erlang Shen had fought before, but the monkey seemed to have always won.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shook his head with a soft smile. Then, he suddenly realized that Erlang Shen, the final male guest, had failed to get a girl as well... </span><i><span style>Doesn’t that mean that no one succeeded?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Thinking that, Ye Zichen couldn’t help but sent Yue Lao a message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yue Lao, how are the reactions to the show?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Yue Lao was definitely extremely happy. The Jade Emperor had just rewarded him, and plenty of families in the Heavenly Court sought him out continuously for a private chat, wishing to get their family’s children on the show…</span></p>
 <p><span style>During those, he would receive many red packets. In merely four hours’ time, Yue Lao had already received several hundred thousands in cultivation experience and gold ingots.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As his phone rang, Yue Lao, who was smoking leisurely, thought that it was just a deity that wanted a spot on the next dating show, but when he saw that it was actually Ye Zichen, he instantly put out his cigarette and stopped looking so carefree.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, the reactions to the show is rather good. The Jade Emperor just rewarded me. Here is a sign of my goodwill, please accept it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A red packet appeared on the screen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows and collected it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received Yue Lao’s red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cultivation experience x100000.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gold Ingots x50.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thousand-year wild ginseng x5.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Worldly Daoist Robe x1.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s an equipment drop!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately raised his eyebrows. He had worked so hard for all sorts of missions before, it was his first time getting any equipment out of it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He forcefully suppressed his excitement and sent Yue Lao a message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This daoist robe…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is just a bit of goodwill from this little deity. It isn’t much use for Sky Sovereign, but it might be of use for Sky Sovereign’s family or friends.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In Yue Lao’s heart, Ye Zichen’s cultivation level was already through the roof, so he naturally didn’t need the daoist robe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Worldly Daoist Robe: A new daoist robe produced in 2016 from the Heavenly Court. It is woven by the Weaver Girl using heavenly silk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Effects: Increases the purity of the wearer’s celestial spiritual energy.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Something made by the Weaver Girl</span></i><span style><span><a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></span></span><i><span style> is definitely excellent!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately took the daoist robe out and put it on without thinking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were something that was different from what Ye Zichen imagined. The daoist robe was pretty much completely transparent, while the material itself was rather soft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, Ye Zichen locked the office door, stripped, impatiently put on the robe, and then his clothes at the quickest speed possible.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Oh? It’s rather comfortable.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortal Heart of Pure Yang daily experience gain has changed. Current experience per day: 10.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye ZIchen smiled, then took out his phone and sent another message to Yue Lao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not bad, it seems like you earned quite a bit!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is all thanks to Sky Sovereign’s plans,” Yue Lao smiled softly, then replied. “Sky Sovereign, before the Jade Emperor left, he asked me whose idea it was. I didn’t dare to steal any credit, so I told him that it was your idea.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, Yue Lao did have some reason for saying that. He wanted to kiss ass, but…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He ass-kissed in the wrong way!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen felt like he was going to explode when he saw the message. </span><i><span style>This geezer actually told the Jade Emperor that it was my idea?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I’m supposed to be a deity in the Heavenly Court, what if the Jade Emperor actually looks for me? It’s not just me, even Taibai Jinxing just got screwed by this geezer!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao naturally didn’t know how Ye Zichen felt. At that moment, he was still gripping his phone tightly and staring intently at the screen, as if he was saying…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Praise me.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reply Yue Lao waited for intently was actually just a simple “oh”.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao was stunned. </span><i><span style>What’s going on with Sky Sovereign, does he not care?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“The Jade Emperor is very satisfied with your idea, he might even reward you greatly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Another “oh”.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao squinted his eyes. He, who was old and crafty, immediately thought of a possible reason. </span><i><span style>Sky Sovereign can’t be worried that I would want a piece of the cake, right…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao thought about it for a moment, then replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is natural for Jade Emperor to award Sky Sovereign. This little deity is not jealous at all, I merely ask Sky Sovereign to give me some discounts when I want to stock up goods!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled as if there was nothing to live for, while he clenched his fist tightly as he looked at Yue Lao’s kind-looking profile pic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This gramps…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen closed his chat with Yue Lao in annoyance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Yue Lao, who sat within the Marriage Hall was completely confused as he looked at Ye Zichen’s reply.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What does Sky Sovereign’s “hehe” mean?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could Sky Sovereign be so strong that he can ignore the Jade Emperor’s rewards? Then this Sky Sovereign is truly amazing!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He sent some more messages to Ye Zichen, but did not get any reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign’s not in service coverage again. Never mind, I’ll just say it when Sky Sovereign comes back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao was single and bored, and there was nothing for him to actually be anxious about, so since the Sky Sovereign wasn’t there, he decided to just wait.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Three days passed by in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei wore simple clothes, but they were unable to hide her voluptuous figure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Ye Zichen sat in the front seat and leisurely smoked, “Where are we going?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s too hard to find Yang Yushi directly. Since I coincidentally have a friend that says she knows someone at Yang Yushi’s side, I wanted to call out the person by Yang Yushi’s side through her to pass along a message.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So complicated!” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows. “Actually, there is no need for so much trouble.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You mean to change to someone else? I don’t think that’s so good, and it won’t have as good of an effect. Since we’re finding a spokesperson, we have to go and look for the best,” Xiao Yumei replied softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s face stiffened. What he actually wanted to say was that if it was too much trouble, then he would go and find Yang Yushi. They were technically friends, so it shouldn’t be too hard to get her to endorse their products.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for Yang Zhen, Ye Zichen believed that he wouldn’t interfere when it was purely business cooperation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, since Xiao Yumei said so, Ye Zichen could only shrug and remain silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Xiao Yumei parked the car, Ye Zichen was completely stunned. The business clubhouse in front of them was the one that Young Master Han opened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen even had a diamond card there, but that was something he gave to Mu Chuang to play with.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment they entered the lobby, Xiao Yumei directly took the elevator to the third floor with him. It was clear that both her and the other person had already decided on the meeting spot beforehand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As they pushed open the door to a room, a beautiful looking woman around Xiao Yumei’s age stood up to greet them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiao Yumei.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cai Xinyu,” Xiao Yumei smiled faintly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cai Xinyu’s face was also wreathed in smiles as she sat her gaze on Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zeze, this young handsome guy… Yumei, he can’t be your… little lover, right!?”</span></p>
