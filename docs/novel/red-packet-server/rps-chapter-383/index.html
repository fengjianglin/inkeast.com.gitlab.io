 <p><span style>Chapter 383 – Di Zun</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the apartment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Di Tian, who was wearing green clothes, stood beside a man with a similar appearance to him, who also had a long braid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Hou brother stood on either side of the room flanking the man, while Third Fatty Jin stood opposite Di Tian and the other man with a frown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great Emperor Qingming has already told the Di family, do not come and mind Di Tian…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t care about so much. Move aside, or fall!” The man beside Di Tian snorted coldly. He had been in closed cultivation earlier, and when he came out of it the previous day to find his little brother, he had found out that his little brother was actually being detained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the older brother, there was no way that he could tolerate it, so he promptly bought a plane ticket to Bingcheng against his family’s objections.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brat, you really are cocky. Wait a moment if you dare!” Third Fatty Yin snorted with a laugh, and put his hands on his hips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Di Tian’s older brother merely shrugged, “What can you do even if I wait here for a year?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even since his closed cultivation ended, he was already half a step into the level of Earth Immortals. He truly did not think highly of the people present in the room at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fine, brat… You really are cocky enough!” Third Fatty Jin gulped silently, then turned to Di Tian. “Di Tian, we’ve treated you rather nicely these days!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe…” Di Tian’s expression suddenly turned cold. It wasn’t too big of a deal if it wasn’t mentioned, but getting reminded of it really made Di Tian angry. “You really dare to say that. All I’ve been doing here is wash toilets and clean up the apartment. I’m essentially your maid, and you still say that you treated me nicely?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?” Di Tian’s older brother raised his eyebrows. “You guys actually made my little brother do that sort of dirty work!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He kicked off the floor with force, and punched towards Third Fatty Jin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have you asked me whether you can hit my people?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Faint laughter sounded out as Di Tian’s older brother was thrown to the side. He subconsciously looked up and saw Ye Zichen had appeared beside Third Fatty Jin without him even noticing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Ye,” Third Fatty Jin’s face was filled with joy. Then, he put his hands on his hips and cursed at Di Tian. “Grandson, try acting cocky now? Look, your dumb older brother was completely hit and shocked by Boss Ye. Hehe… Keep acting cocky!”</span></p>
 <p><span style> “Big Brother… It’s this brat!” Di Tian pointed at Ye Zichen and cursed. “He’s the one who turned me into a Transformer, then forced me to clean the toilet and stuff!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen merely maintained an indifferent smile in response.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked at Di Tian, who was voicing out his troubles indifferently, then set his gaze upon the man beside Di Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you called?”</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>“Di Zun<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>!” Di Tian’s brother answered sullenly.</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows. </span><i><span style>Wow, this Di family really names their children such bossy names. </span></i><span style>What’s more, Ye Zichen was able to feel that Di Zun was very powerful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Similarly, Di Zun also felt that Ye Zichen was equally troublesome.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let my little brother go. We won’t cross each other!” Di Zun broke the oppressive silence first.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Give me a reason!” Ye Zichen pursed his lips and smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won’t pursue the matter of you guys making my little brother be a maid!” Di Tian answered forcefully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen merely shook his head and smiled, “So what if you did pursue it? Do you think that I’m scared of you? Young man, don’t be so naïve, your little brother has to work here for me in order to repent for his crimes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What crimes?” Di Zun asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re going to have to ask him,” Ye Zichen said meaningfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Di Zun looked over at Di Tian, causing Di Tian’s expression to stiffen when he felt the interrogating gaze.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I definitely can’t tell him. The Di family rules are very strict, hidden families were not allowed to deal with people from the Modern Realm. What’s more, they weren’t allowed to hurt the people form the Modern Realm either…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>If I tell the truth, then wouldn’t I end up being skinned by my older brother?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother? How about I stay here to keep working? They are pretty nice to me here,” Di Tian answered with a coy smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Di Zun immediately shook his head solemnly, “No.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You really are hilarious. Di Tian himself said that he’s not leaving, and you want to forcefully take him away? In front of me?” As he spoke, Ye Zichen radiated a hint of spiritual pressure from his body. The heavy spiritual pressure caused everyone to feel fear in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It also made Fatty Jin raise his eyebrows in shock. Out of everyone, he was the one who knew the most about Ye Zichen’s change in strength.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He actually achieved this sort of strength in less than two short months.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>The Yellow Emperor’s reincarnation is truly not normal.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Di Zun was also able to feel the heaviness of the spiritual pressure. After thinking about it for a while, he relaxed his clenched fist, then stepped forward defenselessly and said, “I don’t want to fight you. We can actually strike a deal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do tell!” Ye Zichen smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I noticed several people spying on your place. I didn’t pay too much attention then, but now that I think about it, they should be your enemies. I’ll tell you their position. Let me take Di Tian away,” Di Tian called out softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen twitched his mouth and scratched his chin, “How strong are they?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The ones I can detect are naturally weaker than the Earth Immortal level. My guess is that they are of the Spiritual Body level at most,” Di Zun smiled. “If you don’t believe me, I can go and capture them!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please!” Ye Zichen smiled towards Di Zun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other party clearly did not expect Ye Zichen to answer like that either, but he did not say anything else, and instead left the room with a nod.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahem…” After Di Zun left, a look of nervousness blatantly surfaced on Di Tian’s face. The reason he acted so cockily earlier was only because his brother was supporting him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now that his older brother left, he was truly afraid of getting beaten up before his brother returned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big brothers, let’s chat properly. My older brother is going to come back soon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re still talking about your brother?” Third Fatty Jin raised his hands up as if he was about to hit Di Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Di Tian quickly took a defensive posture, “Fatty, I’m telling you. If you truly dare to hit me, then my older brother won’t let you off.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha, I, Lord Fatty, will definitely try today…” Third Fatty Jin prepared to walk over as he rolled up his sleeves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, Ye Zichen couldn’t help but knit his eyebrows, “Enough!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment, the door of the room was pushed open once again, while Di Zun walked in from the outside with two people in his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He chucked the two men onto the floor. Both of them held binoculars, Bluetooth earpieces and other equipment of the sort, making it obvious that they were planning to commit a crime.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve brought the people over to you,” Di Tian clapped with a chuckle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded, then squatted on the floor with a smile, “Why are you guys spying on me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you saying? We’re filming a celebrity in secret. Why did you guys capture us? We’ll call the police,” the thinner man immediately answered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded with a raise of his eyebrows, “Which celebrity? Tell me. But if you can’t…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Three silver needles appeared in his hands…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will definitely make you guys very happy!”</span></p>
