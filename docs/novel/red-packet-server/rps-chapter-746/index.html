 <p><span style>Chapter 746 – He is Big Brother’s Friend</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I knew it.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Cui Twelve expected this to happen the moment Liu Qing kneeled down to beg Lin Ru to allow her to stay a while longer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He knew that she would not come with him obediently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was time for him to step up as a big brother.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He flashed over to Liu Qing’s side and dragged her back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t want to leave, no! I don’t want to leave! Ye Zichen!” Liu Qing cried her heart out. She struggled and struggled, but the hand holding her merely remained still like a prison cuff.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She doesn’t want to leave, so why are you forcing her?” Ye Zichen tried to reach out to pull Liu Qing back into his arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will not take our relationship in mind if you take another step forward,” Cui Twelve pushed Liu Qing behind him and threatened with a frown. At the same time, he continued to push Liu Qing back to get out of there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t want to go…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Liu Qing said that she’s not leaving!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen felt something amiss from the very beginning. They have mentioned “time’s up” way too many times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wouldn’t have stopped them if Liu Qing wanted to leave, but now that she was crying and sobbing and refusing to leave, he was not going to let her go.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If Liu Qing doesn’t want to leave, then nobody’s going to take her away,” Ye Zichen glared at Cui Twelve.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He reached forward and tried to hold Liu Qing’s arm, but Cui Twelve knocked his arm away, then pushed Ye Zichen back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve warned you once,” Cui Twelve glared at Ye Zichen sullenly. He already chose to hold back without using too much spiritual energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Otherwise, with his strength of an Earth Supreme, Ye Zichen stood no chance at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh…” Ye Zichen stopped trying to talk some sense into Cui Twelve. He was going to help Liu Qing stay.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for Cui Twelve’s warning…</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Ye Zichen swung his right fist forwards. Cui Twelve stumbled back and narrowly avoided the attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the force behind the punch still left a bloody mark on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Ye Zichen followed up after missing the first attack. His attackers became fiercer and fiercer. This only agitated Cui Twelve more when he had to dodge the attacks while stopping Liu Qing from running away…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He could stand it no longer. He gathered up his spiritual energy and punched.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment he attacked, he realized it was too much. He shouldn’t have done that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He tried to soften the punch as much as he could, but even so…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen coughed up mouthfuls of blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aren’t you looking down on me way too much!?” Suddenly, Lin Ru burst out of nowhere in anger. She looked at Cui Twelve, who just threw a punch, murderously while Su Yan and Xia Keke stood beside her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the latter two saw what was going on, they immediately ran to Ye Zichen’s side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Zichen!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>And almost simultaneously, Liu Qing’s eyes also opened wide as she shouted, “Ye Zichen!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cui Twelve looked at his fist in shock, then glanced at Ye Zichen, who’s mouth was covered in blood.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just what was I doing? I was just going to take Liu Qing away. Why did I punch him? I already hold back a bit, but…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“B-Brother Ye…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing took the chance of Cui Twelve in a daze to run back to Ye Zichen’s side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cui Twelve tried to walk over as well, but Lin Ru stopped him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I knew you people wouldn’t stay put. You really think nothing of this new Master of the Law by using the strength of an Earth Supreme here! It looks like I have to teach you a good lesson,” with that, Lin Ru prepared to strike.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lin Ru, leave it,” Ye Zichen called out weakly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ru stopped in confusion, then noticed Ye Zichen shake his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Ye Zichen reached out to caress a strand of Liu Qing’s hair, “If you don’t want to leave, then stay.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I…” Liu Qing hesitated. “Let me heal you first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Around five minutes later, Liu Qing finally stabilized Ye Zichen’s condition.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little Seventeen!” Cui Twelve frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you urging her to leave all the time? She doesn’t want to…” Ye Zichen glared at Cui Twelve murderously before turning to Liu Qing in anticipation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He thought that she was going to stay, but Liu Qing had already stood up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her eyes were still filled with tears, but she seemed to have calmed down a little.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry, I got you hurt. I don’t want to leave and that’s the truth, but… I must.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing merely smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She turned around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And walked off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, she did not go back on her decision like before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She silently walked beside Cui Twelve and nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A rainbow bridge appeared on the mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go,” Liu Qing looked back at Ye Zichen one last time. She could see the confusion and worries on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was true.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was very confused, but he was sure that Liu Qing had her reasons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Turning back earlier was just her impulsiveness. Now that she calmed down, she thought everything through.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All he could do now was send her off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Liu Qing got further and further away, she couldn’t hold in her sorrows anymore. She almost broke down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet… for some reason, she started to forget why she was crying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And soon…</span></p>
 <p><span style>She stopped crying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She merely looked tearfully at the man waving at them from underneath the bridge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wipe your tears, otherwise, His Majesty will think that I bullied you or something,” Cui Twelve handed a handkerchief over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing tiled her head at Cui Twelve in confusion, “Big Brother Twelve, why was I crying? It was so strange…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cui Twelve was startled for a moment, then quickly regained his composure with a smile, “Did you forget about that really moving tale just now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What tale? I don’t recall anything,” Liu Qing blinked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Once upon a time, there was a girl…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cui Twelve told the story for an hour, but Liu Qing’s expression remained cold and emotionless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was crying because of that story?” Liu Qing shook her head with a snort. “Love? What a joke.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cui Twelve shuddered when he heard the ice-cold tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a while, he let out a long sigh, then patted Liu Qing’s head, “Alright, let’s leave it behind. You’ve cried already, so there is no point of thinking about that anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s true,” Liu Qing shrugged with a smile. Then, she slightly frowned. “Who was that person waving to us just now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Him..? He is my friend!”</span></p>
