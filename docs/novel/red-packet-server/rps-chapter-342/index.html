 <p><span style>Chapter 342 – The Night of the Junior Family Head Election (1)</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a long time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Ye Zichen was unable to refuse Ye Rong’s request, he nodded after thinking about it for a moment, “We’ll see. I’ll help if I can. I can’t do anything if I’m unable to help. I really don’t dare to try and imagine the acts of that little fellow Gu Li.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, Ye Rong smiled in relief, and patted Ye Zichen’s shoulders, “Alright, then do as you said, help him if you can.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Ye Rong left the room with a smile, Ye Zichen laid on the bed and took out his phone to check out what’s going on using WeChat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The latest moment was one that Su Yiyun sent. It was a photo of him and a beauty. Actually, it wasn’t strange for there to be a beauty around Su Yiyun, but the fact that he actually posted it publicly on his Moments was definitely shocking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Below the Moment was a bunch of reply from his roommates, most of which expressed their anger at him for reaching out his demonic claws at a beautiful girl once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shook his head with a chuckle, then liked the Moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Buzz.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within thirty seconds of him pressing the like, Su Yiyun called him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How’s it over at the capital? Do you kind of feel like a country bumpkin going into town?” Su Yiyun’s playful chuckles sounded out from Ye Zichen’s phone, while the sound of a girl’s giggle could occasionally be heard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows and ignored Su Yiyun’s mocking, “You really are free. You actually have time to call me when you’re with your girl?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, with our relationship… Isn’t it normal for me to call you to check up on you?” Su Yiyun said with a chuckled. “When are you coming back to Bingcheng. I want to introduce the two of you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“True love?” Ye Zichen said playfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“True love!” Su Yiyun answered determinedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, then wait a few days. When I finish with the stuff over here in the capital, I’m going to come back and see just what sort of person the girl that can mesmerize my bro like this is,” Ye Zichen said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun nodded, then hung up after saying a bit more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who were you calling just now?” a cute voice asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun raised his eyebrows, put his phone back into his pocket, then picked up a stick of Mala Tang, “My extremely good friend. I’ll let you guys meet when he comes back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen?” the girl blinked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun was shocked for a moment, “How’d you know?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You mentioned him to me before,” the girl answered calmly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really? I actually mentioned him to you!” Su Yiyun scratched his head, then answered with a smile. “That is possible, but you are rather amazing. You actually managed to remember him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm!” the girl nodded, and picked up a stick of Mala tang from the table. “Alright, let’s stop talking about him. Where are we going to play later?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Later… Let’s go to the arcade?” Su Yiyun asked in a testing manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure!” the girl nodded warmly, then stopped speaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Three days passed in the blink of an eye. During these three days, Ye Zichen had remained in the hotel and gathered information using Fatty Yin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The situation at the Gu household did not look good.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe… That brat, Gu Tian, should be regretting what he said a lot right now!” Fatty Yin crossed his legs and sat on the sofa. He casually chucked the information he just received to Ye Zichen. “Gu Li has already begun.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The information showed that the elders around the junior family head candidates had continuously died or disappeared in strange manners.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He asked for it. But don’t say that he’s regretting it. He won’t be able to guess anything with his intelligence,” Ye Zichen squinted his eyes emotionlessly, and took a simple look at the intel before chucking it back on the table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? You don’t want to help him?” Fatty Yin smiled. “Tonight seems to be the night to be the night where the Gu family elects their junior family head. Everyone around the people that can threaten Gu Li either died or disappeared, but he still has several elders supporting him. If there is no surprise, then the position of the junior family head might very well be his.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are the people from the Gu family idiots? I refuse to believe that the people from the Gu family can’t tell something as simple as these elders and guests being done in by Gu li,” Ye Zichen snorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Fatty Yin merely shrugged, “They aren’t idiots, and they can see that. But… so what?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Ye Zichen fell into silence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty Yin was right. The election for the junior family head was nigh, it was at the point where it had to continue to be held. Sure, the death or disappearances of the elders were indeed severe losses for the Gu family.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But… that was unable to stop the continuation of the junior family head election.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The election of the junior family head involved voting by the elders. The ones that either disappeared or dead might very well be those that Gu Li failed to coerce. If there was no surprise, then Gu Li should get the most votes from the remaining ones.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You still have three hours to decide. To help… or not. It’s up to you,” Fatty Yin stood up from the sofa and calpped his hands. At that moment, both Lu Lu and Gou Yuzhan walked in…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you’re going to help, then we’ll all follow you. If you want to mess up the Gu family’s election, we can help you as well. If you aren’t going to help, then don’t,” Lu Lu said with a giggle. At the same time, she held Ye Zichen’s shoulder tightly. “No matter what, I’m just going to follow you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They promised to give me a dozen lollipops afterwards. Boss Ye, you can’t keep it away from me then,” Gou Yuzhan also yammered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Three… hours?” Ye Zichen squinted his eyes and muttered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the Gu household.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the election of the junior family head was nigh, all of the descendants of the main family and branch family hurried over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, it could be said that there were a lot of people at the Gu household, but the atmosphere was incomparably strange.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every candidate was carefully dressing themselves up, but most of their expressions revealed a hint of helplessness…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Aside from…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Li!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He smiled leisurely. At that moment, he no longer sat on a wheelchair. He wore a straight black suit, while he smiled at his own reflection in the mirror. He was able to feel the fire in his eyes from looking at his own reflection…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Junior family head election,” Gu Li smiled and touched his smooth chin. Then he turned around and looked at the man with bronze-colored skin within the room. “Those people are all in control, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Naturally!” the man laughed sinisterly. “If there is no accident, then you will definitely become the junior family head this time. When that happens, we’ll find a chance to kill off the Gu family’s geezer, after which you’ll become the number one successor to the position of the Gu clan’s family head.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right,” Gu Li pursed his lips and smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, the man spoke up once again, “But don’t forget your promise to us. We have been doing our best to help you in this cooperation.”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Original Chapter Teaser:</b>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Help him? After he pushed me away like that? Everything I did over at the Gu household was for his own good, it was to help him! And yet...</p>
 <p>Just what am I supposed to do? Am I supposed to go over there and apologize? I was not wrong at all. What's more, since he was the one who invited me to help him with the junior family head election, shouldn't he trust me? Just what the heck was with that attitude!?</p>
 <p>That's exactly why he's going to get eaten alive by his brothers, or rather, it'll probably be brother. That Gu Li's endurance was truly too good, and the fact that he faked paralysis of his legs for so long is just absolutely terrifying. I can't even begin to imagine just what sort of crap he endured.</p>
 <p>Against someone like Gu Li, Gu Tian stands no chance, and that's why I have to help him. But... How? Even if he is supposed to be my cousin, and the child of the brother my mother was the closest with, I am only an outsider now. Since he refused to listen to me, then there isn't really anything I can do...</p>
 <p>Yet... Mom's request... it isn't something that I can refuse so easily.</p>
 <p>Fine, if it really comes down to it, I will help him out.</p>
