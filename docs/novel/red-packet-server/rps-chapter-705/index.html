 <p><span style>Chapter 705 – Guest from the Beast Region</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tiantian blinked in confusion as she felt Ye Zichen stiffen, “Daddy, what is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm, it’s nothing. Tiantian, go back to your Big Sister Zuo Mo. Daddy will come over soon, tell that guest to wait a bit,” he put Tiantian back onto Lil’ Lan, then rubbed her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tiantian blinked, then nodded as she left with a giggle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did the messenger finally come?” Xuan-Yuan Xiang knew about the news of the God Realm’s messenger, and she also knew what the messenger descended for.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s very likely,” Ye Zichen nodded, then reorganized his thoughts as he recalled the news he had read in the group. “The Heavenly Court group said that the God Realm’s messenger descended an hour ago. That’s pretty much enough time for them to reach the outer regions of the Immortal Region. What I don’t understand is how he found this subdimension.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The people of the God Realm must have their ways,” Xuan-Yuan Xiang was in a slightly bad mood as well. She could still clearly remember how helpless the Yellow Emperor had been in the past when faced with the God Realm’s threats.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>If the person from the God Realm is going to do the same thing as back then, then…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go and take a look,” Ye Zichen was in a better state of mind compared to Xuan-Yuan Xiang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since the messenger has come, no matter what, he had to go over to meet him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They walked over to the central courtyard. It was the place where the ones in charge would often gather to discuss about matters. The only ones allowed in were only the people who were originally the outer region’s city lords and generals, or the sect master or elders of larger sects.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, there were some hidden experts who only revealed their strength after the demons attacked and did not take upon any position in the outer regions of the Immortal Region prior to that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the past six months, practically everyone had found out about Ye Zichen’s existence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The supreme leader of the great alliance, the powerful master of Leisure House, and the reincarnation of the sacred land’s Yellow Emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of these titles caused them to pay more attention to Ye Zichen, but at the same time, they also contributed to the burden carried on his shoulders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Ye,” the moment Ye Zichen arrived, Xue Qi welcomed him. He was someone who cared a lot about courtesy, and did feel troubled for a very long time after finding out Ye Zichen’s identity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fortunately, the stubborn Stone was able to talk him out of his troubled mood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tiantian just told me that there are guests who said specifically that they would like to meet me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm,” Xue Qi nodded. “They did indeed ask to see you, specifically. They are especially strong. At the very least, they’re all above the strength of Stone and I. Qiu Yuan and Zuo Mo are in the meeting halls right now. I asked Qiu Yuan about their strength, and he said that even he felt a little bit of pressure when facing them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How many of them are there?” Ye Zichen asked with a frown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Quite a few. Five women and seven men, but some of them look a bit familiar. I think I’ve seen them before,” Xue Qi frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was rather surprised.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Familiar?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is it not the God Realm’s messenger after all?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded towards Xue Qi, then went over to the meeting hall. When he saw who the guests were, he immediately stopped worrying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss,” the first to leap towards him was Lil’ White, the Sky Swallowing Dog.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rubbed his hair and looked at the other people in the meeting hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was the Great Sage, Yuan Hong, Zhuge Kongming, Jail King, Fatty Yin and a dragon senior.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As well as Su Yan, Xia Keke, Lu Lu, Su Zhu, and big sister Su Liu’er who had her ice-cold expression on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did you guys come?” Ye Zichen was beyond joyful to see them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? You didn’t want I, Old Sun, to come?” the Great Sage hooked his arm around Ye Zichen’s shoulder like a rascal. “I, Old Sun, heard that mah bro had also become a king himself, so I brought my guys from the Beast Region over to congratulate you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great Sage, who did you hear it from? How am I a king?” Ye Zichen shrugged with a wry smile. “I see that you guys have fully recovered?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That was nothing! I, Old Sun, have the seventy-two transformations, so that’s seventy-two lives,” Great Sage Sun twitched his mouth uncaringly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen couldn’t help but recall what it was like back then…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sun Wukong’s life was truly on the line.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Also, who was the ‘her’ the Great Sage was talking about before?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen scratched his head and looked meaningfully at Yuan Hong, before repeatedly winking at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You got sand in your eyes?” Yuan Hong raised his eyebrows in confusion. Ye Zichen rolled his eyes, then indicated towards Su Liu’er with his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it?” Yuan Hong was like a log, and didn’t understand what Ye Zichen meant at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Zhu shrugged, “He wants to ask how is it going between you and my sister.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahh, my Zhu-jie knows me much better,” Ye Zichen chuckled. “Liu’er-jie promised to be with you back then, have the two of you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s not talk about it,” Yuan Hong put on a troubled look and started to complain. “Liu’er did promise to be with you, but there was a condition.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows and thought about it for a moment. “It can’t be asking you to defeat her, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Ye, you’re right. Man, don’t you think that’s just a trap? Who the heck could beat her in the Endless Beast Region?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I, Old Sun, could,” Great Sage Sun suddenly interrupted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Bro, can you stop making things difficult for me?” Yuan Hong rolled his eyes, then sobbed. “Brother Ye, don’t you think that you just screwing me over?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course my man has to be stronger than me. What’s the point of him if he can’t even beat me?” Su Liu’er said indifferently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuan Hong twitched his mouth and walked off like a little grudging wife.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t look at me, I’m doing really well with Lil’ Zhu,” Fatty Yin quickly said as he grabbed Su Zhu’s waist after sensing Ye Zichen’s gaze on him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Su Zhu did struggle a bit, it was more in embarrassment than anything. Ye Zichen looked at Fatty Yin’s proud look. </span><i><span style>Wow, they really </span></i><b><i>are </i></b><i><span style>doing well.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, he felt a gaze looking at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rather, it was a gaze that never once shifted from him ever since he entered the meeting halls.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen felt a mixed bag of feelings for her, and that was even more so after absorbing all of his memories of his past lives.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unsure of what to do, he could only pretend to not notice her gaze and smile towards the Great Sage, “There must be important matters for the Great Sage to visit. Don’t tell me there isn’t, in this sort of situation…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm, I, Old Sun, did come here for something important,” the Great Sage squinted his eyes with a smile. “The demons in the Endless Beast Region have been swept clean. It’s time to cleanse the Immortal Region of their filth!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sire!” a messenger appeared in the meeting halls before Ye Zichen could finish talking. “The God Realm’s messenger has arrived.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…” Ye Zichen’s expression turned stark white.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I guess I can’t avoid this.</span></i></p>
 <p></p>

 <p>In the meeting halls...</p>
 <p><b>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</b>So... Which of you is...</p>
 <p><strong>Monkey King:&nbsp;</strong>Yo!</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Great Sage! Why are you here? I thought that it was the God Realm's messenger</p>
 <p><strong>Yuan Hong:&nbsp;</strong>Sorry to disappoint you, but it's not. We've come because we have cleansed the Beast Region of the demon filth. We thought you might want to do the same with the Immortal Region.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Ahh yes, that's amazing...</p>
 <p><strong>Monkey King:</strong>&nbsp;Bro, you look troubled, what is it?</p>
 <p><strong>Xia Keke:&nbsp;</strong>Big Brother Zichen! What happened?</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>No, it's nothing. It's just that...</p>
