 <p><span style>Chapter 713 – The Eight Formation Origin Chart’s Critical Weakness</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone in the surrounding area were shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your world?” Black Dragon asked with a frown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, my world. The light within the darkness. It was you who grant me infinite strength…[1. 我的世界 by 杨啟:</span><a href="http://www.lizhi.fm/1952568/2518109257001634822" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style>http://www.lizhi.fm/1952568/2518109257001634822</span></a><span style>] &nbsp;Sorry, I couldn’t help but start singing…” Ye Zichen smiled apologetically, but everyone could tell that it was just mockery. “Just calm down and stay in here. Don’t think about leaving. You shouldn’t be able to break through this mirage formation with your strength.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was no lie, since Fatty Yin is from the God Realm himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more the Eight Formations Origin Chart is the divine artifact ranked twenty-third on the divine artifact rankings. Even Sky Supremes will take a long time to get out of the formation set by the chart, so it was even more true for the demons.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>A mirage formation?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>For some reason, Black Dragon calmed down a little after hearing that. Normally speaking, mirage formations couldn’t actually attack, and the person who set up the formation has to use his own spiritual energy to maintain it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As long as the mirage formation was still around, then the person who set up the formation as still around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, why do we need to break out? We cannot leave, but can you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who said I’m leaving? Ye Zichen understood what Black Dragon was referring to. He turned towards Lorie, who was getting ready. “Lil’ Lorie, teach them a lesson. Don’t hit them too hard, we’re going to have a long play session.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay, okay,” Lorie nodded with a giggle. She raised her first at one of the people in the mirage formation. “Ahh, why are you so ugly!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahh, why are you bald? I don’t like that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm, you seem nervous. Hehe, I’m behind you. Oh wow, why are you so dumb, I told you behind you. Behind you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lorie punched a demon sovereign in the nose.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, you… Yes, I’m calling you, the guy with the braids…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lorie was having the time of her life in the mirage formation. Her personality is like that of a child’s and the demons in the formation has now turned into her favorite toys as she giggled and messed around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The one who was focused most was naturally the stout Great Emperor Yonghe. Ye Zichen detested him, who had betrayed the Three Realms even though he was an important figure in the Immortal Region.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s why he told Lorie to ‘take good care of him’.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One should never underestimate Lorie’s little fists. Regardless, she was at the peak of the Immortal King level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The demon sovereigns within the mirage formation were truly troubled. Even Black Dragon was in a terrible state with his face swollen on the right side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only one who was fine was Li Min’e. No matter what, that was someone Ye Zichen did consider an acquaintance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just wait,” Black Dragon gritted his teeth and endured the beating. </span><i><span style>It would take a large amount of spiritual energy to maintain this sort of mirage formation.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>When the person who set the formation is dried up of spiritual energy, then…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Why do you have such a menacing look? Bad boy, I’ll punish you!” Just as Black Dragon grit his teeth a clear giggle sounded out beside her ear. Before he could even determine where his enemy will attack from, he was punched on his left cheek.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, this is so fun,” a singsong-like giggle sounded out from the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon had enough, “You are seeking death!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This angry roar scared Lorie. She pouted like a bullied little bunny.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was instantly annoyed. He reached out and caressed Lorie’s hair, then started to smack Black Dragon’s head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shout, shout, shout, shout some more. Look at what you did to our little Lorie!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Keep shouting!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Keep shouting!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Raging spiritual energy surged forth from Black Dragon. Although the mirage formation was very powerful and the demons were unable to leave, they were still able to see half a meter around them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So, when he saw Ye Zichen stand beside him and smack his head, Black Dragon reached out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen jumped back more than half a meter as if he predicted Black Dragon’s action. Then, he patted his chest, “Oh wow. Boy, you still want to fight back? You’re pretty tough.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Creak.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He’s pissing me off!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon wanted to curse loudly, while the spiritual energy within his body continued to rampage. He really wanted to ignore the mirage formation and just attack the entire area.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as he was unable to endure it anymore…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t,” Yonghe suddenly pressed down on Black Dragon’s shoulder. “Don’t fall into his trap.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon couldn’t help but tremble in anger due to his rage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Great Emperor Yonghe finally used his spiritual energy to apply a calming technique on Black Dragon. Then, when Black Dragon finally calmed down a little, he squinted his eyes, “Don’t you find it weird? Ye Zichen trapped us here, but didn’t kill us. What’s more, although the person who set up the formation cannot leave, the ley line is of utmost importance, he can just discard the person who set up the formation and leave with the ley line. Why is he wasting time with us?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon noticed that before, but he really wouldn’t explain it. He was in no mood to consider all that. He was very very angry after getting slapped in the face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why do you think that is?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This Yonghe really is trouble. </span></i><span style>Ye Zichen’s expression darkened when he saw Yonghe calm Black Dragon down. He clenched his fists tightly and glared at Yonghe, wishing to tear Yonghe to shreds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But… he couldn’t.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Eight Formation Origin Chart was an excellent divine artifact for setting up formations, so much so that even Fatty Yin, who knew nothing of spiritual formations, could set up frightening formations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If that was all the divine artifact did, it made no sense for it to only be twenty-third on the divine artifact ranking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, that was no mistake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So why was this shocking divine artifact ranked so low?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Because it had a critical weakness!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The people in the formation cannot be killed!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Indeed, it’s critical weakness was that it was unable to help one kill his enemies, regardless of the formation it was used to set up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even the attacking Heaven Incinerating Formation could only wound, but not kill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was why it was ranked so low, and that was why Ye Zichen and Lorie didn’t kill all the demons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Otherwise, Ye Zichen would have already killed Black Dragon ten times over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He must be trapping us to wait for something?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Great Emperor Yonghe finished, a commotion rang out amongst the demon sovereigns. Not long later, one of them walked over with a jade tablet. “My Lord, Maple City, Hundred Flowers City and the rest of the ten cities we were guarding have fallen.”</span></p>

 <p></p>
 <p><b>Black Dragon:&nbsp;</b>Your world?</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Yes my world, didn't I say it clearly enough? If you are still unsure, let me tell you, it's spelled m-y space w-o-r-l-d. My world.</p>
 <p><strong>Black Dragon:</strong> Why you little!?</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Stop right there. First of all, you're not a big fat yellow guy that's nearly bald. Second of all, you don't have s good looking of a son as me. So shut it with the references.</p>
 <p><strong>Black Dragon:&nbsp;</strong>Ye Zichen, hand over the ley line.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Ley line? Pfft, whatever dude. Do me a favor, chill here, stop worrying about the ley line and... Try to have some fun alright? Of course, what I mean is, let us have some fun. After all, you're in for a damn nice beatdown!</p>
