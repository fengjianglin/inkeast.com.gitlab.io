 <p><span style>Chapter 704 – Six Months Later</span></p>
 <p><span style>Six months later…</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the past six months, everything seemed to calm down. The demons remained in the various cities in the outer regions of the Immortal Region and did not attack any of the Three Realms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Without the imminent danger of the demons, the Heavenly Court and the Underworld returned to how they were before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Under Great Emperor Qingming’s aid, the life of the civilians also gradually returned to normal as they remained in the subdimension Gu Zichen left behind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The civilians seemed to have grown used to the subdimension and started to treat it as their home.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for Ye Zichen…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was covered in a faint golden light as he saw on top of a steep mountain with a ball of cold fire spiraling around him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fire was a beast flame.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was something that fell off Lil’ Lan the winged dragon a while ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment, the spiritual pressure around Ye Zichen seemed to increase massively. Xuan-Yuan Xiang, who was standing guard beside him, floated over. “You broke through?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen opened his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Spiritual energy materialized and rocketed outwards, cutting a nearby peak in half.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen let out a soft sigh, then stood up with a nod, “Yeah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Only six months from a mid-stage Sky Immortal to being half a step into the Immortal King level. That cultivation speed is truly shocking,” Xuan-Yuan Xiang couldn’t help but smile. She was happy to see Ye Zichen grow stronger and stronger. After all, the stronger he was, the stronger Xuan-Yuan Sword was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s just because I am a reincarnation,” Ye Zichen shook his head with a smile. He didn’t really think much about his strength.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Even Gu Zichen couldn’t do anything about the future threat of the demons, so what can I do with my level of strength?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>During so, he had asked others about the levels above an Immortal King.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earth Supreme, Sky Supreme, Diviner, Ruler, Exceed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Each of those levels were supposed to be split into nine ranks, with every rank being a true difference in strength. Originally, he had wanted to ask the Wish God just how strong were the “Gods”.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But no matter how he talked to the seven stones, the wish god didn’t come out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, ignoring someone like the Wish God, Ye Zichen found out that Gu Zichen was already a peak existence in the God Realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xuan-Yuan Xiang glanced at Ye Zichen and knew that he was deep in thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She patted Ye Zichen’s shoulder with a smile, “Don’t put too much pressure on yourself. He definitely told you a lot before he left, but we should still have enough time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Probably,” with that, Ye Zichen subconsciously took out his phone once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the past six months, aside from cultivation, the thing he did the most was gathering information from the various chat groups.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To no surprise, the Red Packet Server was always lively.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were always 99+ unread messages whenever he opened the app.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For the past six months, the only news he got from the server was either a deity finally finding another half, or someone asking for help since their kid ran away from home. Although the group was lively, there haven’t actually been too much useful information.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hopefully there’ll be something useful this time. </span></i><span style>Ye Zichen thought silently, then read what was going on. His expression stiffened a split second after reading what was going on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: New news on the God Realm’s messenger!</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: What is it?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: The God Realm’s messenger has only been eating and drinking in the Heavenly Court, and it’s all been rare stuff. I’m so jealous!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mother of Lightning: ^ Don’t change the topic. What is the new information on the God Realm’s messenger?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: I heard it straight from the Queen Mother. She said that the God Realm’s messenger is descending from the Heavenly Court to search for the divine artifact.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Barefoot Immortal: Are you for real?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: The messenger really is going to search for the divine artifact?</span></p>
 <p><span style>All-Hearing Ear: I can confirm all Immortality Peach Fairy said to be true!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: Since All-Hearing Ear said that, then it most likely is the case.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Is the divine artifact really going to be seen? But aren’t demons over at the Immortal Region? How is the God Realm’s messenger going to take the divine artifact?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Gang: Will the God Realm’s messenger actually care about the demons? Maybe the messenger might be in a good mood after getting the divine artifact and just kill them all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Then hurry it up. I’m really sick of being a spy here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha: Yeah.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Announcement: As the Immortality Peach Fairy recklessly spread secrets of the Heavenly Court, she has been punished to face the walls for a hundred years, effective immediately. If anyone else spreads news about the messenger, then they will be stripped of their celestial position and exiled from the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Profound Lady of the Nine Heavens: You see the announcement? Do as you see fit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The group instantly went silent for five minutes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: That was horrible!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Barefoot Immortal: Yeah. She’s just a cute little girl.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha; Immortality Peach Fairy-jiejie, wait for me. I will definitely rescue you when I return to the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King Li: Let’s all stay put and don’t mention the messenger anymore. Let’s end this right here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a few retorts, the topic did successfully changed. Ye Zichen squinted his eyes, then opened his chat with Immortality Peach fairy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When did the God Realm’s messenger descend?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Sky Sovereign! You have to give justice to little sister!” Immortality Peach fairy sobbed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I definitely will. But tell me, when did the messenger descend?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“About an hour ago.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, I got it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Announcement: Immortality Peach Fairy has been pardoned. I’ll kick you all if you dare to act out of line on my turf!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The group members took several seconds to read the new announcement in surprise. Then, they immediately realized it was from Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>People in the group immediately begun to flatter Ye Zichen for exerting his dominance, while some other people started to feel envious of the immortality Peach Fairy for having a nice older brother.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen was in no mood to read all that. All he was thinking about was what the God Realm’s messenger was doing.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Descended an hour ago. Doesn’t that mean that he will be here soon?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen gripped Xuan-Yuan Sword tighter.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is this going to be like last time as well?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Daddy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Lil’ Tiantian came over on top of Lil’ Lan, the winged dragon, while Tenner, the Soul Pearl Yiyuan followed beside her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ Lan and Tenner were supposed to be </span><i><span style>his </span></i><span style>mount and protective treasure, but they were far closer to Lil’ Tiantian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In fact, they were always with Tiantian, and had pretty much forgotten about him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>But I guess that’s good, at least they can help me take care and protect Tiantian.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen picked Tiantian up with a smile. She seemed to have grown up a lot more during the past six months. Although she was still a little loli, she begun to seem more like a young girl.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did you come over here?’ Ye Zichen still spoiled his daughter a lot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Sister Zuo Mo told me to come and find you. She said there is a guest looking for you,” Tiantian giggled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen trembled. </span><i><span style>So he’s here!</span></i></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Original Chapter Teaser:</strong>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>In the following six months, everything seemed to have calmed down. The demons did not lead any more attacks against any parts of the Three Realms, those of the Heavenly Court and Underworld returned to their own realms. Meanwhile, the civilians formerly residing within the outer region of the Immortal Region now seemed to have accepted the subdimension as their new home. They began to rebuild everything and live their lives there. Everything seemed... calm.</p>
 <p>However, everyone knew that it was not going to last. It was the calm before the storm. Once the trigger is pulled, war will engulf the Three Realms once more, and that trigger... was coming.</p>
 <p>The God Realm's messenger left the Heavenly Court. Where was the messenger going? The deities of the Heavenly Court did not know. However, Ye Zichen did. He understood very well what the messenger had descended for. It was for him. Or more precisely, for the weapon that has been with him since his first life - Xuan-Yuan Sword!</p>
