 <p><span style>Chapter 744 – I beg of you</span></p>
 <p><span style>Flames surged out as Liu Qing finished her words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sid let out terrible screams as the purple fire started to cover him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter how hard he tried to slap them out, no matter the technique he used to try and rid himself of the fire…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The flames did not go out!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sid rolled on the ground in a desperate attempt to douse the flames. But it was futile. Soon, he his movements gradually slowed down until he could only writhe, until he finally laid still.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, the flames also stopped burning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sid was fully burnt, and a small layer of ice covered him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is it over?” Jade Emperor muttered. Fear filled his body when Sid turned into a giant that towered over them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And Liu Qing’s sudden increase in power also dumbfounded him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>As expected of the God Realm’s messenger.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Great Sacred Emperor Equaling Heavens also silently gulped. He was less than half a meter from death earlier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the young girl in front of them that saved them all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing wobbled, then started to fall. But Cui Twelve quickly got a hold of her before she hit the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you alright?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing smiled with a shake of her head, “I just feel a bit weak. We’ve caused quite the commotion here, so let’s get out of here. Otherwise, it’ll be troublesome when the demons come.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then, what should we do about him…” Cui Twelve pointed at Sid’s burnt corpse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing gently tapped the layer of ice with her ribbon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The corpse shattered into tiny pieces that dissolved into the air of demonic energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cui Twelve’s eyes twitched…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The extreme of fire is truly powerful.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the past few days, Ye Zichen sat in the courtyard of the mansion and gazed up into the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For some reason, he just had an irking feeling that something bad was about to happen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other people did understand his feelings so they never went over to bother him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm?” Just as Ye Zichen lit a cigarette for himself, he noticed a few unusual fluctuations of spiritual energy in the other region of the Immortal Region.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had become extremely sensitive to the change in spiritual energy after nearly the Immortal King level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He leaped into the air to see what was going on, then finally stopped worrying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A soft smile appeared on his face as he looked towards the girl who was smiling at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Welcome back,” Ye Zichen opened his arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing quickly broke free from Cui Twelve and dashed into Ye Zichen’s embrace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She buried her face in his chest. At that moment…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nobody spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And all Ye Zichen felt was the girl’s tremble in his arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoosh…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, a girl in a police uniform appeared in the sky. She wore a large cap just like a security police officer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a very common getup in the Modern Realm, but seemed strangely out of place in the Immortal Region.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I just started work, why is someone always trying to get on my bad side now!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was no other than Lin Ru, the new Master of the Law.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ru had her hands on her waist then glared around like a mad woman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen!” Her scream echoed through the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you here again?” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes, then noticed Lin Ru’s clothes. “Huh? You’ve fallen for cosplay recently?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk, oh wow. You have that girl always following you around and now you’re holding this young one. Do you really not care about Susu anymore? I’m telling you, Su Yan was the true school beauty of Polytechnic University, anybody would spoil her beyond reason. But you? You’re the real Casa Nova aren’t you?” Lin Ru shouted, then indicated towards Liu Qing and Cui Twelve with a frown. “These two have surpassed the level of spiritual energy allowed here. I have to exile them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So she is Lin Ru?” Liu Qing said weakly. She still remembers all the people Ye Zichen knows after following him around as a ghost for a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, she is now the Master of the Law here,” Ye Zichen replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master of the Law!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing, Cui Twelve, the Jade Emperor, and Great Sacred Emperor Equaling Heavens all gasped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Law.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was something that they could not touch and should never defy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And now they have finally seen the face of the Master of the Law.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You know me?” Lin Ru wasn’t deaf, she naturally heard what Liu Qing said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, he eyes twitched as she put her hands on her hip, “Ye Zichen, you are truly terrible. I thought you only had a few girls by your side in the Modern Realm, so you were hiding this little girl there too!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shut it,” Ye Zichen said sullenly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, whatever. I’m telling you again, the two of them are stronger than the level this realm can endure. I have to exile them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lin Ru!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even if you glare at me, I still have the exile them. The Law is The Law,” Lin Ru refused to give in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Sister Lin Ru, please, I beg of you, can you let me stay here for half a day longer?” Liu Qing struggled out of Ye Zichen’s arms and kneeled on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Liu Qing, what are you doing?” Ye Zichen tried to help her up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cui Twelve also frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Liu Qing continued to look at Lin Ru with tear-filled eyes, “I beg of you, also The Law cannot be defied, but you are the Master of the Law. You can definitely change The Law for just a moment. I do not ask to stay here forever. Just half a day, please just half a day… Is that alright? I promise to not use any spiritual energy and not cause any troubles for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you doing?” Lin Ru was completely stunned at Liu Qing’s reaction. She did appear to be cold and uncaring, but it was just an act.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had merely wanted to exile the girl as soon as possible not just because of The Law, but also because she didn’t like Ye Zichen’s personality.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But now…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Get up to speak!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please let me stay here for half a day longer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Although I am the Master of the Law…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You definitely can, please, I beg of you,” tears flowed down Liu Qing’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t stand it anymore. He tried to pick Liu Qing up, “What are you doing, we have plenty of time to see each other in the future, so there is no need to beg her. Even if you can’t descend in the future, I can go over to the God Realm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Liu Qing continued to shake her head and look intently at Lin Ru.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whatever,” Lin Ru did the only thing she could think of.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since she wasn’t sure of how to deal with it, she turned and left.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ugh, whatever, I’ll just avoid them!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Gah, it sucks to be the Master of the Law right now!</span></i></p>
