 <p><span style>Chapter 372 – Stone Fairy Learns to Put On Makeup</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both Ye Zichen and Xia Keke were rather confused when they thought back to the way the girls looked at them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, they couldn’t help but wonder just how they offended the girls in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The reason we went to the shop was just to buy a set of cosmetics, and it was completely unplanned. So were we not supposed to buy cosmetics…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Or perhaps they were only hostile towards us because they know that I’m Yao Yue’s ex?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Fine, then I suppose it’s my fault.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t mind them, it might be because of me!” Ye Zichen shrugged helplessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke couldn’t help but frown, “What does it have to do with you? The two of you broke up because she cheated, it wasn’t your fault.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who knows,” Ye Zichen smiled, then rubbed Xia Keke’s hair softly. “Ignore them, I still have an important mission for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they got back into the car, Ye Zichen took out his phone, and went to find the Stone Fairy he had gotten into contact with the previous day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stone Fairy, you there?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Stone Fairy replied practically instantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen glanced over at Xia Keke, “You should know how to put on makeup, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though he has known Xia Keke and the rest for a long time, he can’t recall seeing them with makeup on. Even if they did, it was a light makeup at best.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since all of them looked amazing even without any makeup on, Ye Zichen truly had his suspicions that these girls completely ignored learning how to put on makeup because they were born with such beauty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t ask this sort of idiotic question, alright?” Xia Keke rolled her eyes at him. “Do you think any university girls wouldn’t know how to put on makeup?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“… I’ve never seen you with makeup on, so I thought that you might not know!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk…” Xia Keke twitched her mouth. “I’m just too lazy to put any on, and am worried about being envied by those common girls. The prettier the girl, the better they are at putting on makeup. Got it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled softly when he saw her tsundere-like reaction “Alright, it’s fine as long as you know how to put on makeup!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? Don’t tell me that you want me to teach you how to put on makeup!” Xia Keke exclaimed as if she discovered a new continent. “I really couldn’t tell. You… I’ll definitely tell Susu when I get back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t overthink!” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes at her, then sent a response to Stone Fairy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you free? How about helping you become beautiful right now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m always free.” Stone Fairy replied instantly once again. “What do you need me to do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm, collect this red packet!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Ye Zichen directly sent over all of the cosmetics Xia Keke picked out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Stone Fairy received your red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are all these? Zeze, the ingredients are so bad, and it's actually harmful for the body.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was worried that Stone Fairy would retort, so he intentionally got Xia Keke to choose high-end cosmetics, but Stone Fairy still ended up retorting.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Fine, the Modern Realm cannot compare with the Heavenly Court. Since she was just pointing out how bad the ingredients are, I’ll admit it.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Ignore what the ingredients are and how good the quality is. These can make you beautiful. Just tell me if you want to use it or not!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“These shitty things can make laoniang beautiful?” Stone Fairy asked in disbelief. “Alright, someone that Little Brother Yang Jian introduced probably wouldn’t trick laoniang. Then tell me, what should I do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>….</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This fairy is definitely a strong independent woman in the Heavenly Court.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen thought quickly to himself, then handed his phone over to Xia Keke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? You can’t possibly want me to teach Stone Fairy how to put on makeup, right!? No way, god knows if she’s a mistress you have outside…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t overthink. This is a fairy from the Heavenly Court, I want to start a makeup class in the Heavenly Court…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heavenly Court?” Xia Keke’s eyes lit up. She snatched over the phone with a giggle and muttered. “This is my first time dealing with anyone in the Heavenly Court since I was born!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, despite saying that, she did not chat seriously with Stone Fairy at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a good half another has passed, Xia Keke directly told Stone Fairy all her knowledge about makeup.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can become pretty just by applying this shitty paste onto my face?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Stone Fairy still didn’t believe it at all. These cosmetics were truly too low-leveled in her eyes. However, Xia Keke had made them sound so miraculous…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Believe me, it’ll be alright!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Xia Keke did as Ye Zichen said, and sent Stone Fairy the makeup videos she prepared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just do as I said, and follow the tutorial in the video.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let me figure it out…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Stone Fairy clicked on the video with her suspicions, then looked at the bottles in front of her with a frown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Xia Keke also returned the phone to Ye Zichen with a giggle, “Done!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rubbed her head again and smiled, “I’ll remember this achievement of yours!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, I spent too much energy by teaching the fairy just now. A new dessert shop opened near our school. Take me there to eat!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay, okay, okay. Tell me the location, I’ll bring you over.” Ye Zichen began to drive with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Yao Yue and her roommates also returned to her dorm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While they were returning, Yao Yue did not utter a single word. All her other roommates thought that she was depressed after witnessing her boyfriend cheat on her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she was nervous…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just what would have happened if Ye Zichen exposed me there and then.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Yao Yue, don’t mind too much. It’s very normal for a man of his level to have a few women outside,” the rich girl comforted Yao Yue when they got back to the dorm. “What you have to do is be forgiving. After he played enough outside, the one standing by his side will still be you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I…” Yao Yue bit her lips as her heart struggled. There was many times that she wanted to come clean, but…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That damn vanity.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright now, I can understand you very well, but I still advise you to not mind so much,” the rich girl smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other roommates also couldn’t help but retort, “I never thought that he was actually someone like that, and I actually followed his Weibo. I’m going to unsubscribe.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, many of the girls ran over to their computers, while the rich girl continued to comfort Yao Yue by her side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Approximately half an hour later, one of the girls stood up with a frown, then clapped in celebration, “The girl beside Yao Yue’s boyfriend is the school beauty of our school, right? Hmmph, now she’s notoriously famous!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, the other girls all surrounded her computer, and saw that at the very top of the school’s forum was actually a thread about Xia Keke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they saw the contents…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yao Yue slapped the girl’s face, then shouted out crazily, “Who told you to do that!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, the phone of Xia Keke, who was eating dessert at the dessert shop near the school also rang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her expression drastically changed after picking up the phone. Then, she quickly hung up and logged onto the school’s forums…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who did this!?”</span></p>
