 <p>Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The lights on the sixth floor of the floating Seven Treasures Pagoda instantly lit up.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The suctioning force at the pagoda’s base suddenly multiplied. Even the surrounding space was torn to bits as a black hole formed directly beneath the tower.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When the Count of Wind and Lord of Rain saw the sixth floor light up, they were visibly shaken.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Ol’ Li, do you really have to be like this?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Before even finishing his sentence, the Count of Wind saw a trail of fresh blood drip from Heavenly King Li’s mouth. Even so, he looked utterly unyielding.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I can’t help it. I’ve always been a tough nut to crack. Capture!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The black hole at the tower’s base rotated. When the Count of Wind and Lord of Rain saw this, their gaze shifted as they snorted, “you don’t know what’s good for you.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The sky instantly filled up with dense storm clouds. Fierce winds howled, followed by a sudden downpour.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The rapid rainfall quickly raised the surrounding river’s water level. It flowed over the dams, enveloping all the nearby farms.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The surging river water collapsed the buildings’ roofs. Soon, countless hideous river monsters appeared on its surface.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Go!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The river monsters floating on the water's surface leaped into the air. At the same time, the howling winds mixed with stone and debris made it hard for Heavenly King Li to even breathe.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The tower floating above his head dimmed but there was nothing he could do about it….</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Heavenly King Li’s injuries were too heavy. Forcibly activating the pagoda’s sixth floor was more than his body could bear right now.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Ol’ Li, don’t blame me.” Both the Count of Wind and Lord of Rain silently closed their eyes.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Lightning Breaks All Barriers!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>There was a sudden crack of lightning. Before the sound of thunder reached their ears, they saw the God of Thunder, his body bathed in brilliant lightning. He hefted his hammer and struck forth.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A bolt of lightning shot towards one of the monsters, scattering it. Then they saw a bright-red silken belt cut into the surrounding monsters.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Splash! Splash! Splash!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The monsters, which were formed of pure river water, instantly turned to beads of water and sunk into the river’s surface. Third Prince Nezha stood on his wind and fire feels, braving the wind and rain. He placed himself directly in front of Heavenly King Li, shielding him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When his gaze fell on Heavenly King’s severed arm, his youthful face instantly grew malevolent.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“All of you deserve death! Universe Ring, get them!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He reached forward and the ring always wore shot forth, mixed with origin power, and hurtled towards the Count of Wind and Duke of Rain.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Hmph.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Off in the distance, the pair snorted simultaneously. The Universe Ring was a primordial divine artifact capable of destroying anything. They knew they were capable of defending against it so they dared not hesitate; they hurried out of its path, just barely managing to dodge.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, the flying ring twisted around and turned back, slamming into the Count of Wind’s back.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Cough.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As it collided with his back, Count felt a hint of sweetness in the back of his throat. Soon, he couldn’t stop himself from coughing up a mouthful of fresh blood.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Lord of Wind was about to go help when the space before him crackled with a sudden bolt of lightning. He panicked and instinctively hurried out of its path. He dodged to the side, only to see that the God of Thunder had already reached Li Jing.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I knew it! I knew you people were up to no good!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Origin Ring had already achieved a favorable result. It ceased its attacks and returned to Nezha’s hand.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Dad.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Nezha glowered hatefully at the Count of Wind and Lord of Rain before hurriedly taking out a medicinal pill and placing it into Li Jing’s mouth.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It was then that the God of Thunder noticed his severed arm for the first time. Sparks practically flew from his eyes as he roared, “Count of Wind! Lord of Rain! You’ve really got guts! I’ve already reported to the palace. You just sit tight and wait to die!” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Haha…..” the Count of Wind, who’d just endured the Origin Ring’s attack, laughed wantonly. “I’m afraid not even the palace you trust so much can help you now!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>…..</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At the Cloudy Palace of the Golden Arches.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The North Pole Emperor sat on the Jade Emperor’s former throne, expression grave.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Most of the higher immortals were currently present in the palace. However, that only went for the civil officials. The warriors and generals were absent. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Emperor,” said the God of Fortune after putting down his cellphone, “the God of Thunder and the others were ambushed as well.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As soon as the God of Fortune finished his sentence, the North Pole Emperor’s hands slammed into the arms of his throne.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>They shattered into pieces.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The emperor gnashed his teeth furiously and shouted, “they didn’t rebel when the Jade Emperor was here. Instead, they insisted on rebelling as soon as I took the throne? They’re just doing this to make me look bad. Just who the hell gave them the guts?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>His fury reached the heavens.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The officials were completely silent. They dared not speak.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I’ve truly got a good older brother, a good older brother…..”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He clenched his fists, cracking his knuckles.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Just an hour ago, the Western Heavenly Emperor of Supreme Polarity led his armies against the Heavenly Court. His soldiers were so strong, even the North Pole Emperor felt pressured.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The few warriors who’d stayed behind to protect the palace had already gone to meet the enemy. However, their results were deeply disappointing.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Reporting in! The Heavenly Emperor of Supreme Polarity’s men have already reached the sixth heaven.” &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Reporting in! The Heavenly Emperor of Supreme Polarity’s men have already reached the seventh heaven.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Reporting in! The Heavenly Emperor of Supreme Polarity’s men have already reached the eighth heaven.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>They’d received countless military reports. However, not one of them reported a victory. As he sat in the Cloudy Palace of the Golden Arches, the North Pole Emperor’s countenance grew increasingly somber.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Suddenly, someone viciously kicked the giant spiritual beasts guarding the gates right through the doors and into the hall.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>They soon saw a silver-haired man stride into the main hall, clad in thick armor and radiating dense killing intent. He carried the Canopy Marshall, who the North Pole Emperor had sent to meet the enemy. It was unclear whether the marshall was alive or dead.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As the man entered the room, the immortals’ pupils constricted.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“North Pole.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Supreme Polarity.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Sparks flew as the brothers’ eyes met.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Get down from there.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Heavenly Emperor of Supreme Polarity’s tone left no room for argument. He narrowed his eyes at the seated North Pole Emperor.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You don’t belong on that seat.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Then who does? Do you, brother?” asked the North Pole Emperor. His expression darkened as he said, “you congratulated me not long ago. To think that after such a short period of time, my own brother would lead his army against me. If you wanted the throne, why didn’t you say so? I would have given it to you.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Tch.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Heavenly Emperor of Supreme Polarity suddenly sneered in contempt. “You think I care about the Jade Emperor’s throne? Ridiculous. If I’d wanted the throne back then, would the Jade Emperor have even been qualified to compete with me?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“In that case, what did what you said earlier mean?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Heavenly Emperor of Supreme Polarity’s eyes twitched. Soon, they heard him say, “you don’t belong in that seat. Get down.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Aren’t you just interested in the throne after all?” A fierce light flashed through the North Pole Emperor’s eyes. “Take your people with you and scram. In light of our former brotherhood, I won’t pursue this matter.” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“North Pole, you ought to remember: everything you know about fighting, you learned from me. And now you want to threaten me?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Heavenly Emperor of Supreme Polarity narrowed his eyes and laughed, “Threatening me? Do you really think you can threaten my army of three-hundred thousand elites with just these wounded soldiers and defeated generals?</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As he spoke, he hefted the Canopy Marshall into the air and flung him at the North Pole Emperor.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“He’s your subordinate. Here, I’ll return him to you.”&nbsp;</p>
