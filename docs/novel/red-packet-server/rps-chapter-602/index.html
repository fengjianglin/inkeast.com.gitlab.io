 <p><span style>Chapter 602 – Delay</span></p>
 <p><span style>Time seemed to stand still within the Demon Dragon palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Black Dragon’s expression seemed to have changed over ten times within a time of thirty seconds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little friend Ye, this joke isn’t funny at all,” Black Dragon maintained his warm smile, and looked towards Ye Zichen. “Don’t forget, this is the Demon Realm you’re in.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course I know that,” Ye Zichen shrugged. “But I really don’t know where the ley line is. I’ve been trying to contact the </span><i><span style>Yellow Emperor</span></i><span style> these past three days, but he’s been ignoring me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t blame me for not giving you a chance. Tell me! Where is the ley line!?” Black Dragon’s tone had already turned sullen. He stared at Ye Zichen, and tried to pressure him into saying it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I wouldn’t know even if you give me ten thousand more chances. Seriously, I’m not lying, I really don’t know where the ley line is!” Ye Zichen sighed. </span><i><span style>Why doesn’t anyone believe the truth these days. </span></i><span style>“How about giving me two more weeks, and let me try to see if I can contact the Yellow Emperor?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Someone come!” Black Dragon roared angrily. Two men amongst the Twelve Demon Sovereigns walked over, and grabbed hold of Ye Zichen. “Grant him death!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon had already lost all his patience, but he still wanted to make a final gamble.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In his opinion, everyone would choose to submit when faced with death. He wanted to use this way to get the information he wants from Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he was still going to be disappointed…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen truly didn’t know the location of the ley line.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A dark sphere of light had already appeared in the baldie’s hand. The sphere seemed to possess a bit of devouring ability, so several cracks appeared in the space around it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment, Su Yiyun stood up from his chair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone looked towards him. Ye Zichen’s eyes also twitched, and he began to wonder.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could it be that…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Master Su, what do you mean by this?” Black Dragon’s expression was still sullen. He was in a terrible mood as they have not yet located the ley line.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since Lord Black Dragon wants the ley line, killing him isn’t going to help with anything. In the end, you still wouldn’t find the location of the ley line,” Su Yiyun smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then is Master Su saying that I have to worship him? Heh, I’m not that sort of person,” Black Dragon squinted his eyes as he gave a cold laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm, Brother Su was university roommates with Ye Zichen in the Modern Realm, they were like brothers there. Brother Su, you should explain what you’re doing, right?” Gu Li smiled sinisterly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon also looked towards Su Yiyun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gu Li, what do you mean by that!? Su Yiyun is my man! He’s the formation master I brought over to the Demon Realm. What right do you have to randomly slander him!?” Li Min’e stood up angrily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, only Brother Su knows what he’s thinking. None of us can read minds. People all have their secrets. If Su Yiyun doesn’t want to save Ye Zichen, then why did he stop us from capturing the Yellow Emperor so many times, and even go as far as to plead mercy for him right now?” Gu Li smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>LI Min’e bit her lips, and walked beside Su Yiyun to grab his arm, “Su, tell them that you aren’t doing it to save him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who says I’m going to save him!?” Su Yiyun laughed coldly, then took out a sharp dagger. “Brother Bael killing him with a Darkness Devouring Sphere is being too nice to him. There is a torture technique called Lingering Death in the Modern Realm. It is one that involves slicing across his body using a small knife, causing him to be unable to die, yet feel pain that is beyond death. Perhaps, he might tell us the location of the ley line while begging us to kill him off. Isn’t that great for everyone? What’s more, even if he doesn’t say anything, and just bleeds to death, we don’t lose anything, and it’ll make us feel pretty good!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems like we are indeed too kind compared to Master Su,” Bael couldn’t help but shake his head with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I really didn’t think that Master Su had this up his sleeve,” Black Dragon smiled faintly. “Then we’ll do as Master Su said. If you please!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun nodded, then walked in front of Ye Zichen with the knife.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Ye Zichen’s spiritual energy was already sealed. He couldn’t use any spiritual techniques and couldn’t even summon his armor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He stared straight at Su Yiyun who was smiling devilishly, and watched on as Su Yiyun slapped the dagger against his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Meeting me is your misfortune!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ol’ Three!” Ye Zichen frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun slapped him and cursed, “Who’s your Ol’ Three!? Don’t try and curry favor with me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun pierced the dagger into Ye Zichen’s arm, causing a bit of blood to spurt out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen grit his teeth, while a huge droplet of sweat fell down from his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lord Black Dragon asked you about the location of the ley line. If you don’t want to suffer so much, then say it. That stab was merely the beginning, so consider properly,” Su Yiyun wiped the blood from the dagger on Ye Zichen’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked up at Su Yiyun, “I don’t know.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s strong, but that’s useless here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun stabbed into Ye Zichen’s arm once again, and it was the exact same place where the first stab was. The dualism of the pain was more than he could handle, causing him to scream out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re going to speak?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun maintained his coldness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the Demon Sovereigns felt a chill down their spine. They never expected Master Su, who was normally rather easy-going, to actually show such a vicious side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only Gu Li maintained his mocking smile of disdain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have no idea. Ahhh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Ye Zichen finished his response, Su Yiyun stabbed into his other arm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blood continuously flowed down Ye Zichen’s arms and down to the floor. Not long later, a pool had surfaced on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You sure you aren’t going to say it? I won’t pierce it into you where it’ll be critical. I’ll mess with you slowly. We have plenty of time to spend.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was already covered in sweat. It looked as if he was just dragged out of water. He panted heavily, while he glanced at Su Yiyun with his bloodshot eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Peh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen spat on Su Yiyun’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun wiped the saliva off his face darkly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Spit on me, spit on me. Try spitting on me again!” Su Yiyun stabbed into Ye Zichen’s thigh thrice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen opened his eyes wide and cried out in pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Bael couldn’t stand it anymore. The scene was too pitiful… “Master Su, let Old Bael end him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Back down!” Su Yiyun glared at him. ‘He actually dared to spit on me. Only by messing with him until he dies can I satiate my rage.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, just as he was about to stab down once more, a white-robed man appeared in the hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m here!”</span></p>
 <p></p>

 <p></p>
 <p><strong>Black Dragon:&nbsp;</strong>Thank... Wait, huh? You said you don't know?</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Yeah, I don't know.</p>
 <p><strong>Black Dragon:&nbsp;</strong>As the Yellow Emperor, you should remember where you sealed it!</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>I wish I remember, but I don't. I'm Ye Zichen. I might be the reincarnation of the Yellow Emperor, but I don't possess his memories at all.</p>
 <p><strong>Black Dragon:&nbsp;</strong>So you're going to remain stubborn and not tell me?</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>If you must interpret it that way, then yes. But the truth is... I really don't know.</p>
 <p><strong>Black Dragon:&nbsp;</strong>You... You... Off with your head!</p>
