 <p><span style>Chapter 248 – I Have a Bad Temper</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei couldn’t help but smile when she saw Ye Zichen’s look of surprise, causing her to slide her white fingers across his cheek, “No, I’m just expressing my mood out!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You scared me,” Ye Zichen let out a sigh of relief. </span><i><span style>I just chased Huo Da, that disaster away, if another one popped out, I seriously would have to use extreme methods.</span></i><span style> “Then what happened? Something happened with the medical company?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei was slightly stunned upon hearing that, causing her to turn Ye Zichen’s head with her hands to take several closer looks, “Are you really my little man? When did you become so smart?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s expression darkened. </span><i><span style>Was I really that dumb before? Was there really a need to have such a huge reaction when I asked that level of a question!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen held Xiao Yumei’s hand and smiled, “What happened with the medical company? Did a problem come up with the operational side?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There aren’t any issues with that. In fact, the market is actually unusually heated,” Xiao Yumei replied plainly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s good news!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>If the market has a high demand, it means that the company is earning money, it should be the cause of Xiao Yumei’s expression.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Since the market is big, there’s a lot of profits. When there’s a lot of profits, there are always going to be people that want a share…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So it’s like that!” A hint of smile appeared on Ye Zichen’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong dong dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Someone knocked on the office door. Not long after, Li Minghu walked into the office.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Director Xiao. Oh, Boss Ye is here too,” Li Minghu raised his eyebrows. Xiao Yumei and Ye Zichen both nodded towards him before they all sat down on the sofa.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tiger disturbed your business, right? Tiger apologizes to you right here, but I do have urgent matters to discuss with you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows. Meanwhile, Xiao Yumei revealed a troubled look beside him, as if she had already guessed Li Minghu’s purpose for coming over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ai, our special medicine sold really well in the market before, but for some reason, it just can’t be sold these past few days,” Li Minghu squinted his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked towards Xiao Yumei, and when he saw her expression, he couldn’t help but ask, “Yumei, do you know something?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm,” Xiao Yumei nodded. “It should be that Han family’s child, Han Qi!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who’s he?” Ye Zichen frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Minghu, who sat opposite him, was stunned, “Boss Ye, you don’t know Han Qi? Han Qi, the second young master of the Han family, which is part of the three great families of Bingcheng! If it really is him behind it all, then it is a bit troublesome.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong dong dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, someone knocked on the office door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Director Xiao, that guy came again,” Li Shuang frowned at the entrance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei also revealed a troubled look, “I understand, I’ll be right there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After her reply, Xiao Yumei couldn’t help but shake her head with a laugh, “Speak of the devil! Han Qi’s here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A young man, who had dyed his hair a wine red, sat on the sofa in the lobby of the medical company. The young man appeared like a delinquent with tattoos covering his arms and fingers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nobody could imagine that this young man was actually Han Qi, the second young master of Bingcheng’s Han family.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, girl, did you go and call your boss? I’ve been sitting here for nearly five minutes!” Hang Qi’s voice was slightly sharp, while his face was covered in an impatient expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why is Young Master Han so angry?” Xiao Yumei walked out with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Qi’s eyes lit up, then licked his lips, while he swept his greedy gaze over her, “Boss Xiao’s body is getting better and better, and your face is getting prettier!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I thank Young Master Han’s praise. I wonder what did Young Master Han come here for…” Xiao Yumei replied plainly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Does Director Xiao not know that I only have two purposes in coming here?” Han Qi smiled faintly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Han, I, Xiao Yumei, naturally welcome you if you want to invest in our medical company. However, buying shares with just one yuan seems a bit illogical, right?” A faint smile covered Xiao Yumei’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Logic is just for people. What’s more, when Director Xiao is with me in the future, isn’t the country going to be mine!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You would have to ask my man about that,” With that, Xiao Yumei hugged Ye Zichen’s arm sweetly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Qi had already noticed Ye Zichen from the get go, but he had thought that Ye Zichen was merely a business associate or a bodyguard etc…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh yeah, he’s also the real owner of this medical company!” The reason Xiao Yumei said this was due to Ye Zichen telling her to beforehand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She might not know how to handle these shameless bastards, but he did!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This grandson is Han Qi?” Ye Zichen laughed. Before seeing Han Qi in person, he thought the grandson was someone with a lot of talent.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He’s just a f*cking delinquent!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>And a delinquent with a rather low intelligence at that!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re cursing at me?” Han Qi frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded, “He’s not seriously dumb, at least he knows how to identify people talking about him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…” Han Qi pointed with his face full of darkness and rage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen merely whistled and shrugged in reaction, “Don’t point at me. I don’t have a great temper. Didn’t you hear Yumei say that this company is mine? If you want to invest, then speak properly to me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, grandson, you’ve overestimated yourself way too much, haven’t you?” Han Qi sneered. “I’ll give you two choices!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Say it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“One, I’ll force your company to close down and make you live the rest of your life in fear!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Two, hand the company over to me obediently. Make the woman beside you be with me until I get tired of her!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Qi reached out two fingers menacingly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Ye Zichen’s smiling face gradually turned dark… “I told you already. I have a bad temper!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen reached out towards Han Qi’s fingers!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck… You…” Han Qi’s face turned bright red as he glared at Ye Zichen like a bull. Then, he subconsciously reached out to point at Ye Zichen with his other finger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You seriously have a bad memory, don’t you? I said it already, I have a bad temper!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are f*cking seeking death!” Han Qi curled his body and shouted with a menacing gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen kicked him back, then stepped on him. Then, Ye Zichen put his hands into his pockets and smiled, “I don’t know whether I’m seeking death or not. I just know that if you dare to bullshit about anything else, then you won’t live long!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen kicked Han Qi to the revolving doors.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck off! If you dare to come here and act cocky again, I can’t guarantee that you’ll walk out alive.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandson, you’re good. Just f*cking wait, if laozi doesn’t kill you, laozi’s surname isn’t Han!” Han Qi’s eyes were filled with menace as he cursed as he held his arm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re not leaving?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows and smiled. Then, his gaze begun to sullen, while his hands remained in his pockets. “If you don’t want to leave, then just stay here forever!”</span></p>
