 <p><span style>Chapter 613 – Bloodthirsty Old Man</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This guy’s way too cowardly!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Luo Yang frowned. </span><i><span style>Man, Zuo Mo praised his guy so much in at the Zuo household. Seriously, you really need to take a look at things yourself to see the truth. I can’t believe he agreed to compensate the old man.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I can’t let Zuo Mo continue to be with him.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Also, what did that old man say just now? Leisure House only established through Treasure Tower’s support? Doesn’t that mean that this guy’s leeching off Zuo Mo…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luo Yang’s intimacy level decreased by 100. Current intimacy level: 0.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Intimacy level leveled down. Current intimacy level: Cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who was pondering how to mess with the old man, was momentarily stunned by the system notification. He looked towards Luo Yang in confusion and raised his eyebrows…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>How’d I piss him off?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh,” Luo Yang snorted coldly when he saw Ye Zichen’s gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The elder naturally noticed the hostile look Luo Yang gave Ye Zichen, which only caused him to start thinking again, “Then chief, please show your sincerity.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How would this old sir want me to express my sincerity?” Ye Zichen smirked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The old man raised a finger, “Ten million celeste.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ten million celeste. Zeze, that’s not quite the same as what I hoped for! How about twenty million?” Ye Zichen asked in a testing manner.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is there something wrong with this guy!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Luo Yang and the old man thought at the same time. </span><i><span style>He’s adding more to the amount himself!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, the old man didn’t care. The more he got compensated, the better.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since chief is so willing, then I won’t refuse. Twenty million. As long as the chief can give me that much, then I can promise you that I will not do anything to the people of Leisure House. In fact, I will even protect them when I see them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, the old man reached out his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen blinked and looked at his outstretched hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you doing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you mean? Of course I’m asking for the compensation,” the old man smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did Ye Zichen smile understandingly, “Oh, you thought that I was going to compensate you? You misunderstood, I was saying that you should compensate me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…” the old man’s expression stiffened. He squinted his eyes and frowned. “Chief, this isn’t a good joke.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who’s joking? I’m serious,” Ye Zichen smirked with a shrug. “Your words and actions just now have already severely wounded my weak little spirit. The twenty million celeste shall be your mental damage compensation for me. If you don’t compensate me…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Buzz.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A wave of spiritual energy spread out from Ye Zichen’s body. He tilted his head with a smile, while a golden aura swirled around him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then you can only leave your life here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s tone was firm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did Stone and Xue Qi smile in relief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the Ye Zichen they knew. They could not believe the weak actions that Ye Zichen had performed earlier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luo Yang was rather shocked by the sudden change in attitude, but he quickly smiled faintly.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Interesting.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, the old man’s expression turned completely terrible. He stared at the smiling young man in front of him with a menacing look.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I’m actually being threatened.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ever since he achieved the Sky Immortal level, the only threats that happened was him threatening others. Yet, he was actually being threatened by two young men.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The city lord’s son was rich and he couldn’t afford to offend someone equipped with an entire set of divine artifacts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the Leisure House’s chief in front of him was merely at the complete stage of the Human Immortal level. He wasn’t scared at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t blame me for not giving you a chance,” the elder snorted sinisterly at Ye Zichen. “Compensation was the most peaceful way to solve everything. As the chief of Leisure House, every single one of your actions affected how this faction is going to do. Don’t destroy everything in order to act like a hero.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let me return your exact words to you,” the golden aura around Ye Zichen became denser and an image of a dragon begun to coil around him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It isn’t easy to break through into the Sky Immortal level. Don’t make a mistake! Twenty million celeste might be a lot for others, but it shouldn’t be that hard to get for a person like you who managed to get into some fortunate situations!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brat, you must have a death wish!” the elder’s expression turned even darker, then reached his hand out towards Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment he reached out his hand, a fiery red figure appeared in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He felt his whole body smash against a wall. The old man looked up and saw that Luo Yang, the city lord’s son, standing in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I already told you very clearly that fighting was not permitted within the city. Did you ignore my words?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It was that brat…” the elder pointed towards Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately shrugged, “I didn’t make a move!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man smiled, “You hear that? He didn’t make a move, the one who did was you! Since you’ve repeatedly broke Maple City’s rules, you will have to come with me to the city lord manor!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luo Yang slowly walked forward with his lance in his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The old man, who was laying in the rubble of the destroyed wall, clenched his fist tightly…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is outrageous! Outrageous!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rampaging spiritual energy filled the area. The old man’s hair turned violet, while his eyes turned grey.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was rather surprised by the familiar change, causing him to shout out, “Be careful!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luo Yang instinctually sensed the danger, but it was already too late when he tried to defend himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Die!” the old man formed a claw with his right hand and scratched towards Luo Yang’s chest, ripping out a piece of flesh despite the latter wearing divine artifact armor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh,” Luo Yang grunted, then took a few steps backwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The old man stood up with an hunched back like a beast and stared at the piece of flesh in his hands, then licked his lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After that, he tossed the piece of flesh into his mouth under everybody’s gaze, causing his lips and teeth to be covered in blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All, so delicious,” the old man sucked his fingers, then his lips, cleaning up the blood. Then, he walk forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Become my dinner!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoosh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The old man disappeared from the area with a speed that surpassed even a Sky Immortal leveled master.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All Ye Zichen and Luo Yang could see was a black figure continuously move through a crowd of citizens.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Screams after screams rang out in Luo Yang’s ears. Then, the citizens standing where the black figure passed through all fell onto the ground like dried-up corpses.</span></p>
 <p><span style> “RUN!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The merchants all begun to scatter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luo Yang ignored his injuries…. “Stop!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had a responsibility to protect the citizens of the city as the city lord’s son. He could not allow the old man to continue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, the old man’s speed seemed to raise several times after absorbing the human blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He passed through the streets like a phantom…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang… Bang…</span></p>
 <p><span style>As more and more citizens fell onto the floor, Luo Yang clenched his fist and glared. “You animal!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A crimson blade of air shot towards the street and hit the old man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen walked over with a sinister look in his eyes, while carrying a huge blood-red scythe on his shoulders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s end it right here.”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Original Chapter Teaser:</strong>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Compensation... Compensation sounds nice!?</p>
 <p>Are you kidding me?</p>
 <p>How the hell is lil' sis Mo interested in him? This makes no sense. Why would she be interested in such a pussy?</p>
 <p>I expected a lot of responses, but... This was not what I expected at all. This is way too disappointing. I was even ready to kill this damn geezer and... He said that? What a joke.</p>
 <p>Ugh, I'll just stay around here for a bit just to make sure this geezer doesn't go insane and starts to kill people after getting the compensation. After that, I'm leaving. I'm not going to have anything to do with this coward, and I'm definitely telling this to Lil' Mo. She's definitely been tricked.</p>
