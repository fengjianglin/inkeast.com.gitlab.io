 <p><span style>Chapter 318 – You Should Help Them Lose Some Weight</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, Qi Cheng and Fatty Yin sat inside the police car together, while a policeman escorted them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qi Cheng continuously stared at Ye Zichen within the car as she licked her lips. Seeing that, Ye Zichen’s face turned as dark as charcoal.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Too shameless.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>The situation is already like this and she still isn’t f*cking giving up?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the fatty wrinkled his nose, “What’s that smell? Bro, do you smell the stench of a slut?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yin Qiong, shut your damn mouth,” Qi Cheng blushed in anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did Fatty Yin raise his eyebrows, “F*ck, you really are shameless. Why didn’t I notice it before? Slapping you a few times actually gave you an orgasm. No wonder there’s a stench. Your pants are all wet, aren’t they? Hurry up and go home to get your mom to help you get changed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yin Qiong, I told you to shut it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, why should I, Lord Fatty, shut it? You’re the slut, and not Lord Fatty. Lord Fatty isn’t contaminating the environment just by speaking. Look at these white teeth! Smell it, what nice breath!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fatty revealed his teeth as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen elbowed the fatty and told him to stop talking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the meaning behind the action completely changed in Qi Cheng’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This gege is so much better. Gege, I like you so much!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fatty, stop cursing her. I hope that you can hit it!” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright,” with that, the fatty stood up from his seat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, the police frowned, “Sit down. Where do you think this is? Sit down properly, otherwise, you’re in for a treat when we get to the station.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk, it’s as if you can lock me up. Dude, I’m Yin Qiong!” the fatty chuckled in disdain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The police officer did not reply, but merely sighed in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The police were in the worst spot possible in the capital. They might have to arrest those people they can’t afford to offend all the time. Even if you took those people to the station, it was merely a formality since they would just leave after a while.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>But apparently Captain Lin had a background as well. I wonder if she can subdue these military, governmental officials and rich second generations.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>When the police car arrived in the police station, Lin Xiyue said to the policemen beside her, “You guys are in charge of interrogating these two kids. I’m going to take a look at this one.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Captain Lin, these two kids definitely aren’t normal people, how can we…” the police revealed a troubled expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Xiyue frowned, “Don’t be afraid of the powerful. Do I need to teach you guys that? Just go when I say so, why so much bullshit!? If you don’t get anything, then contact their families to take them back. Do you really think that we can make them stay here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s true,” the other policemen sighed with a nod, then walked respectively into the fatty’s and Qi Cheng’s room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One policeman remained in front of Lin Xiyue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Xiyue frowned, “What are you standing here for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m going to interrogate the guy with captain!” the officer replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need, I’m enough,” with that, Lin Xiyue walked towards Ye Zichen’s room. Right before she entered, she glanced at the policeman. “Do not come in while I’m interrogating him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Lin Xiyue finally entered the room, the policeman raised his eyebrows and snickered, “Captain can’t have gotten interested in that guy, right? Zeze… This is huge news!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Xiyue threw her notebook onto the table with a lot of force, then slammed the table and snorted, “Name!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’re already so familiar… Seriously… Is trying to scare me like that fun?” Ye Zichen sighed helplessly. “Hurry up and release me from these handcuffs, it feels terrible.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir, please cooperate. We are merely police officer and criminal here,” Lin Xiyue answered seriously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, you really have no conscience. I didn’t do anything, and you’ve already determined me to be a criminal. Fine, fine, fine. I’m called Ye Zichen, I accept my punishment!” Ye Zichen said helplessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Haha.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Xiyue couldn’t help but snicker, then immediately nodded with a straight face, “Alright, Mr. Ye. Everything you say here will be used in court. Since you have accepted your punishment, then this case is solved. Due to the crime you commited being intentional assault, we will hand this case over to the court of justice after the victim’s injury report is out, and let the court pass a verdict.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slam.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Xiyue put away her notebook, then begun to walk out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen quickly stuck out his leg. Due to being caught unaware, Lin Xiyue fell towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Get up quickly, you’re suffocating me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen continuously stared at Lin Xiyue’s breasts, causing her to frantically get up…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I said it already, your boobs are too big. Hurry up and help them lose some weight. You nearly suffocated me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go and die!” Lin Xiyue punched Ye Zichen’s chest, then snorted. “You still aren’t acting properly after so long!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe,” Ye Zichen chuckled dumbly, then listed the handcuffs. “Hurry up and take these things off…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Xiyue rolled her eyes and unlocked the handcuffs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stood up from the chair, then stretched lazily, “Seriously, my entire body is sore. Oh yeah, why did you come over to the capital? Wasn’t your job going well over in Bingcheng?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My family told me to come back,” Lin Xiyue giggled. “You? Why did you come over to the capital? Did you cause enough trouble over in Bingcheng, so you decided to find another place to do the same?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You guessed it right!” Ye Zichen chuckled. “I was merely following Officer Lin’s footsteps. I’ll cause trouble wherever you are. Only then can you get promoted and not lose your job!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So, you did it for me?” Lin Xiyue snickered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm, you can put it that way. I’m just a person that is super thoughtful for someone,” Ye Zichen nodded with certainty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since they were old friends, Ye Zichen naturally had plenty of things to chat about with her after seeing her in another place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After they chatted for a good half an hour or so, Ye Zichen pursed his lips and sat on the chair, while he placed his feet on the table, “How’s it going with your boyfriend?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Him?” Lin Xiyue, who leaned on the interrogation desk suddenly stiffened, then smiled faintly. “We’re about to get engaged!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yo, this is great news!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he spoke, Ye Zichen fumbled around his pockets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, he scratched his head in embarrassment, “I didn’t bring my chequebook. How about you give me your WeChat? I’ll give you a huge red packet and use that as my present for you two!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can I interpret that as the way of you tricking me for my WeChat?’ Lin Xiyue smiled with a hint of playfulness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though Ye Zichen did not have that intention, in order to my their conversation more interesting, he put on a look as if he was found out, but was still denying it, “No way, I’m such a proper person.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, I’m just teasing you,” Lin Xiyue’s face was full of smiles when she chatted with Ye Zichen. However, when she thought of that person…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Actually, I don’t want to get engaged to him. I’m… regretting it!”</span></p>
