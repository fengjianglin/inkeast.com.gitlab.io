 <p><span style>Chapter 327 – Living to Eat</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen desperately wanted to go to the Gu household.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The mystery of his identity had always bothered him. What’s more, when Mother Ye mentioned the Gu family, she had avoided the topic together, while she kept silent during any talk of his biological father.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Man Lin had also mentioned the… true meaning of his name.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a mystery that can only be solved after going to the Gu household.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why is Brother Ye in such a hurry to go to the Gu household? It’s better to go to that sort of shithole later,” Gu Tian said with a faintly smile and shrugged. “I finally managed to get away, so I was going to mess around outside for a few days first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You really aren’t interested in the junior family head position at all!” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Tian shrugged, “I said it already, I don’t actually have very much ambition for the position of the junior family head. Everything was forced onto me by the situation. There’s no helping it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since you’re so disinterested, then I don’t have anything to say.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though Ye Zichen was desperate to go to the Gu household, since Gu Tian did not invite him over, then he couldn’t be so straightforward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He could not let anyone know about his true intentions for going to the Gu household, so everything had to be done secretly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, Brother Ye seems to care about it even more than me. Gu Tian is truly moved!” A smiled filled Gu Tian’s face. “Originally, I had wanted to tell Brother Ye to come a few days later. I didn’t think that Brother Ye would actually come on the day right after the call. Gu Tian will definitely not forget this favor!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t say such pointless stuff. What do you want to do if not go back?” Ye Zichen squinted his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course I want to go out and play,” Gu Tian laughed. “My head’s about to explode just from listening to those old bastards blabber these few days. I heard that there’s a crowd over at Lihe Garden. Let’s go over to take a look.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen subconsciously looked over towards Lu Lu, who blinked her cute eyes and muttered, “Go if you want, I’ll just follow you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Tian stealthily gave Ye Zichen a thumbs up. Gu Tian had already known that Ye Zichen had plenty of girls around him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The one in front of him was clearly a new one. </span><i><span style>The fact that Brother Ye could actually make such a cute girl so submissive…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>His ability in picking up girls was definitely top notch.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen ignored Gu Tian’s actions, smiled towards Lu Lu, then rubbed her head, “You truly have no opinions for yourself at all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I just like following you,” Lu Lu tiled her head and giggled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then let’s go and take a look!” Ye Zichen said to Gu Tian, since he had nothing better to do at all. “I’m telling you, this is my first time in the capital, so you have to be a proper tour guide.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, Brother Ye, just wait and see!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The capital’s traffic was even worse than Bingcheng’s, so when they arrived at Lihe Garden, it was already midday.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After getting out of the car, Ye Zichen nodded as he looked at the classical structures, “This place isn’t bad at all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha, Brother Ye will definitely be shocked after we go in,” Gu Tian said with a faint smile, and took Ye Zichen towards the entrance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, a loud shout sounded out, “Hurry up and f*ck off. You cannot enter without a membership card.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“On what grounds are you not letting me in! Doesn’t it say that there is free food at noon here!? I already found out. If you aren’t letting me in, then I’m going to file a complaint against you guys!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen glanced over at the place of the argument and saw a young man with his back towards him. The young man wore a white-checkered shirt, and two strands of hair stood up on his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Opposite the young man was a security guards with an extremely displeased expression, what’s more, the security guard’s thick arm clearly showed how much explosiveness the guard’s body had.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brat, you leaving?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You guys are too mean,” the checkered shirted young man frowned, reached out with his right hand, grabbed the security guard and threw him out. “Someone that can stop this lord from eating isn’t born yet!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, the checker shirted young man ran into Lihe Garden excitedly, while shouting, “Time to eat good food.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen and co. were completely speechless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Tian also shook his head in amazement, “This rash kid. He’ll definitely be thrown out in a while.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as he said, the sound of fighting could be heard from within Lihe Garden half a minute later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The checker shirted teenager was being chased around by seven or eight security guards. The young man was holding a piece of bread in his mouth, while holding a piece of cake in his hands, as he continuously evaded capture.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, since two hands could not defeat four, the young man was finally caught and thrown out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite that, as he landed on the floor, the young man still carefully protected the cake in his hands, and muttered…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can’t waste food.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s face was filled with speechlessness at the familiar scene. The young man was truly too similar to a person he knows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s stop looking and go,” Gu Tian smiled faintly. </span><i><span style>It really is a rare occurrence to see this sort of weirdo in Lihe Garden.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But just watching when there was a commotion was enough. There was no need to do that now everything has ended.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Kind shopkeeper!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, a call sounded out behind Ye Zichen and co.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As they turned their heads back, they saw the young man with a checkered shirt ran over with cake in his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kind shopkeeper, it really is you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>No wonder, how could there be someone so similar to that weirdo I know. After everything, they are the very same person.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Gou Yuzhan, why did you come over to the capital?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kind shopkeeper, why did you come to the capital too? Since you aren’t watching over the supermarket, what if people steal all the food!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In Gou Yuzhan’s mind, food was more important than anything!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Ye, you can’t actually know him, right?” Gu Tian looked at the weirdo who just fought with the security guards of Linhe Garden over food…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah!” Ye Zichen smiled helplessly. “Let’s bring him along!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then… Alright!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Tian’s put on a troubled expression. He had just wanted to tell Ye Zichen that even if they wanted to take him in, it would be very difficult.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they arrived at the entrance to, Gu Tian took out a platinum membership card and handed it over, “I want to enter. A platinum membership can bring three people in, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir, that’s right,” the receptionist smiled, but when he saw Gou Yuzhan, who stood behind Gu Tian, his face instantly froze. “He… can’t enter!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That brat had been the nightmare of Linhe Garden in recent days. </span><i><span style>Today wasn’t the first time he came to grab food from Linhe Garden.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>He came the last few days as well!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>He’s already blacklisted now!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Why aren’t you letting me? It was logical since I didn’t have a membership card, but now my friend has a card, why are you still not letting me in!?” Gou Yuzhan opened his eyes wide in annoyance. “This is truly bullying. I’m going to say it bluntly right now. If you guys don’t let me in, then I’ll trash your damn garden!</span></p>

 <p><b>Gu Tian:&nbsp;</b>Gu household? Why are we going to that shit-hole?</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Where else are we supposed to go? Don't tell me you go out and around?</p>
 <p><strong>Gu Tian:&nbsp;</strong>Of course, how'd you know?</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>You're serious?</p>
 <p><strong>Gu Tian:&nbsp;</strong>Definitely. I'm so sick and tired of those geezers blabbering on and on about crap. Man, life outside that shit hole is amazing, there's no way I'm going to hurry back.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>... It's like you really don't care about that position at all.</p>
 <p><strong>Gu Tian:&nbsp;</strong>Oh, it's that obvious? Honestly, if it wasn't for me knowing that my brothers would eat me alive if I don't show my own capabilities, I wouldn't give a rat's ass about the election. After all, it's not like being in that shit hole 24/7 is my goal in life. I'm far more interested in everything else outside that shitty place.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>...</p>
 <p><strong>Gu Tian:&nbsp;</strong>Now, c'mon, let's go and grab a drink. I know just the perfect place!</p>
