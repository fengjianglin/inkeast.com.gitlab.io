 <p><span style>Chapter 129 – Adding lifespan, is that possible!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within the emergency operation room of the First People’s Hospital.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the pacemaker lost all its use, and when the wave on the monitor turned into a straight line, everyone in the emergency room turned silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to know who pulled the silver needle from this girl’s body,” Elder Deng’s expression was black as he scanned everyone in the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is no one going to own up?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The atmosphere turned even more tense. After a long while, Wu Deyou walked forward tremblingly, “Elder Deng, it was me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great,” Deng Cheng nodded towards him and said. “The only reason this girl could hang on was because of that silver needle, you did great…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Elder Deng, I…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need to say anything to me, go and explain it to her family members.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, the lights in the operation room dimmed down, while Elder Zheng walked out from the operation room first.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zu Siliang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rushed to the outside of the emergency room with red eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zu Siliang’s instantly lowered his worrying face when he saw Ye Zichen, “Sorry…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen directly punched Zu Siliang’s face with enough force to cause blood to gush out of his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry, you only know how to say sorry. Just what can you do?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Creak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The door to the operation room opened, and Elder Deng walked out from within.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The face of this titan-class person was filled with depression since the operation failed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was already prepared to endure the curses of the family’s members, but when he lifted his head, he saw hope instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Ye.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked up and saw Deng Cheng’s surprised expression.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This geezer was truly unfortunate.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>If this continues, then his title of being a genius might get ruined.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your operation failed, right?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows and walked in front of Deng Cheng. “With your medical ability, you shouldn’t have made that sort of low-leveled mistake. Tell me, who was it that pulled my silver needle out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The person who did the acupuncture was you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Deng Cheng’s eyelids jumped. He had taken a look at the acupuncture therapy when Yang Yushi was brought over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nine Yang Life Continuation Acupuncture Therapy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was an acupuncture therapy that he had only seen in medical books.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the time, he had wondered which master performed it, he didn’t think that it was actually this young fellow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you think?” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes. “Just who pulled it out!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Wu Deyou also walked out of the operation room with a tremble. When Deng Cheng glanced over at him, Ye Zichen immediately understood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Supervisor Wu.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Deyou and Ye Zichen had a small grudge, causing his eye to jump a bit when they met.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are the patient’s family member?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am the person that did the acupuncture!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s eyes reddened, then immediately punched his nose.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As blood flowed out down from Wu Deyou’s nose, Ye Zichen glared at him and cursed, “You don’t know shit, you’re just a doctor that knows about ‘unspoken rules’, I’m telling you, Wu Deyou I’m not done with you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen turned around and walked towards the operation room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Under Elder Deng’s signal, none of the hospital staff blocked Ye Zichen’s path. Right before he entered the operation room, he turned around and shouted at Zu Siliang, “Do what you should do!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood!” Zu Siliang nodded, then walked towards Wu Deyou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Deyou’s legs weakened and kneeled onto the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He understood. His future was over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen walked into the operation room, he saw that the situation was different from that of Elder Su’s. He didn’t see Yang Yushi’s soul within the operation room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You finally came, I waited for you for a long time,” White Impermanence suddenly popped out form the wall. She should have reaped Yang Yushi’s soul ages ago, but Ye Zichen told her to wait, and she wanted to see him quite a bit, so she didn’t do anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yang Yushi’s soul…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s still within her body, I didn’t start to reap it yet,” White Impermanence said softly. Of course, Ye Zichen could not tell whether she was smiling or not since she wore a large white hat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Her time is up?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm,” White Impermanence nodded. “I already checked the Book of Life and Death before coming here. Her lifespan is indeed up.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Lifespan is up.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>This meant that she was fated to get into this trouble.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen swore silently in his heart,</span><i><span style> if it wasn’t because that piece of crap, Zu Siliang, couldn’t protect the silver needle; if Wu Deyou didn’t touch it like a bitch, she wouldn’t have ended up like this.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He could ask from the Great Sage for Peaches of Immortality to lengthen someone’s life, but he needed Nine Soul Reincarnation Pills from Old Lord Taishang for a deceased soul.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Great Sage was already, but Old Lord Taishang…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Their relationship was truly tense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang: King Qinguang has returned safely. Thank you.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Beautiful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked up at White Impermanence, “King Qinguang has returned to the Underworld. Don’t reap the soul, just stay with me here for a bit, this person will have a longer lifespan later.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“King Qinguang returned?” White Impermanence was shocked. “You really saved him!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen already stopped talking to her, and instead started chatting with King Chujiang concentratedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to speak to King Qinguang.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After King Chujiang replied, another message appeared in the chat not long later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am King Qinguang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am the person that aided you in returning to the Underworld!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within the first hall of the Underworld, King Qinguang looked at King Chujiang as he looked at the message on the phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big bro, this person did contact me and said that he can help you out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thinking back to what Erlang Shen had said to him at the South Heaven Gate in the Heavenly Court. King Qinguang’s expression tensed up, then replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You and Erlang Shen…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I told Erlang Shen to release you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen deliberately replied in a cold manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you so much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Qinguang definitely said it sincerely. Although the Heavenly Court didn’t manage to get any dirt on him, if Heavenly Court really wanted to lock him up for several hundred years…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He really couldn’t do anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Especially when the Heavenly Court and the Underworld were in a very tense relationship. If he became the fuse and the two sides fought…</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>Recently Kṣitigarbha <a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> was in closed door cultivation, while the Great Sacred Emperor Equaling Heaven and the Ghost Emperors of the Five Directions were also in closed door cultivation.</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>Since he was in charge of the Underworld right now, if something really happened while he was in charge…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he would be in huge trouble.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need to use excessive words of thanks.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen deliberately portrayed himself to be colder and more mysterious. Meanwhile, King Qinguang also felt a sense of awe when he saw the reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood, I wonder if you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I need you to help me out right now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please speak.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Qinguang and King Chujiang were unsure of who exactly the other person was, especially since he had such close ties in the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They really didn’t dare to act arrogantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who is in charge of the mortal realm’s Book of Life and Death in the Underworld?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That would be me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good.” Ye Zichen made up his mind, “I need you to add a bit of lifespan for a mortal in the mortal realm, is that possible?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Add lifespan?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Qinguang was surprised, this was a situation that hadn’t appeared in the Underworld for at least ten thousand years.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, add lifespan, I’m just asking you if that’s possible!”</span></p>
