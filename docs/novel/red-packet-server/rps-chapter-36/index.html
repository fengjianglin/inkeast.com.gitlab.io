 <p><span style>Chapter 36 – Lil’ White, the Eliminated Puppy</span></p>
 <p><span style>Invitation to a team.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen picked up his lemon juice and sipped, but he didn’t shake hands with Jing Wan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Miss Jing Wan, don’t be so anxious, okay? We haven’t talked about anything yet, isn’t a bit rushed, just inviting me into your team like that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you need?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What can you give me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pursed his lips and smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A monthly salary of a hundred thousand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Wan clenched her first, but Ye Zichen merely shrugged with disdain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A monthly salary of a hundred thousand was a huge amount of money for an university student that did not leave school.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even for those seniors that had just left school, they would try their hardest to get the job if they saw a job that came with a monthly salary of a hundred thousand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen reached out his finger and pointed at the Porsche 918 outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Miss Jing Wan, do you think I lack money?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>About this…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Wan’s confidence was lowered by a large portion when she saw that sportscar. Someone that can drive this sort of car definitely would not accept due to a hundred thousand yuan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke, who was on the side, also looked at the sportscar outside the window with her beautiful eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Riche Bro, that’s your car?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Riche Bro…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Wan’s expression darkened, if she knew that he was Riche Bro from the beginning, then she definitely wouldn’t have tried to sway him with the salary.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can definitely shine with your ability, allowing you to have thousands or even millions of fans supporting you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Wan then used the fame aspect of it, she felt like Ye Zichen might think about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Clap, clap, clap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen suddenly clapped his hands and said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Does anyone know me in this cold drinks store?”</span></p>
 <p><span style> “Riche Bro, I’m your fan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Riche Bro, do you have time tonight? I want to treat you to dinner.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Riche Bro…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shrugged towards Jing Wan with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you think I lack fame?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Wan’s pretty face instantly froze, the chips she could use for negotiation were only these two.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he shut her out on both.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke noticed Jing Wan’s expression, and instantly wanted Ye Zichen to consider it a bit more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen raised his head up and shook it with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Actually, from this short conversation, I could can feel the establishment of Miss Jing Wan’s team is merely a sudden perk of interest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, I did consider this matter very seriously.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Wan denied it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shrugged without replying, then knocked on the table with a laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style> “Then let me put it this way, do you have the large amount of funding needed to establish a team?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have quite a bit of savings from streaming these few years…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How much?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Around ten million.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style> “You want to establish a team with only around ten million. Don’t you think that’s rather childish? Have you not researched about the backgrounds of the teams in the competitions? Which one of them does not have powerful monetary backing? Your money is not even enough to get a few good teammates.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The funding needed at the start of establishing a team is the highest. You need to pay for the players’ salaries, you need to help them find a suitable base, you need teammates… Let me say this, ignoring that fact that you have no substitutes, did you even find all five team members?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I…” Jing Wan paused slightly. She truly had not thought about any of that. However, she, who didn’t want to submit, retorted. “I will find the team members as quick as possible, and I will hurry and find people who will want to invest for the funding.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That means everything that you had talked about were just empty promises, then why are you still talking about a team?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen quickly finished the glass of lemon juice, stood up and waved goodbye to Jing Wan and Xia Keke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry, I cannot accept your invitation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen truly did not want to get involved in this sort of activity. If he really joined a team, then his life will be completely tied to the team.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He would be able to shine anywhere with the deities’ WeChat group, there was no need for him to choose a relatively failing route.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Furthermore, what he said was for Jing Wan’s own good.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was good to be hot-blooded, but establishing a team with just hot-bloodedness…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Might cause her to lose everything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen did not want the money that this girl worked hard to earn all be lost there. Perhaps always thinking about money seemed a bit common.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Ye Zichen was a common person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he drove away, Jing Wan and Xia Keke stared dumbly as Ye Zichen’s car disappeared from their sights from within the cold drinks store.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A faint sadness appeared on Jing Wan’s delicate expression. Xia Keke comforted her by the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jing Wan, don’t mind what Ye Zichen said too much. He’s pretty nice normally, I don’t know what was wrong with him today.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Wan smiled, while the sadness in her heart disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Ye Zichen’s merciless criticism still sounded out in her ear, she didn’t mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What he said was true, I might really be too impulsive. I need to go back and consider it properly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm, but Jing Wan, if you still need team members, you can find me any time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Wan left the coffee shop after putting on the cap again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Jing Wan stood on the side and looked at the spot that Ye Zichen left from for a long time, Jing Wan clenched her fist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One day, I will make you agree.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Ye Zichen drove back to the mansion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Rong was blanking out in the courtyard. It was a good thing that her child had gone far, but she didn’t know why she was worried in her heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mom, why are you just standing here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Rong looked up. Then, when she saw the sportscar behind Ye Zichen, the worry on her face became even more obvious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Son, what exactly are you doing to get all this money? Mom is worried for you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mom, don’t you know what I’m like? I definitely wouldn’t touch those sort of bad things,” Ye Zichen grabbed Ye Rong’s shoulders and walked into the pavilion in the courtyard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The environment is rather nice here, it’s just that I’m not quite used to it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How come?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I feel quite empty inside. Back in the village, I could chat with your auntie and them, but now…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Rong stopped, while Ye Zichen also felt a bit sad.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As a son, he did his best to allow his mother to live a good life, but he didn’t have much time to accompany her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For some reason, Ye Zichen thought of the dog he got from the Howling Celestial Dog.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mom, wait a moment, let me give you a present.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen ran into the car and opened the WeChat Treasure Chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Eliminated Dog from the Celestial Dog Show</span></p>
 <p><span style>Withdraw.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A white and fluffy poodle appeared in Ye Zichen’s arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment the poodle appeared, it subconsciously checked out its surroundings first. When it saw Ye Zichen, it actually revealed an expression of disdain like a human.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little fellow, you’re with me now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Disdain, there was still disdain!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little fellow, you’re rather interesting,” Ye Zichen wanted to touch the poodle’s hair, but it raised its head and showed him its fangs, wearing a ferocious expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, even when dogs like poodles pretended to be ferocious, they still seemed very cute.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re rather fun, I’ll call you Lil’ White from now on.”</span></p>
