 <p><span style>Chapter 415 – Disbanded</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The patient’s situation has already stabilized. It was fortunate that you arrived in time. Otherwise, it is hard to say what might have happened.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan’s body was covered in pipes and detecting equipment within the ICU.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stood outside the door. When he heard Huang Shengmei’s reply, he finally stopped worrying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you so much. If it wasn’t for you, I really wouldn’t know what to do.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Shengmei merely smiled in response, “Why act so courteous with me? Oh yeah, you don’t look so good either. How about I help you do a checkup as well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He leaned on the wall outside the ward and looked caringly at Su Yan, who was within…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m fine. I’m so sorry for troubling you at such a late hour. Hurry up and rest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I already said not to be so courteous with me,” Huang Shengmei pursed her lips slightly helplessly. Then, she bit her lips and looked at Su Yan, who laid within the ward, and asked. “Is that girl… your girlfriend?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Huang Shengmei’s expression changed for a moment, but she still maintained a soft smile as she nodded, “What a beautiful girl. Mm, the most dangerous period is over, so you don’t need to worry too much. If there are any problems, then call me. Oh, there are also doctors on duty in the hospital.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright. I’ve troubled you,” Ye Zichen nodded slightly and sent Huang Shengmei off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Ye Zichen was about to enter the ward, hasty footsteps sounded out within the corridor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sighed when he saw the person who came…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s destined to come will always come.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Uncle Su…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Move.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Qihu pushed Ye Zichen away. Then, not long after entering the ward, he walked out again, then punched Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen caught the fist, took a step back and replied apologetically, “Sorry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I already told Lil’ Yan said she can’t be with you, she can’t be with you… Hehe, look at what happened to her now!” Su Qihu stared at Ye Zichen as he suppressed his anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen merely accepted everything silently, and did not even try to explain himself.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>There is no doubt. I did not protect Su Yan properly.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, you better wish that nothing happens to Lil’ Yan. Or else… I won’t let you off,” Su Qihu pushed Ye Zichen once again, directly sending him falling onto the ground. Then, he walked towards the nurse station…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where are you going?” Su Qilong grabbed him. Su Qihu looked back with a frown. “Of course I’m going to transfer Lil’ Yan to another hospital…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Transfer what at this hour? What’s more, is there any place in Bingcheng better than the First People’s Hospital?” Su Qilong said with a frown, then patted Su Qihu’s shoulders. “You need to calm down.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How am I supposed to calm down?” Su Qihu glared at Su Qilong and clenched his first. “Did you see how Lil’ Yan is? You’re telling me to calm down. How is it possible for me to!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Su Yan has already made it past the danger period. Waking up is just a matter of time…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What Ye Zichen got in response was another raging punch from Su Qihu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In order to not hurt Su Qihu, Ye Zichen intentionally deactivated Unbreakable Body, so the punch directly caused a hint of blood to flow out of Ye Zichen’s mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You still feel fine in speaking? If it wasn’t for you… If it wasn’t for you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry, sorry…” Ye Zichen continuously apologized.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Qihu clenched his fists as if he wanted to continue beating Ye Zichen…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Enough!” Su Qilong grabbed Su Qihu, who was already in a crazed mindset, and pushed him from behind. “Go to the smoking area and calm down. I’m going to speak with Lil’ Ye in private.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the enraged Su Qihu left the corridor, Su Qilong finally smiled softly and patted Ye Zichen’s shoulder, while also handing over a tissue from his pocket.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you,” Ye Zichen wiped away the bloodstain from his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Qilong let out a long sigh, “Don’t blame him. Su Yan is his baby. Right now, she’s unconscious in there, so his emotions are definitely going to run wild.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded and smiled, “I understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s good that you understand,” Su Qilong patted his shoulder. “Can you tell me just what exactly you guys went through? You actually…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>No response.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, it seems like you can’t talk about it,” Su Qilong smiled, then raised his eyebrows. “Then can you tell me have you seen Lil’ Yun recently…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The mention of Su Yiyun caused Ye Zichen’s expression to drastically change.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a long while, he finally calmed himself down and shook his head, “I haven’t seen him for a long time as well, but don’t worry. He’ll definitely be fine with his personality that isn’t willing to take losses.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah!” Su Qilong nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, in order to prevent Su Qilong from seeing him break down, Ye Zichen forced a smile, “I’ll let you guys take care of Su Yan. Uncle Qihu will definitely get very angry if I’m here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, leave it to us. Hurry up and get some rest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm,” Ye Zichen replied, then slowly walked out of the hospital.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment he walked out of the hospital door, tears began to flow uncontrollably from Ye Zichen’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This night…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Hello, I’m new. I’m called Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhang Rui: Ye Zichen, tell us your age. You came the latest out of everyone in the dorm. We’re just waiting for you to rank ourselves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: 19.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhu Yunbai: Wow, in the end, I’m still the youngest. Why!?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun: F*ck, you bullied my bro! Do you think that you’re amazing because you’re rich? In times of richness, laozi’s comparable to eighty of you!</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun: Hey, don’t try to screw me over. We’re going dutch!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Yu: The phrase “the richer they are, then stingier they are” is talking about people like Ol’ Three.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kang Peng: Agreed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi, just give us a swift end!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen-ge, I was wrong…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“2016… Disbanded!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Creak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clenched his fist and trembled slightly. The scenes scorched into his mind would play the moment he closed his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Disbanded.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It really was disbanded.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ssss…</span></p>
 <p><span style>A set of quiet footsteps sounded out. When Ye Zichen looked up, he saw Wei Chen, who was wearing a black jacket, walks over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Ye.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen calmed himself down, rubbed his temples, then took out a cigarette to hold in his mouth with a sigh, “How are they?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“None of them received any serious injuries. Those little bastards would be good as new after a short rest,” Wei Chen smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After no long, there was finally a piece of good news for Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He nodded slightly, then clenched his fist, “You started hiring people over in the Three Realms, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I already sent messages to those old fellows I know. I should be getting a reply tomorrow morning,” Wei Chen replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good, recruit more strong ones. Even if its Sky Immortals, as long as he makes a request… I can satisfy him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem, I will hire them as quick as possible,” Wei Chen nodded slightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Ye Zichen also squinted his eyes and sighed in his heart. </span><i><span style>Since you said that it’s disbanded, then let it be disbanded!</span></i></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Original Chapter Teaser:</b>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Ye Zichen, Su Yan, Xia Keke, Wei Chen and the Tribulation members have finally escaped from the jaws of death. Since Su Yan was heavily injured, the group had no choice but to submit her to a hospital, but even then, she was still not safe.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, with his brothers dead, and the appearance of his acquaintance on the demon's side,&nbsp;Ye Zichen was overwhelmed with grief.</p>
 <p>Yet, life must move on. He had to drag himself out of this ever ending spiral of depression, but before he does that... He has to come to terms with what has happened...</p>
