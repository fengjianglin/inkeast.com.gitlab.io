 <p><span style>Chapter 238 – Had Enough</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Did not reincarnate just once!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at Lu Lu in shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she merely shrugged, “Why are you looking at me like that? I’m just speaking the truth. Back when you reincarnated into Zhang Junbao, there were two girls by your side who reincarnated with you, but all your attention was on me back then, so you ignored their very existence.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen twitched his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Ye Zichen was quick shocked initially, when he heard Lu Lu’s words later, he laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Be simpler, chat up strategies should be simpler…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who’s using a pickup strategy on you? I’m telling the truth,” Lu Lu bit her lower lip.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen maintained that expression of twitching his mouth, “Then tell me this, are the two girls that reincarnated with me pretty?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Although I don’t want to admit it, but they are indeed prettier than me. Especially that fox…” When Lu Lu replied, she clenched her fist tightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Towards this, Ye Zichen only…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Huehue!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Make it up, continue making it up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who’s making it up!” Lu Lu glared at him with a troubled look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You want to tell me that I chose to ignore two beauties and was so intent on following your ass around for suffering?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That was the case.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you think that I’m retarded? Or do you want to say that your charm is too great! Girl, I can believe that I am truly Zhang Sanfeng’s reincarnation and I admit that you’re Guo Xiang… But don’t treat me as an idiot, okay!” With that, Ye Zichen sighed helplessly. “It’s not my fault that the heavens gave me such a great aura that all sorts of beauties needs to use chat up strategies to catch my attention…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go and die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Lu bit her lips and punched Ye Zichen, giving him a panda eye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>History was always shockingly familiar…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen leaned back on the sofa as he used an egg to rub his eye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Ye, who beat you up like this? Tell me, I, Fatty, will go and take revenge for you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Fatty Jin rolled up his sleeves and held a kitchen knife as if he was going to take revenge for Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye ZIchen rolled his eyes in annoyance and kicked Fatty on his butt, “You? Go, there might be new meat at the butcher’s tomorrow morning. As for your kitchen knife, you’re just bringing a murder weapon for them!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, I’m just expressing my loyalty!” Third Fatty Jin smiled, then ran to the kitchen to put the kitchen knife back in its place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh yeah, why haven’t I seen Di Tian these few days?” Ye Zichen looked around the living room and frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Fatty Jin, who had returned from placing the kitchen knife, smiled, “Him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, he shouted loudly, “Di Tian!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The door to the bathroom was instantly pushed open. Di Tian walked out with a towel across his shoulder and a bottle of toilet cleaner in his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lord Fatty, you called?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen saw Di Tian’s grandson-like look and the bruises on his face…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It seems like he got beaten up quite a bit recently.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s not your Lord Fatty looking for you, the one looking for you is Boss Ye,” Third Fatty Jin shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Di Tian hurried ran over, “Boss Ye!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you used to living here recently?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, the brothers here are especially friendly with me,” Di Tian immediately nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“… Your words betray your heart as much as it is possible,” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes in annoyance. “I’m going to ask you something, if you can answer clearly, then you don’t need to do these tasks anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Ye, please sure!” Di Tian’s face instantly lit up. Recently, he had been tortured to no end by the fatty and the Hou brothers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you know about reincarnation and rebirth?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Di Tian revealed a confused look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen saw Di Tian’s expression, he knew that he asked the wrong person, “Go do what you should be doing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Ye, I haven’t heard about reincarnation and rebirth. How about you ask me something else? So things like how many families are among the hidden families or the internal situation of their families…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry up and go back, stop bothering me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Ye, aren’t those stuff what you want to know the most!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t want to know about those now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Di Tian seemed to want to try and gain another opportunity for himself, but Third Fatty Jin stood up from the sofa and glared…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Screw off!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Fatty Jin sat opposite Ye Zichen as Di Tian returned to the bathroom bitterly, “Boss, you want to know about reincarnation and rebirth?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You know?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Fatty Jin immediately revealed a proud expression, “Naturally, no matter what, I am Great Emperor Qingming’s inner disciple!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then do tell!” Ye Zichen smiled with interest.</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>Third Fatty Jin cleared his throat and begun, “About reincarnation<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>, it is mostly only achievable by some great people! For example you. You are…”</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Fatty Jin, who had a proud expression, was suddenly unable to speak. Not long later, his expression worsened as he kneeled down on the floor and continuously kowtowed, while muttering some undecipherable things.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just when Ye Zichen felt curious…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let things about reincarnation run its course. If you ask anymore, die!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>If there’s no surprise, then it’s that Great Emperor Qingming again!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s something wrong with you, right? Laozi can’t say anything, nor ask anything, do I f*cking live for you? Come out if you can, stop hiding there. See if I beat your teeth out!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that so? Then I’ll come.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The space in the room suddenly distorted. Not long later, a black gate opened from the ceiling, and a man with an average body, about 1.7 meters tall, wearing traditional Chinese clothing and a mask appeared in the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I heard that you wanted to see me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The space around him went still. Even Third Fatty Jin, who was kowtowing maintained his position and did not move at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re that Great Emperor Qingming!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unlike before, this time Ye Zichen did not submit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He truly was sick of submitting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The world that he knew got more and more mysterious, while more and more questions surfaced in his mind. At that moment, it was as if he was playing a game without any guides. The game continuously updated, and more new NPCs appeared alongside new main quests and side quests…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only difference was that a dead game character can revive and start over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But for this game of his, death is death. Thus, he couldn’t help but be cautious in order to pass the levels.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But he had had enough!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re in control of all this, right? I’m the lucky child you chose, right? Then I’ll tell you right now, I don’t want to play anymore, please go and find another lucky child, okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can’t endure it anymore already?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The mask man smiled. Hearing his playful laughter, Ye Zichen slapped the sofa and stood up, then stood fiercely opposite the masked man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, laozi has had enough! Laozi wants to live the life of a normal person, laozi doesn’t want to play anymore!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, I can feel that you’re furious,” the masked man laughed faintly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Only an idiot wouldn’t be furious. I’m telling you, I’m a f*cking normal person. I admit, when I got in contact with all this, I wanted to get rich silently. Now I’ll apologize to you. I was wrong, take everything from me, laozi doesn’t want them anymore!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But this isn’t up to you, nor is it up to me,” the masked man smiled. “This is all by your own choice, is it not? Yellow Emperor!”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Original Chapter Teaser:</b>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>I've had enough, I've had goddamn enough of all this! I didn't only reincarnate just once? What the heck is that supposed to mean?</p>
 <p><strong>Lu Lu:&nbsp;</strong>Yeah, there were two pretty girls that reincarnated into your life of Zhang Sanfeng with you.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>And I chose to follow you instead?</p>
 <p><em>Lu Lu nods.</em></p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>How pretty were they?</p>
 <p><strong>Lu Lu:&nbsp;</strong>I hate to admit it, but they were very pretty, at least as much as me.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Do you think I'm an idiot? You're telling me that I chose to follow you around instead of being with two cute girls.</p>
 <p><strong>Lu Lu:&nbsp;</strong>I'm absolutely serious!</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Oh god, why are you so unfair? Why did you have to make me so handsome that even the hottest of girls have to make up stories in order to talk to me!? I truly wish to be more normal!</p>

   <li><span id="footnote-1">To be more specific, the use of the word reincarnation previous and here (转世), is different from that of the reincarnation that is referred to normally (投胎). In terms of the latter, it refers to people dying and then being reborn through the cycle of rebirth. Despite the former meaning the same thing, it often carries the implication of the person/being choosing to reincarnate, as opposed to it being just something that a soul naturally goes through.<a href="#footnoteref-1" class="btn btn-sm btn-link"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></span></li>
