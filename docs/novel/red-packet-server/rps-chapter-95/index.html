 <p><span style>Chapter 95 – Confirmation of the Supermarket location</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun drove. His first thought when he heard about Ye Zichen’s thought of opening a supermarket was that it wasn’t going to work.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He did know about how mysterious Ye Zichen was. Ignoring everything else, he knew about the Great Recovery Pills.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he needed money, he could take out a few to sell in the upper class circles…</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was enough for him to live his entire life wealthily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi, why did you suddenly think about opening a supermarket?” Su Yiyun asked with a confused expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen licked his lips with a chuckle, “Isn’t it very normal for university students to start their own business? What? Are you not allowing me to open a supermarket?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s not that I’m not letting you, what isn’t possible with you. What’s more, starting off your business venture with a supermarket?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s wrong with that? Starting from the bottom…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It can’t be, you’re serious?” Su Yiyun thought that Su Yan was just kidding with him, but from the sounds of it, that didn’t seem like the case.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah,” Ye Zichen nodded in confirmation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then we looked at quite a few shops already. The ones I chose were places on business streets with a rather large flow of people. Quite a few were near the academy area, you aren’t interested in those?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The places Su Yiyun chose weren’t bad for a normal business, but Ye Zichen’s main purpose wasn’t to earn money with the supermarket.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wanted to sell items with an aim towards the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shook his head. Su Yiyun could only sigh helplessly and drive him to the next destination.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, what do you think? The shop is definitely big enough and you can store things underground,” a oily-faced fatty rubbed his hands and smiled towards Ye Zichen and Su Yiyun coyly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun frowned, then looked outside, “This place is too remote.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, it is, but the price is rather cheap.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think it isn’t bad. Ye-zi, what do you think?” Su Yiyun shook his head. If Ye Zichen opened a supermarket in this crappy place, it would definitely close down within three months.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think it’s pretty good. This is it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the location that Su Yiyun did not like was the one Ye Zichen chose.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This place was remote, but it was just to Ye Zichen’s liking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi, did I hear it wrong?” Su Yiyun opened his eyes wide.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shook his head with a smile, “Nope, I like this place. I’ll buy it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen wandered around the shop a few more times, then said to the fatty, “Did you bring the contract, let’s sign it now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun paid the fatty for Ye Zichen, then the fatty left happily with the contract and money.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Ye Zichen nodded at the shop with a look of satisfaction and a nod, Su YIyun walked over speechlessly, “Ye-zi, do you really want to open a supermarket here? You will definitely lose money in this crappy place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm, you don’t understand,” Ye Zichen clapped Su Yiyun’s shoulders and smiled. “I’ll give you the money for the shop later, I’m a bit tight on money right now. Also, no need to get the certification, just help me contact the suppliers, I’ll take… all sorts of snacks and drinks.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun instantly relaxed his tensed eyebrows and raised it, while holding Ye Zichen’s shoulders, “Ye-zi, tell me, what exactly do you want to do? You don’t want the certification and only want the supplies, I feel like there’s a huge issue with your supermarket.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not telling you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s phone rang as he laughed. He took a look at the caller ID and waved towards Su Yiyun, “I’ll trouble you for the supplies. I have other things to do, so I’ll leave first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There definitely wasn’t going to be an issue with Su Yiyun at the supermarket. But honestly, this place was really remote.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He sat on the side of the road dumbly for ten-odd minutes, then finally got a taxi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was very familiar with the path when he arrived at Huang Shengmei’s home once again, while Huang Yi rolled over in his wheelchair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Idol, you came.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Shengmei also walked over with a fruit plate and smiled towards Ye Zichen, “Zichen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t quite take the deep passion that wasn’t hidden in her eyes at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t be so courteous, didn’t you get me to come here to help Huang Yi treat his legs?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Idol, you can really treat my legs?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Excitement appeared in Huang Yi’s eyes. When Ye Zichen had just arrived, he didn’t pay much attention to Ye Zichen’s words since he was too excited from seeing his idol.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He only noticed a few days later that Ye Zichen had caused his numb legs to feel something when Ye Zichen had pressed down on his waist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t call me idol, it’s fine if you just call me Ye Zichen, or bro. I feel weird with you calling me idol.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay, Zichen-ge.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Yi nodded and let Huang Shengmei push him into the bedroom, while Ye Zichen followed behind them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you need my help?” Huang Shengmei stood beside the bed and asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shook his head with a smile, “No need, you can go busy yourself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Shengmei left the bedroom with a warm smile. Huang Yi, who was lying on the bed, coincidentally saw all of his older sister’s gentleness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen-ge, what is your relationship with my older sister?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Friends.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen put his hand onto Yang Meeting Acupoint on Huang Yi’s pelvis, while slowly applying qi into Huang Yi’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Yi merely continued to ask Ye Zichen as if he wasn’t paying attention to the situation of his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But I feel like the way my older sister looked at your just now wasn’t normal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that so? Endure the pain!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pressed outwards with his right hand, while the qi also flowed into the acupoint from his fingertips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Yi, who was chatting with Ye Zichen, suddenly cringed, then let out a terrible scream.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Yi’s situation was truly too severe. He was naturally limp and hadn’t felt anything in his legs since he was born.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason was because his nerves were completely blocked. If he wanted to recover, Ye Zichen could only open up his nerves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Instead of causing Huang Yi a little bit of pain at a time, Ye Zichen might as well cause him a huge deal of pain at once.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Yi screamed out in pain on the bed, while Ye Zichen patted his back and said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop screaming, tell me what your right leg feels.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It hurts,” Huang Yi was in so much pain that he was about to cry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Of course it hurts.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>If it didn’t, then his legs wouldn’t be in that condition.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Anything else…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It still hurts,” Huang Yi carefully felt the feeling from his right leg. However, he was stunned the moment he said it.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That’s not right!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>His leg shouldn’t feel anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen-ge,” Huang Yi quickly turned his head and looked at Ye Zichen in disbelief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t look at me. Endure it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen located an acupoint and pressed down again, causing Huang Yi’s bedroom to be filled with terrible screams once again in the next moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Shengmei, who was outside, clenched her fist. Her heart would hurt whenever there was a scream that arose from the bedroom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But more of it was anticipation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Huang Yi could feel pain, it means that Ye Zichen had a way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After an hour, Huang Yi was covered in sweat, as if he was just fished out of water.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen didn’t have it easy either, as his clothes were soaked in sweat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, my little brother…” Huang Shengmei looked at Huang Yi, who was lying on the bed, worriedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen painted as he sat on the floor and replied, “His situation is pretty good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then will he be able to stand up?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the issue that Huang Shengmei had always been worried about.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled and replied confidently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your affability level with Huang Shengmei increased by 10. Current affability level: 500.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your affability with Huang Shengmei levelled up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lover status confirmed.</span></p>
