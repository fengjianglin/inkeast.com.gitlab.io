 <p><span style>Chapter 292 – You’re Fired</span></p>
 <p><span style>Three days passed in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even after twenty-four hours, the ring on Ye Zichen’s hand still had no signs of falling. Thus, he had once asked Lil’ White how long it would take for the ring to recognize him as its master.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ White’s response was…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t know.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fortunately, people of Ye Zichen’s age would often wear some weird things, so the skull on the ring stuck on his hand did not attract too much attention.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if they saw it, they would just turn away after a single glance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Something worth mentioning was that Yang Yushi did end up becoming Maintaining Beauty’s spokesperson, which in turn caused the internet and television to be filled with Maintaining Beauty’s advertisements.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, the brand appeared in the northern parts of the country with an unstoppable force.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Maintaining Beauty headquarters were the tallest office building in Bingcheng. The huge Maintaining Beauty logo gave everyone the feeling of it being a large corporation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was very difficult to imagine that it took less than a month to establish everything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen drove to the Maintaining Beauty headquarters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir, excuse me…” The receptionist asked in a testing manner as she stopped Ye Zichen, who was about to get in the lift.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no other reason aside from the fact that the flowers in Ye Zichen’s hand were too dazzling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir, are you confessing to one of our colleagues? I personally encourage your action since girls like romance, but our company has regulations about how unrelated personnel are not allowed to go up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The girl spoke in a very roundabout manner, causing Ye Zichen to nod.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So your company has this sort of regulation,” Ye Zichen nodded understandingly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is because the higher-ups don’t want us to get distracted! There is no overtime in our company, work is work and rest is rest, so I feel like this sort of regulation is really good. But it does trouble you…” The girl replied with a smile. “How about you tell me who the flowers are for and I’ll send them over for you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiao Yumei!” Ye Zichen smiled faintly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiao Yumei…” The girl wrinkled her eyebrows. “What a familiar name!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiao Yumei is Director Xiao, the director of our company! It is clearly stated in corporate culture. Did you not participate in that during your training?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A suit-wearing man walked out from behind the girl. Ye Zichen glanced at his nametag.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maintaining Beauty International, Administration Supervisor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tan Zhengwen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Director Tan!” The girl immediately revealed a timid look on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Director Tan?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows, then looked at Tan Zhengwen meaningfully. “He’s just a supervisor, and not even a manager, but he’s already called director?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ve got problems with that?” Tan Zhengwen looked at Ye Zichen in disdain. “Recently, there have been plenty of people who sent flowers to Director Xiao, but they either own companies, or are of management levels in large companies. This is the first time I’ve seen someone so cheap.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you talking about me?” Ye Zichen pointed at himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You want to file a complaint about me? Sorry, I won’t give you the chance. As for who I’m talking about, think about it yourself,” Tan Zhengwen smiled in disdain. “if you truly want to pursue Director Xiao, at least get some good clothes. Even if you can’t afford real branded clothes, then buying some fakes to put up an image is fine too…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I smell the stench of money on you,” Ye Zichen smiled. “Maintaining Beauty International does not need a snob like you. Sorry, from this moment onwards, you are fired. Go to Finance to get three months of salary. Tell them Ye Zichen sent you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you joking?” Tan Zhengwen laughed like he heard a hilarious joke. “You’re going to fire me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The girl, who wanted to stop their argument, pondered a little when she heard the name “Ye Zichen”.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She remembered that when she first arrived, she had been really curious about why Director Xiao did not sit in the chairman’s office, and that office has been empty the entire time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once, she had heard some colleagues gossip about that. They said that they had once seen from the entrance of the room that the name stand on the desk said…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chairman of the Board - Ye Zichen!</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, the legal owner of the company was also Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tan Zhengwen, you’re fired!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Tan Zhengwen mocked Ye Zichen, Li Shuang, who was in business attire and heels, walked over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tan Zhengwen, who was laughing, suddenly stopped laughing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Secretary Li, what are you saying?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone in the company knew Li Shuang’s identity. She was the person that Xiao Yumei trusted most. It could be said that her status was merely below a single person in the entire company…</span></p>
 <p><span style>She could fire whoever she wants! Xiao Yumei definitely would not question it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re fired. Go to Finance to get your salary,” Li Shuang smiled faintly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What grounds are you firing me on!?” Tan Zhengwen roared. Although Maintaining Beauty International was just established, anyone could tell from the initial investments on the advertisements that Maintaining Beauty International’s future was immeasureable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although he was starting as a supervisor, he would be someone on the level of an elder later on…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He might even be able to compete for the assistant director position.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And more importantly, the salary at Maintaining Beauty was far higher than that of other companies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Ye said you’re fired, so you’re fired,” Li Shuang smiled, then began her introduction. “Maintaining Beauty International’s Chairman of the Board and legal person, Ye Zichen. He said that you’re fired, does he actually need a reason for that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Impossible!” Tan Zhengwen’s face was filled with disbelief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothing is impossible. You’re fired,” Ye Zichen smiled plainly, then clapped his hands. “Lil’ Hou, come over and bring this annoying thing away.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, the Hou brothers walked over in security uniforms in the Maintaining Beauty International’s lobby, and dragged Tan Zhengwen out by his arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After they took Tan Zhengwen away, Ye Zichen pointed at the girl, who was standing on the side, “Come over here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Shuang smiled understandingly when she saw the familiar scene.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I had gotten a raise just like that. </span></i><span style>Even at that very moment, Li Shuang was still very thankful towards her Boss Ye for giving her the chance back then.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now, she was able to buy apartments and cars with her own money…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everything started with that sentence from back then…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come over here…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Di-Director Ye,” the girl dipped her head as if she was a bit afraid. When she thought back to how much she said to the chairman back at the elevator…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m the chairman, doesn’t calling me director lower my status too much?” Ye Zichen chuckled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahhh, Chairman Ye,” the girl quickly corrected herself with her head lowered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you so nervous,” Ye Zichen patted her shoulders, then reached his hand towards her chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The girl was stunned. </span><i><span style>Is Chairman Ye going to molest me here?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>If Chairman Ye really grabs me, should I scream or should I endure it?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As the girl’s thoughts went all over the place, Ye Zichen used his finger to hook her nametag…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Administration Department: Gu Lüdan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Very good, Miss Gu Lüdan. From this point onwards, you are a supervisor of the administration department!” Ye Zichen smiled towards her.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Original Chapter Teaser:</b>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>My dearest diary,</p>
 <p>Today was another rather interesting day. Mu Chuang, the kid that Mr. Ye brought over to help Bai Dahai was left all alone there, so I had to go over and help him. But when I returned... Haha, the scene at the company was hilarious.</p>
 <p>That being said, it really did remind me of my past, and how thankful I am towards Mr. Ye. It was exactly the same with a money-worshiping person looking down on him, refusing to tend to him properly and saying mean and honestly terrible sounding things. He merely shrugs them off. Just like what happened with me, but instead of being in the position of the nice girl, I was the 'contact' who confirms Mr. Ye's position and basically hands off invisible slaps to ignorant person's face.</p>
 <p>Not only that, the girl ended up like me too. Well, rather similar. It was just a single sentence that changed her fate, promoting her to a much higher position, just like it had happened with me. Alas, I guess good deeds really do get rewarded.</p>
