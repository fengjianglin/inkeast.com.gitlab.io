 <p><span style>Chapter 241 – The Dazzling Lollipop</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Ye Zichen bought a set of skin care products, he immediately rushed back to his supermarket.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but sigh as he looked at the floor covered in dust. </span><i><span style>If Zhuge Kongming was here, the supermarket should be spotless right now.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I wonder how he is. I really do miss him a bit after not contacting him for so long.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>After Ye Zichen cleaned up the supermarket, his phone, which he placed at the cashier counter, rang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chang’e received your red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nameless, what are these things you just sent me?” Chang’s soft voice rang out in Ye Zichen’s mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He sat down on the chair at the cashier counter, and crossed his legs as he lit a cigarette for himself, “These are skin care products for you to remove the pimples!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Skin care products?” Chang’e was confused. This was the first time she had ever heard of something like that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, the green bottle of Anti-Acne Plant Essence for you to remove the things on your face. The rest of the rest like the Facial Cleansers are to wash your face and shrink pores. Didn’t I send you an instruction booklet as well? Just do as it says.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your intimacy level with Chang’e increased by 30, current intimacy level: 630.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your affability level with Chang’e increased by 100. Current affability level: 2115.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uhm, recently, Bunny… her spicy gluten…” Chang’e’s slightly hesitant sound transmission rang out in Ye Zichen’s mind. He scratched his head…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>No wonder, how is it possible to not get pimples when she eats spicy gluten like this!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Back then, he had sent enough portions to Chang’e for normal people to eat for an entire two months. It was finished in a mere few days.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fairy, although spicy gluten is delicious, you can’t eat too much. What’s more, since you got pimples now, if you eat even more, then you will only get more pimples.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s not me, it’s Bunny…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, alright, I get it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen took his phone with him and ran down to the basement storage to sent her all of the spicy gluten.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chang’e received your red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I thank you in place of Bunny.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Jade Bunny is truly great to take the blame. </span></i><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows and smiled. Just as he was about to start looking at his Moments…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shopkeeper, give me a lollipop…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We don’t sell stuff here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows. When he met the gaze of the customer… “Why is it you, brat!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You… Ghost… You…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person in front of Ye Zichen was the very young man that said that he had seen Ye Zichen die outside Jing Wan’s team’s base.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was looking for you!” The young man glared, then lifted his leg up and stepped on the cashier counter. “Look at my leg! When I got bitten by your dog, I had to spend two hundred something yuan for rabies vaccination! Compensate me with money!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen glanced at the young man. </span><i><span style>Although this brat had an otaku look, his leg hair is seriously…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Comparable to a porcupine.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s more, there are no bite marks on his leg either.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Dude, are you kidding me? Look at your leg hair. If my Lil’ White bites down on you, wouldn’t his mouth be pierced through? What’s more, do you have teeth marks on your leg? Or perhaps, where is your receipt for rabies vaccination, if you give it to me, then I’ll let you claim it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you think that I’m a porcupine!” The young man glared, then revealed a dark smile. “Don’t care about whether he bit me or not. Even if he didn’t, then the compensation for mental damage would be two hundred yuan. Hurry up and give it to me, if you don’t…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What if I don’t give it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then…” The young man’s dark expression instantly gazed upon the lollipop on the cashier counter with a heated gaze. “Give me a lollipop!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the hell...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen took one and held it out speechlessly, “You just want one?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Too dazzling…” The young man was fixated on that lollipop, as he continuously gulped and revealed signs of a struggle on his face. “If you give me the lollipop, then I won’t cause you any trouble!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Dazzling?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at that young man with a look of speechlessness, while the young man’s gaze was so heated that it felt like it was going to melt the lollipop in his hand.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is there a need to do so!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen felt the young man’s obsession for the lollipop, he really felt reluctant to tease him anymore, and thus, subconsciously handed the lollipop over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir, you’re such a great person,” the young man quickly snatched the lollipop over, unwrapped it, then stuffed it in his mouth. At the same time, he carefully returned the one yuan that he held tightly in his hand back into his pocket as he muttered vaguely. “I saved a huge amount again. I will be able to eat Xiao Ming Bun Store’s stuffed bun tomorrow morning.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s up with this bro? Is he in that much poverty?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>When he saw the young man suck on the lollipop with a look of bliss on his face, asked, “Bro, what are you called!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Me?” The young man was unwilling to take the lollipop out of his mouth even when speaking, causing him to reply blurrily. “I’m called Gou Yuzhan!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but stick out another lollipop when he felt the young man’s love for them, “Here’s another one for you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir…” Gou Yuzhan looked at the lollipop Ye Zichen handed over in shock. All of a sudden, he felt like Ye Zichen was wrapped in a sacred light… “How could I accept!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then, you don’t want…” Before Ye Zichen finished, he saw the lollipop in his hand appear in Gou Yuzhan’s hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he looked up, he saw the coy smile on Gou Yuzhan’s face…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I couldn’t control my hand!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Gou Yuzhan acted as if he wanted to return the lollipop, but his hand acted as if they truly refused to act as he commanded…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s fine, keep it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir, you’re truly…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gou Yuzhan looked at Ye Zichen with stars in his eyes. At that moment, little ghost girl Liu Qing stretched lazily as she came out of the dragon eye…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The lollipop in Gou Yuzhan’s hand slid down. Immediately after, he dived down to the floor and caught the lollipop before retreating quickly to the entrance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ghost… There’s a ghost…” Gou Yuzhan took out a silver cross from his pocket with a stutter and poked forward with it. At the same time, he shouted towards Ye Zichen. “Sir, hurry and run, there’s a ghost beside you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He raised his eyebrows and stood up from the cashier counter. Meanwhile, Liu Qing, who was beside him, writhed painfully as if she was dealt some major damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Put the silver cross away. Liu Qing, get in the dragon eye.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing instantly returned to the dragon eye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gou Yuzhan raised his eyebrows at Ye Zichen as if he was looking at a monster, “Sir, you…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen snatched the cross over, then activated the Fiery Eyes of Truth to examine it. After he noticed that there wasn’t anything strange to it, he chucked the cross back into Gou Yuzhan’s hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, he scanned Gou Yuzhan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only when the gold light faded did Ye Zichen slowly squat down, and raise his eyebrows at Gou Yuzhan, who revealed a look of terror and unease, but was still unwilling to let go of the lollipop in his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kid, I’m kind of curious about you now.”</span></p>
