 <p><span style>Chapter 247 – Level 4 Immortal Heart of Pure Yang</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen entered the Underworld’s staff chat, he was able to get the Azure Underworld Fruit, which was one of the necessary items needed to level Immortal Heart of Pure Yang to Level 4.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now, all he needed was a Hell’s Lotus in order to level it up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had searched for it in the Treasure Shop before, but it wasn’t there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you want a Hell’s Lotus for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing raised his eyebrows and replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen knew that geezer definitely had such a treasure when he saw the message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t care about that stuff so much. If you send me a Hell’s Lotus, then I’ll work for you. If you don’t, then I’ll leave the chat!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing’s teeth chattered in his frustration. He clearly knew that Ye Zichen was just scaring him, but he didn’t dare to place the bet.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>A person with nothing to lose has nothing to fear from someone with everything to lose… What if he really leaves the chat?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing clenched his teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled when he saw the red packet on the screen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received Taibai Jinxing’s red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hell’s Lotus x1.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The system has detected that Immortal Heart of Pure Yang is able to level up to Level 4. Would you like to level it up?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortal Heart of Pure Yang upgrade successful. Current Level: 4.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Daily Experience Gain x8.</span></p>
 <p><span style>False Spiritual Body (52/100).</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thanks, Taibai Jinxing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled in satisfaction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Taibai Jinxing’s face was covered in pain.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This was a treasure that I got from the Underworld ten thousand years ago. Since the Underworld and Heavenly Court have a really tense relationship right now, it could be said that this Hell’s Lotus is an extreme treasure.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It was taken away by Ye Zichen, the mortal, just like that.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>After a while, when Taibai Jinxing finally calmed himself down, he sent a message to Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have the treasure now, so you have to work properly for me. Tell me immediately whenever a situation comes up with the Underworld.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem. As long as I get the treasures, you’ll definitely get timely news from me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I hope so!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen arrived at Yu’s home at noon the next day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhang Lingling had already fused with her lost spiritual soul, causing her to reveal a strange color.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It seems like this girl didn’t lose any memories, including…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Ji Gongsheg!” Zhang Lingling screamed out in the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled completely and utterly helplessly, then shrugged, “Can you calm down for a moment? Let me introduce myself, I’m called Ye Zichen!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph, in my eyes, you’re Ji Gongsheng!” With that, Zhang Lingling leaned over, hugged Ye Zichen’s arm with her hands and leaned her cheek on his shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye…” Yu was completely dumbfounded when he saw this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked blankly at Zhang Lingling and Ye Zichen stick together, while a sharp dagger appeared in his hands, “Ye Zichen, I thank you a lot for helping Lingling find her spiritual soul, but what do you mean by this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…” Ye Zichen shrugged speechlessly. “Can’t you tell that I’m the victim here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhang Lingling stuck to Ye Zichen in her enjoyment. When she opened her eyes and saw the dagger in Yu’s hands, she immediately exclaimed, “Second Uncle, what are you doing! Don’t try to bully my Gongsheng!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhang Lingling used her petite body to block in front of Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu looked at the scene in surprise…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go and rest for a bit. Right now, you need to rest, I have some things to discuss with Yu.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t want to go!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry, do you want to see me angry?” Ye Zichen immediately frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, Zhang Lingling quickly patted Ye Zichen’s brows, “Don’t frown, I’ll just go!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Ye Zichen sent Zhang Lingling back to her bedroom, Yu, who was still standing dumbfounded in the living room spoke up, “Can you tell me just what is going on? Why is my niece so clingy towards you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re asking me, but who am I supposed to ask!?” Ye Zichen glared. “Your niece must have mistaken me for someone else.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Deal with the matter between yourselves by yourselves, I’m not getting involved.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, this uncle…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen took out a cigarette from his pocket and lit it for himself, before sitting down and crossing his legs, “How is Huo Da acting recently?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huo Da?” A strange expression surfaced in Yu’s face. “He went back to the capital in what seems to be a hurry!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled upon hearing that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If there was no surprise, then it should be the actions of the God of Fortune, which caused some threats to the Huo family’s economy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Going back to the capital is good. At least he won’t tell you to kill me every single day, making me live in fear,” Yu smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A hint of coldness surfaced on Yu’s face, ‘Actually… Huo Da had told me to kill you if I find the chance before he left!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A sharp dagger appeared in his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Say, am I going to succeed if I take action now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cough cough!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately coughed intensely due to choking on the smoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked vigilantly to the side. Feeling Ye Zichen’s nervousness, Yu shrugged, put away the dagger and smiled, “I’m just kidding. Don’t be nervous. The current me is unable to be of any threat towards you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your joke is truly terrible.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen left Yu’s place, he hurried towards Xiao Yumei’s medical company.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the amount of registration funds for the company was shocking, the company itself wasn’t very large.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen arrived at Xiao Yumei’s office, he directly pushed the door and entered without knocking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within the office, Xiao Yumei took sips of coffee as she stood by the window. She did not even notice Ye Zichen enter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yumei,” Ye Zichen called out softly by the door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Xiao Yumei turned around and revealed a forceful smile, “You came.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whenever she made such an expression, it meant that she reached some sort of annoyance, or some sort of trouble.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, I’ve missed you!” Ye Zichen walked next to Xiao Yumei with a smile. Then, he took over the cup of coffee in her hands and finished it. “It seems like you aren’t in the best of moods. Or is there some sort of trouble?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen placed the coffee cup back onto the desk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei smiled and asked in surprise, “You can tell?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s so surprising? Do you know what my eyes are? They’re the Fiery Eyes of Truth! There isn’t anything I can see or tell!” Ye Zichen pulled Xiao Yumei into his embrace and looked at her watery eyes. “Let me see, just what caused our Yumei to get so troubled.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then try,” Xiao Yumei smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen acted like a fake fortune teller as he moved his fingers and rolled his eyes, “Is our Yumei too pretty, and got too annoyed because of there being too many pursuers? Wow, if that really is the case, then I’m the one who should be troubled! I’m just a poor student who can’t compare with those successful people!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, they’re just a bunch of hypocritical dogs,” Xiao Yumei snorted with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Ye Zichen was stunned as he looked at her, “It can’t be, I really guessed it right?”</span></p>
