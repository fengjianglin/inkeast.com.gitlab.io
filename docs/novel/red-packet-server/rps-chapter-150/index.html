 <p><span style>Chapter 150 – How many reincarnations?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen scratched his head as he looked at Zhuge Kongming who had fled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, he didn’t speak about Xia Keke’s family, nor did he speak about his reason for coming there. He merely ran away after saying that he forgot to lock the supermarket door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why is that kid so bizarre?” Ye Zichen revealed a confused expression, then turned back to look towards Xia Keke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s insane. Just ignore him,” Xia Keke twitched her mouth. “How did you meet him? Don’t come contact with him very much from now on.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then contact his family to come and take him away, I do feel like it’s rather troublesome.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke spoke the truth, if Xia Keke could truly contact his family and take him away, then that would be so much help to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can’t help you with that at all,” Yet, Xia Keke not only did not help him, but dragged Su Yan to the roadside and left in a taxi.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the hell.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Laozi had spent so much effort and risked my life to save these two girls, yet they just left while I didn’t get anything.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Under normal situations, they would at least leap into his arms and sob a bit.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Also, he still didn’t explain about the Great Sage to them!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, what treasure was the passing thing just now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Great Sage couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows in confusion as he looked at the passing cars.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Ye Zichen felt a bit of a headache once again. He hadn’t handled this master yet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is the mode of transportation in this secret location. This is part of the mortal realm, they are unable to ride the clouds like the deities in the Heavenly Court. However, the people here are very intelligent, they managed to create this sort of technological item after several thousand years of civilization.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So that’s what it is. It’s just like the phone being introduced in the Heavenly Court recently.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, the Great Sage took out a thing that was similar to a modern phone from an unknown place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, more or less.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rumble.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s stomach rumbled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great Sage, when are you returning to the Heavenly Court?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before heading out to eat, Ye Zichen was going to sent this master away first.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I, Old Sun, am not going back. I, Old Sun think this secret location is pretty good, so I’m going to stay here for a while.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen felt a bit frantic, this lord wasn’t leaving.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, what’s with the expression that you have?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Great Sage scratched his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothin’…” Ye Zichen quickly sorted out his expression and revealed a faint smile. “This sovereign should naturally welcome the Great Sage for coming here. How about Great Sage letting this sovereign sort everything out for him while he’s here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need,” the Great Sage waved his hand without care. “I, Old Sun, have always travelled alone, and don’t trouble anyone wherever I go. With I, Old Sun’s ability, ha… There’s no need for bro to worry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck, </span></i><span style>if he really allowed this monkey to run all over the place, god knows what trouble this monkey will cause with his delinquent-like personality.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great Sage, just come with me. If you follow me, I promise you will have endless Wahahas.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that for real?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Great Sage’s eyes shimmered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Naturally!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I, Old Sun, will follow you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Great Sage nodded without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wahaha!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>That’s some good treasure!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Due to Ye Zichen being dressed poorly, he ran back to Di Tian’s mansion once again before they left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he returned to the mansion, everyone else in the mansion acted like a major enemy had arrived.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luckily for them, he only found a set of clothes and left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then took the Great Sage to a restaurant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The entire meal cost him several thousand yuan. It wasn’t because the restaurant was so expensive, it was because the Great Sage could eat so extremely much.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the meal, the Great Sage had continuously praised the food there, saying that the food was so much better than the food made by the Kitchen God and God of Food.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen didn’t know how those two deities would feel if they heard that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment they left the restaurant, the Great Sage couldn’t help but exclaim, “Bro, this secret location is truly a blessed place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s not bad.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen didn’t feel that, if it was him that was talking about the negatives of this place, he could say several hundreds of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, for someone like the Great Sage, who had never been in contact with this environment and didn’t know the troubles here, he would indeed feel like it’s pretty good.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh yeah, bro, I have always wanted to ask a question. What’s the little girl doing following you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he expected, the Great Sage could see Liu Qing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She-She is my little sister. She died before her time, I’m preparing to revive her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s really troublesome.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Great Sage clearly knew the method of revival. Ye Zichen was indeed troubled by the things needed for revival.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Great Sage was really capable in the Heavenly Court, he might…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great Sage, I wonder if you can help me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s hard,” the Great Sage frowned. “Everybody knows about my relationship with Old Lord Taishang. I, Old Sun, still bear the grudge of him refining me. As for the Eight Immortals, I, Old Sun, am not familiar with them. The only thing I seem to be able to help with is with Fairy Chang’e, but the Soul Pearl Yiyuan…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then never mind,” Ye Zichen felt rather disappointed. He had finally met a tough guy, but the person was unable to help.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh yeah, bro, I, Old Sun, am confused about one more thing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Say it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you not of a Celestial Spiritual Body!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s heart leaped.</span><i><span style> I can’t be found out here, right?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen squinted his eyes for a long while without saying anything, while Liu Qing also floated worriedly beside him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Great Sage scratched his face once again and chuckled as he looked at Ye Zichen, who had a troubled expression, “I, Old Sun, understand!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gulp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen gulped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, are you going through the cycle of reincarnation? Although I, Old Sun, don’t really like that geezer, Taibai Jinxing, but he definitely has a really high position in the Heavenly Court. The fact that you can live with him…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Phew.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen let out a sigh in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It was fortunate that this monkey wasn’t very bright.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Although Ye Zichen didn’t know what the cycle of reincarnation was, he’ll just get it over with first.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, this sovereign is indeed going through the cycle of reincarnation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, I, Old Sun, knew it! Do you dare to tell I, Old Sun, how many lives has it been?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>How would laozi know?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen revealed a troubled expression once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Great Sage squinted his eyes and pursed his lips in disdain, “You’re still not saying it? Petty. I, Old Sun, is merely curious about whether you’ve reached half a step towards being an Immortal King, or what. Never mind, I, Old Sun, will just not ask.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you, Great Sage, for understanding.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, but…” The Great Sage reached out his hand and licked his lips with his eyebrows raised. “I wonder when you can buy Wahaha for me, Old Sun. I, Old Sun, have waited here for a long time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll go to buy it for you now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen found a hotel for Great Sage Sun, then bought him ten-odd bottles of Wahaha.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before leaving, Ye Zichen had repeatedly reminded the Great Sage not to run around, and WeChat him if the Great Sage wanted to go anywhere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen finally settled the lord down, he wiped his sweat and left the hotel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, why did Sun Wukong come over here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing floated in midair, still in shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes and said in annoyance, “How would I even know!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen did feel a lot of headaches when the Great Sage randomly came over.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Someone from the Heavenly Court came to the mortal realm! Wasn’t this like a joke!</span></i></p>
