 <p><span style>Chapter 363- The Reason Why Divinity Couldn’t Descend</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian, the war god of the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was an incomparable existence for a hidden family like theirs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing Zhuge Kongming’s slightly curious and admiring gaze, Yang Jian raised his eyebrows proudly, “Little fellow, you’re right. Laozi is the number one war god of the Heavenly Court, Yang Jian!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The title of war god caused Ye Zichen to roll his eyes. </span><i><span style>If I remember correctly, he was beaten up by the monkey not so long ago.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Really?” Zhuge Kongming asked with blinking eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian’s body flashed. When he appeared in front of everyone once again, a silver armor had already been dressed on his body, while his lance rested in his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now you should believe me right? I only just descended recently. If your family worships me, then you should have seen it before,” Yang Jian smiled proudly. However, the moment he said that, he felt a hint of doubt in the eyes of the surrounding people. “What are you guys looking at me like this for? Laozi doesn’t have any spare effort to lie to you guys! If you don’t believe me, then you can ask my bro!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, no, no, great deity, we’re just wondering if you have truly let your divinity descend recently?” Gu Hai said carefully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian immediately nodded, “Of course, I care about my fans a lot. I have lived a troubled… Ahem, basically, I definitely care a lot about my worshippers. I normally descend my divinity about one every half a month!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But…” Gu Hai raised his eyebrows. “We haven’t seen the descension of your divinity for a hundred years. It isn’t just you, we haven’t seen the descension of any great deities from neither the Heavenly Court nor the Underworld.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How’s that possible!” Yang Jian was stunned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had been in poverty in the Heavenly Court for far too long, and relied on his worshippers to contribute either cultivation experience or reputation for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During his worst times, he had even descended his divinity every single day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, someone actually said that he had not done so, and they didn’t see the others from the Heavenly Court or the Underworld do so either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gu Family Head is right. We hidden families haven’t seen the descension of any divinity for nearly a hundred years,” Zhuge Hong also spoke up calmly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he heard that, Ye Zichen felt like there was more to the woman than what she displayed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She would remain composed at any time. On the other hand, even though Gu Hai was also the family head of a large family, they lowered their own status a lot when they saw Erlang Shen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even when they met people like the Black Impermanence intern, he also respected the person a lot, and the hierarchy was very clear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen never felt that from Zhuge Hong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as if these people from the Heavenly Court and the Underworld merely held an equal status to her, or perhaps, they held a lower one…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian didn’t mind Zhuge Hong’s tone as he was a rather laidback person. All he thought about at that moment was why wasn’t any descension of divinity.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck, each divinity descent cost quite a lot…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you have any altars worshipping me here?” Yang Jian frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Hai immediately nodded, “We naturally do, you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Take me there!” Yang Jian squinted his eyes and replied. He wanted to see just why did his divinity not descend. It was really for what he had spent before, since he was rich now and didn’t lack all the money spent before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he didn’t want his number of fans to drop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The divinity of a deity in the Heavenly Court was directly related to the number of their worshippers. If this continues, and his number of worshippers continued to drop, then even if he reaches the Sky Immortal level, he would only have the empty husk of one, and would not be able to use his strong prowess.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a while, the Gu family head brought the rather important people to the altar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian’s statue laid on top of the altar. The interiors of the hall itself was completely clean, while the smell of incense filled the place, and three incense sticks burned on the incense burner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great deity, look… I send someone to clean it approximately every three hours!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, Yang Jian’s gaze turned terrifyingly dark the moment he entered the hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Creak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian clenched his fist tightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, Gu Hai asked frantically, “Great deity, is there something wrong with the arrangement causing you to be unhappy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe…” a cold chuckle sounded out from Yang Jian’s mouth, as he pierced his war lance towards the statue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great deity!” Gu Hai revealed a look of shock, while Zhuge Hong’s expression finally changed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Destroying the statue of one’s altar was a huge crime. </span><i><span style>Just what caused him to be so furious?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The stone statue shattered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A black mist flew out from the statue, while mist swirled around the hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yang Jian, impressive, you actually noticed. Zeze, so pitiful, such frequent divinity descension were all absorbed by this sovereign.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Demon!” Yang Jian clenched his teeth. </span><i><span style>No wonder our worshippers were unable to see the descension of our divinity, it was probably cut off by this guy. </span></i><span style>“Stay here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A blinding hold light shot out from Yang Jian’s third eye, causing the mist to gradually turn pale, until it eventually disappeared from the hall. However, the playful laughter of the mist still echoed within, “So what if you make me stay? All of the hidden families of the Modern Realm have traces of this sovereign. Can you make us all stay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“At least you met laozi here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian stabbed his lance into the ground, and grabbed at the mist with his bare hands, causing a batch of black hair to appear in his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sssss.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A golden flame burnt the hair to crisp, while a playful cold laugh sounded out in the hall once again, “You’re pretty resolute. You actually directly destroyed it. I thought you will actually try to regain your lost divinity descension! Alright, since you noticed this sovereign, then there is no need for this sovereign to stay here anymore. This sovereign will take away all my incarnations from the other families. Of course… If you don’t believe me, you can try going around all the families.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Demon do you want to start a war with the Heavenly Court by doing this!?” Yang Jian replied resolutely, while he smashed his lance against the ground loudly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“War? Does the Heavenly Court even have that right?” the demon mocked with clear disdain in his voice. “Back when the Great War of Gods and Demons, who knows where the Heavenly Court was!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s cuz laozi wasn’t there!” Yang Jian looked up proudly and pointed his lance at the sky. “Laozi will beat up every single one of you demons I meet. If laozi had been there back then, then you demons might actually be extinct now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop lying,” the demon said in disdain. “With your level, back when we demons were at our peak, even the weakest soldiers could squish you to death!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, shock filled Ye Zichen’s face.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The demons were actually so strong back then. No matter what, Yang Jian was at the complete stage of the Human Immortal level…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Weakest soldier!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just what was the Great War of Gods and Demons like?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe…” Yang Jian merely chuckled indifferently. He grabbed hold of his lance, which was stuck in the ground, and opened his third eye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A powerful aura begun to radiate from his body…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fight me if you don’t submit it! Don’t argue if you can fight!”</span></p>
