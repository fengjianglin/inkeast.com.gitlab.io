 <p><span style>“Mom was just asking,” Ye Rong smiled, then shrugged. “If mom hadn’t left the Gu family, then you might have gotten stuck in this competition for the junior family head. That’s why I was a bit curious about your opinion.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled, “So it’s like that. If you are just asking, then if I could become the junior family head, I would…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What would you do?” Ye Rong smiled softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Destroy the Gu family,” Ye Zichen’s face suddenly turned cold, while his ice-cold gaze caused people to feel a chill in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why would you make that choice?” Ye Rong’s smile froze, but she continued to ask in a calm voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is no need to have this sort of sickly family exist,” Ye Zichen’s gaze was filled with disdain. “I had heard that once upon a time, the Gu family was the leading family among the hidden families, but now… it is merely a second-rated one.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Perhaps the decline of the family has an unavoidable reason, but it is also due to the uselessness of the people who manage the family. More importantly, they treated you as a sacrifice! If I became the junior family head, then my job would be to destroy the Gu family,” Ye Zichen did not hide the grudge in his eyes at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, Ye Rong sighed, then caressed his hair, “Mom said that nobody was wrong.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not saying that anyone was wrong,” Ye Zichen smiled. “Weren’t you just asking? I’m just saying. It’s impossible for me to become the junior family head of the Gu family, so naturally, I will not destroy it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re right,” Ye Rong smiled, then caressed Ye Zichen’s hair once again, and helped him pull up his blanket. “Rest well and don’t think too much. Mom is happy as long as I have you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, she left the room wearing a smile…</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Ye Rong walked out of the ward, she leaned on the door of the ward, and smiled wryly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Rong, do you blame me?” the room swirled with suffocating smoke. A white-haired man sat on the sofa with a look of worry on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s there to blame as the eldest sister? Isn’t taking care of my siblings my responsibility?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Back then, Ye Rong was still a young and beautiful girl. She dressed like a saint as she smiled brightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she looked at the man’s white hair, which had been completely black just a day before…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Originally, you were the hope for our Gu family for the next hundred or even thousand years, but… the demons… I, the father, was truly too meek,” the man put out his cigarette in the ash tray. His ancient face was covered in reluctance and helplessness, while his bloodshot eyes also glittered slightly… “Sorry!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s okay!” Ye Rong shook her head plainly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“After you get with Tuo Baye, you have to give birth to a son for our Gu family. If the child inherits your bloodline, then bring the child back. You shall inherit the position of the family head. In the future, the child will lead our Gu family back to the Three Realms after he grows up! If he inherits Tuo Baye’s demon bloodline, kill him… Then, return to the family. You will still be my daughter!” Viciousness surfaced on the man’s ancient face. He clenched his fist and teeth. “The demon race is the common enemy of the three realms. I cannot tolerate anyone in my family giving birth to a demon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I understand,” Ye Rong’s face was still filled with a kind smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the man looked at her smile, his face turned stark white, “You really are very like your mother. You’re both very kind… I know you carry too much of a burden…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need to say anymore. I understand,” Ye Rong smiled, then took off her saintess clothings, and revealed the black clothes she wore underneath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“From this moment onwards, my surname is no longer Gu, it is Ye… I’m called Ye Rong, and am no longer Saintess Gu Rong.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She elegantly turned around and pushed open the door without any hesitation. What met her outside was Tuo Baye’s androgynous smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He lifted Ye Rong’s chin with his hand, then smiled towards the man in the room, “A hundred years. Remember that Geezer Gu, it is merely a hundred years!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huuuuu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In that instant, Ye Rong’s eyes turned wet. She let out a long sigh and rubbed her nose, then glanced at Ye Zichen, who laid on the bed with a frown, through the glass of the door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn’t actually break my promise. This child… is not a demon! But… he isn’t a saint either. Since I didn’t return, you have been very troubled, right!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Three days passed by in an instant. During so, Ye Zichen’s condition gradually improved. At the very least, he was able to walk on the ground, but he was still unable to gather any celestial spiritual energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as if something was cutting off the connection between him and the celestial spiritual energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During those three days, Gu Tian and co. also visited Ye Zichen, and this group of people who visited him included Qi Cheng, who truly annoyed him. That being said, that woman was definitely adept at kissing ass, since she managed to make Mother Ye very happy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Ye Zichen didn’t find it right to expose the woman’s true face in front of Mother Ye, he was only able to warn her not to be too outrageous in secret.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the woman merely smiled, and continued what she was doing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Auntie, my dad really wants to see you…” as a conversation could be heard outside the ward, Ye Zichen, who was watching a video on his phone, chucked his phone to the side and looked up…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, saw Gu Tian and Mother Ye walk over side by side, the latter who seemed to be pleading with Mother Ye for something.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Say no more. I will naturally see him when I want to. Didn’t you have business with Zichen, go on and chat!” Mother Ye directly turned around and left after sending Gu Tian to the ward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows with a smile, “You failed again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, I failed!” Gu Tian shrugged helplessly. “Say, it really is my fault. I shouldn’t have mentioned this to my dad. Everything’s great now, the moment I return home, he would mention it to me. Not only that, he even decreed that I have to make eldest aunt agree…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You really call her “Auntie” rather passionately!” Ye Zichen smiled playfully. “C’mon, let’s hear you call cousin.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It naturally is fine for me to call you cousin, but do you dare to answer? I, your younger cousin brother is in a shit load of trouble, if you really dare to answer, just wait for your suffering!” Gu Tian also smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows, “Then try it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cousin!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Gu Tian finished, Ye Zichen smacked him on the head, “You really called when I told you so. Kid, why don’t you have any opinions for yourself? You want to be the junior family head of the Gu family just like this? How many times did I tell you? You’ve got to have a temper. Just now… you would have passed if you just slapped me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You really are unreasonable. Can I actually to beat you?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s not like I didn’t try, but I would get beaten up every single time. That’s why I got smart, and just did whatever I’m told. If I don’t do it, then it is just one hit at most, but if I resist, then it is a good beating.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Zeze… Look at your idiotic look,” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes. “Come on, tell me, what did you come to report to me for!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This time… I’m here to take you to the Gu family!”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Original Chapter Teaser:</b>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p><strong>Ye Rong:&nbsp;</strong>There isn't any special reason, mom's just asking for curiosity. If mom didn't leave the Gu family, then you would be involved in this junior family head election anyways, but as a candidate instead.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Ooh, in that case... If I become the junior family head, I will destroy the entire Gu family.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Rong:&nbsp;</strong>Zichen... Why?</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>For a family to have fallen so low as to give up their daughter to a demon, there is definitely something wrong with the family. The fault wouldn't lie with only the family head, but with all the people of power within the family. After all, it is definitely due to their continuous decisions that cause a once glorious family to fall so low.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Rong:&nbsp;</strong>Mom already told you that no-one was wrong.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>I'm not stating that anyone was wrong, I'm merely stating the truth.</p>
