 <p><span style>Chapter 727 – Reports Shall be Rewarded</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since most of the Immortal Region’s civilians were evacuated to the subdimension the white-robed man had created, most of them survived.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, the various cities suffered different levels of damage as the battlegrounds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In particular, Pool City had been reduced to complete rubble-.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the demons retreated, the civilians began to repair the cities. In two weeks worth of time, apart from Pool City, all of the other cities were more or less completely repaired and seemed even grander compared to before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zeze, wow, you guys are amazing at building cities!” Ye Zichen exclaimed as he stood outside Maple City.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Such efficiency…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>They would definitely be the best construction team amongst the best in the Modern Realm.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“People have infinite potential,” Flame Emperor smiled. He had already gotten used to all this throughout his long life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I definitely agree.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Shi Huang had ordered the construction of the Great Wall in the Modern Realm, which was then built up from scratch by civilians moving a stone at a time. What’s more, this was the Three Realms where even normal commoners were at the False Spiritual Body level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Repairing the cities was not too difficult.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is this the place where the ley line suddenly rampaged?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen glanced back at where the ley line was hidden previously`.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Flame Emperor also stopped smiling. “To be more precise, it should be around a hundred meters in front of us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let us take a look.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen walked over and closed his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was very familiar with this place after gaining the memories of his past life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Flame Emperor kept silent when he saw how serious Ye Zichen looked. He then gave orders to everyone else not to walk over here to prevent Ye Zichen from getting disturbed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An hour later…</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the past hour, Ye Zichen entered a trance, causing even his breathing to become nearly undetectable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Flame Emperor could sense that Ye Zichen’s spiritual consciousness now wrapped around the vast area.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A wave of spiritual energy spread forth from Ye Zichen as he opened his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His dark orbs glistened with confidence as he smirked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That old guy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You found a clue?” Flame Emperor hurried over. The ley line was of utmost importance to the Three Realms. He had been in near complete panic when he saw the ley line disappear from his sights.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Ye Zichen comforted him the past few days by telling him that the ley line could not be lost, he found himself unable to eat or sleep without seeing the ley line again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm, I told you the ley line wouldn’t randomly go on a rampage. Someone did something to try and capture the ley line and he managed to succeed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Captured?” Flame Emperor gasped. “Isn’t the ley line a manifestation of all spirits in the world? How could it get captured?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since I managed to hide it back then, why can’t someone else capture it?” Ye Zichen wasn’t panicked at all. “He really didn’t change after all these years. He’s still so… Mmm, sleazy? He didn’t cultivate to try and break through, but instead spent his days researching the ley line. That is some dedication right there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you talking about?” Flame Emperor was rather confused. He barely understood anything of what Ye Zichen was saying. The only thing that he caught from it was that the thief was an old person in the Three Realms.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>But why did he steal the Three Realms’ ley line if that person is also from the Three Realms?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen explained when he saw Flame Emperor’s confusion, “The old guy has been holding it back for tens of thousands of years, he naturally couldn’t resist when he saw the ley line. What’s more, you should know as well as I do that the closer a person I to the ley line the stronger its effects. He is urging to break through, so he was definitely going to steal the ley line. But his skills are definitely lacking, so he left a bit of clues. However, it was all thanks to that that I managed to find out who it was.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Flame Emperor didn’t quite understand, but he could tell that Ye Zichen already understood what was going on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then we…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’re not in a hurry. Let’s find a restaurant in town first. I need to make some arrangements before going over.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the Red Packet Server…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The group was beyond lively after the two weeks of hurrah. Most of the Underworld staff were in the group now, but a few new people would enter now and then, sending out waves of red packets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ones from the Heavenly Court were truly overjoyed. </span><i><span style>We didn’t join the group for nothing!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>They had almost all gotten filthy rich over the past two weeks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy (Admin): @King Qinguang, please send some red packets as a new person. If you do not, then you will be kicked out from the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had been forced to set a few admins due to the massive increase in group members.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy was his little sister in name, so Ye Zichen naturally promoted her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: Old Qin, you’re finally here. Hurry up, send red packets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Qinguang: Huh?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Someone had to stay behind when the two groups merged and King Qinguang took the role as the eldest of the Ten Yama Kings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His departure from the group also represented the true disbandment of the Underworld’s Staff Chat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was completely confused upon his entrance into the Red Packet Server. </span><i><span style>What’s going on? Why am I being asked to send red packets immediately after entering the group.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Stop messing around. I have always been on the receiving end!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Dude, didn’t you see Immortality Peach Fairy telling you to send red packets? If you don’t , she really will kick you out without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy (Admin): @King Qinguang, you have one minute remaining.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang: Big Brother, hurry up. They really will kick you out if you don’t! &lt;insert a row of sobbing emojis&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was very clear that he had once been kicked out of the group before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The one who kicked him out was naturally Ye Zichen and he had paid a huge price to return.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Qinguang: …</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy (Admin): @King Qinguang, you have thirty seconds remaining.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Man, it’s sure lively here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but comment when he saw just how active the chat group was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang: Greetings to the master &lt;insert a row of cute emojis&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Sky Sovereign, please accept our warmest welcomes for invigilation and guidance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy (Admin): Big Brother, why are you here? King Qinguang didn’t send any red packets when he entered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Qinguang: …</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: He didn’t send any red packets? Just kick him then.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clicked on King Qinguang’s profile pic and kicked him out of the group without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: …</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: …</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: …</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang: …</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Fine, I guess kicking without much prior notice is just like Sky Sovereign.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen ignored the ellipses and just mentioned all the high ranking people of the Heavenly Court and Underworld.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What have your bosses been up to recently? Tell me now. You will be rewarded for your reports!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon, another round of ellipses appeared in the chat.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Report?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Does he really think of us as spies?</span></i></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Original Chapter Teaser:</strong>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>While the demons retreated from the Three Realms, the people of the Immortal Region cheered and celebrated. Nothing was better than kicking out the invaders and getting their homes back. Although the cities were in ruins, they could still rebuild them.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Ye Zichen did not sit idly by. Ever since awakening the memories of his past life, he finally felt a hint of&nbsp;being like the main character of a novel.&nbsp;He was&nbsp;strong, he cultivated fast and he actually began to understand what he was doing.</p>
 <p>At the same time, he also needed to investigate the disappearance of the ley line. Although he did have some ideas,&nbsp;he could only confirm them after he checks out the area. So...&nbsp;What would he find there?</p>

 <p></p>
 <p>I'm so terribly sorry. I feel asleep after work on Friday night, then had to go back to Guangzhou on Saturday. Sunday was rather hectic as well and I didn't have much access to internet. &gt;.&lt;</p>
 <p>I'm back now though and fingers-crossed that things will get better from here. For now, please just enjoy the 2 chapters of SMTM and 1 chapter of RPS from me.</p>
