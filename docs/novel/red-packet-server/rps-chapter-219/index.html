 <p><span style>Chapter 219 – Chang’e’s Affability Level</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen kicked Lil’ White to the side. </span><i><span style>Why did this little guy have to say such unlucky things to him as well?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, you hit me again,” Lil’ White looked at Ye Zichen with pitiful puppy eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t you know why I hit you?” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes. “I’m standing here alive and well, and you told me that I died! Then are you talking to a ghost?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn’t lie to you!” Lil’ White wagged its tail in front of Ye Zichen. “The aura of death is very dense around you. That’s a situation that would only happen if you died before. I also used my scanning eyes, and saw that you did die several hours earlier.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You still dare to continue…” Ye Zichen acted like he was going to hit Lil’ White again, causing the latter to immediately run away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Late at night.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the bell for midnight sounded out, Ye Zichen laid on the bed, while gazing at the ceiling, without any reaction.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Did I really die before?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Lil’ White had said it in such confidence, and that crazy fan of Jing Wan also said that he saw me die.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s more, what I thought were just a delusion…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I died in it too.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his hand in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>My hand is still warm, and I still cast a shadow when the sunlight shines on me. How did I die before?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you doing? You seem to be in a weird mood,” Liu Qing floated out of the Dragon Eye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen turned his head with a smile and looked at her in the eyes, “Some strange things happened today…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, Ye Zichen told Liu Qing all about what Lil’ White and the glasses-wearing young man as well as his daydream.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing blinked after hearing that, then after thinking about it for a moment, she replied, “Then you’re alive right now, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course…” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes in annoyance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Liu Qing shrugged, “Then that’s good, since you’re alive, why think about it so much? If you can’t think it through, then don’t think about it at all, it’s just adding to your frustration.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They say that no one is wise in their own affairs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing’s words immediately cleared Ye Zichen’s mind.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That’s true, why think about so much? No matter what, I’m alive right now.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems like this lady was very successful in enlightening you. Then let me borrow your phone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…” Ye Zichen’s face darkened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, Liu Qing pouted, “Hurry up, I have to read the latest chapter.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are truly traversing far on the path of a fujoshi.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m fine with it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi, you’ve come regularly to school, it isn’t like you!” Zhang Rui hook his arm around Ye Zichen’s shoulder as they walked towards their dormitory.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How could I not? The Kind Killer gave me the ultimatum, you should know the results awaiting me if I don’t go to class…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhang Rui couldn’t help but shrink his neck when the Kind Killer was mentioned, “RIP!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhang Rui didn’t have anything much to say about it. The Kind Killer’s prowess was something that the entire faculty and even the entirety of Polytechnic University had witnessed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Back at the dorm, their three other roommates were already ready.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi, Lil’ Rui, hurry up and login. The experienced guy is about to start.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kang Peng waved towards the two who had just walked in. Ye Zichen nodded, then turned on his computer. At that moment, the phone on the computer table rang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen picked up the phone, then saw that Chang’e had sent a message to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Start first, I’ll come later!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen ran over to his bed while his roommates complained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chang’e’s pink chat seemed clearly different to everyone else’s. Ye Zichen took a look at the message…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chang’e: Sky Sovereign, are you here?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chang’e: We finished all the spicy gluten that you sent last time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was shocked.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That was several hundred yuan worth of spicy gluten! Just how long has it been? She finished it all already?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Fairy, you ate the spicy glutens a tad bit too quickly, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though the other person was Chang’e, Ye Zichen truly couldn’t help but retort.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within the Moon Palace, Chang’e, who was holding the phone, blushed when she saw the message Ye Zichen sent her.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What can I do? I just like to eat it!.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Actually, there’s still a bit more, I…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chang’e replied hesitantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sighed helplessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, this sovereign will send some to you later.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you, Sky Sovereign.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your intimacy level with Chang’e increased by 100. Current intimacy level: 300.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your affability level with Chang’e increased by 15. Current affability level: 15.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Affability level appeared!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Logically speaking, affability level…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>This Chang’e can’t have gotten a crush on me, right?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen opened his eyes wide, while his heart beat loudly. He thought about it, then quickly sought Yue Lao out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yue Lao!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao, who was in the midst of playing Landlord in the Heavenly Court, picked up his phone, then replied after seeing the message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you have time? I want to ask you something.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Erm…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao glanced at Old Lord Taishang and Erlang Shen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yue Lao, it’s your turn. Hurry up, do you want to run now that you won?” Old Lord Taishang glared at him in anger. This Old Lord really didn’t get it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had played Landlord so many times, but he has barely won any of the rounds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, it’s inconvenient for me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Yue Lao patted the cards on his table…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see, you don’t want to stock up anymore, right!?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Did he really think that I was asking him just now?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The moment the products were mentioned, Yue Lao instantly gave up. He slightly comforted Old Lord Taishang, then replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, please ask.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to know how a False Marriage String appears, I’ve recently been connected to one.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“False Marriage String,” Yue Lao touched his beard. “This False Marriage String is actually similar to the Marriage String, both of them are links of a couple in love. However, a False Marriage String is different from a Marriage String in that the relationship is not firm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Normally speaking, a False Marriage String appears when one side has something that the other side likes, causing the other side to be moved. However, since there is no actual love, a False Marriage String would be produced.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded after seeing Yue Lao’s explanation, then asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what’s with the affability level on a False Marriage String!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When the affability level on a False Marriage String rises to a certain level, it will turn into a real Marriage String.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This is serious.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at the news blankly.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It will turn into a real Marriage String once it reaches a certain level.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Doesn’t that mean that Chang’e will truly fall in love with me in the future? Then wouldn’t that cause me to be screwed by the deities that have a hidden crush on Chang’e?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I’m just a mere mortal, I can’t beat deities.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen asked once more for his own safety.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then can you make the False Marriage String’s affability level to not be able increase anymore…?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t think so. Affability level is very mystical, it can’t be controlled.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao raised his eyebrows, after connecting red strings of fate for so many years, this was the first time he met someone that wanted to decrease affability level, and it was a man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, when Yue Lao thought about the importance of this Sky Sovereign for him, he couldn’t help but ask.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, how about you tell me the name of the person with the False Marriage String? Perhaps I can help you try to decrease the affability level or directly cut the string for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you for real?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can try!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then…” Ye Zichen licked his lips. “She is Chang’e!”</span></p>
