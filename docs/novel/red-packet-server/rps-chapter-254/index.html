 <p><span style>Chapter 254 – A Lesson</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen and Mu Chuang got in the car, Mu Jinglei noticed the bruises on Mu Chuang’s face and the blood at the corner of his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although she didn’t ask, Ye Zichen could tell from her gaze that she still cared about it a lot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This brat didn’t do anything proper, so I taught him a lesson,” Ye Zichen hook Mu Chuang’s shoulder and chuckled. “He promised me that he won’t ever gamble again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is good,” Mu Jinglei smiled faintly, while her depressed mood started to turn for the better.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she was still overwhelmed with self-mockery that she could not hide.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>My boyfriend for a year was actually someone like that. It truly is ridiculous when I think about how I was on the verge to getting married to him.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Later that night.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Mu siblings stayed in Ye Zichen’s home to rest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The three of them came to a tacit understanding to not mention about the troubles at the casino to Mother Ye. They merely told her that they got Mu Chuang back with money.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chuang naturally got scolded. Meanwhile, Ye Zichen, who had already tired himself out for the day went back to his room to rest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the next day, Mu Jinglei decided to take her annual leave from the school to nobody’s surprise. After all, she should get a good rest after so much had happened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen returned home, the moment his veterinary lessons were over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chuang had gotten ready very early, because Ye Zichen had said in the morning that he would bring him to the clubhouse today.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jinglei-jie, I’m going to take Mu Chuang out for a bit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm,” Mu Jinglei nodded slightly. It was apparent that she had not yet come out of her depression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen signaled Lil’ White, who was wandering around the room. Lil’ White immediately wagged his tail to show that he understood, and jumped beside Mu Jinglei and wiggled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled. </span><i><span style>With someone that knew how to make her laugh here, Jinglei-jie’s mood should improve.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Then, he left the mansion with Mu Chuang and took Mu Jinglei’s car to get to the clubhouse.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Today, I must teach Mu Chuang a lesson.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“This is the clubhouse you were talking about?” </span><i><span style>To be honest, this clubhouse isn’t all that big, and compared to Xiao Hai’s commercial clubhouse, this seemed rather tiny.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Chuang nodded, then revealed a worried expression, “Zichen-ge, the stuff in the clubhouse isn’t just a little high… We…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come with your Zichen-ge. Today, I’ll teach you a good lesson,” With that, Ye Zichen hooked his arm around Mu Chuang’s shoulder and walked in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir, please show your membership card!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment they entered, a tall girl wearing a qipao came up to them. </span><i><span style>Hmm, although this clubhouse didn’t seem as grand as Xiao Hai’s from the outside, the interior was rather well decorated.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>The tall beauties wearing qipaos were also extremely pleasant to look at.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s my first time here, help me register for a membership card.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then please sir, this way,” The girl’s face lit up more since they did get a commission if guests wanted to apply for a membership card.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Membership cards are separated into silver cards, gold cards, platinum cards and diamond cards. Each card corresponds to different treatments…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Diamond card!” Ye Zichen casually took out his card and slapped it on the table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The girl was momentarily stunned before she explained kindly, “Diamond cards require ten million…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s fine!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, the girl was stunned. Then, a huge smile blossomed on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chuang couldn’t help but feel a hint of jealousy when he saw the smiling girl and Ye Zichen’s calmness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had come to the clubhouse with Li En several times before, but never once had he seen the greeter smile so brightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Approximately three minutes later, the girl handed Ye Zichen’s card and a diamond card over respectfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir, please enjoy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>­Scribble.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen took out his chequebook, wrote a string of numbers on a cheque and stuffed it in the girl’s cleavage. From what Mu Chuang remembered, this sort of action as not allowed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This… is your reward.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chuang had seen a boss stuff tips in a girl’s cleavage, but what he got in return was a slap in the face. Then, he even got kicked out of the clubhouse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chuang never could have expected that the greeter smiled even more brightly after taking out the cheque.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She bit her lips, then took a pen and a slip of paper from the reception to write down a string of numbers, which she handed to Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s have a meal together when you have time!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure!” Ye Zichen placed the slip of paper in his pocket, then patted Mu Chuang’s head with a smile. “I’m here to accompany my little brother. He’s rather interested in a girl here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So it’s like that. Then please have fun with your little brother. I won’t delay you any longer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded towards the girl slightly, then patted Mu Chuang’s head, before walking away, leaving the girl standing still with stars in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s so cool.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen-ge, you’re so amazing,” Mu Chuang said shortly after they walked away from the reception. “I came here with Li En before, but never once was it like this… Every single one of those greeters are extremely proud, so getting a phone number from them was impossible. Li En told me that there were rules here, we can’t…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The fact that he can’t just means that he’s not qualified,” Ye Zichen smiled faintly. “This is big brother’s first lesson to you. In this society, your status corresponds to the treatment you receive. There is no can’t, there is only not enough…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mr. Ye!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The clubhouse’s supervisor immediately walked over with a huge smile when Ye Zichen and Mu Chuang got to a room on the second floor. People rarely applied for a diamond card, so he definitely had to take good care of this source of income.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I heard that this is your first time coming do our clubhouse. Do you need me to help you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shook his finger at the supervisor, then patted Mu Chuang, who stood beside him, “Say it, who is it! As the older brother, I also want to know which girl my little brother was mesmerized by!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s that girl in purple!” Mu Chuang scratched his head slightly embarrassedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye ZIchen took a look at the purple-shirted girl in the roster book and nodded, “Her… and the girl in blue next to her. I’ll choose these two!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, please wait a moment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The supervisor left the room. Not long later, someone knocked on the door, and two pretty girls walked in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gulp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chuang blushed. It was clear that he liked the girl a lot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mr. Ye!” The two girls greeted Ye Zichen at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded towards them with a smile and called the girls over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He told the girl, who Mu Chuang liked, to stay by Mu Chuang’s side, and walked to the other side of the room with the girl in blue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mr. Ye, is this your first time coming here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The girl’s appropriate smile easily gained the affection of others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows slightly, finished the wine in his glass and smiled, “Shouldn’t you do a self-introduction before that?”</span></p>
