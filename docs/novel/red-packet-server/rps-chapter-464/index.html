<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p><span style>Chapter 464 – Who is the master?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Divine artifact! You’re the artifact spirit of a sword-type divine artifact!” Meng Da’s eyes were filled with shock. He never expected to meet a divine-artifact wielding master in a place like this puny village.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Judging from the artifact spirit’s attack, she is at the late-stage Human Immortal level.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t even dare to imagine how strong the master of the divine artifact would be.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was merely a False Earth Immortal. If he was to use his esteemed master’s words, then his strength was merely that of a beginner’s in the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His esteemed master was a Human Immortal, and that was a height that he couldn’t even begin to look up to.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry, I’ve disturbed my lord. I’ll leave immediately.” Meng Da immediately turned around and left without any sign of hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Zhou family wanted to speak, but were stopped by his fierce gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, Zhou Zhenhe felt chilled to the core.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>We, the Zhou family, rely completely on Meng Da. Why does Spiritual Breeze Village have such a powerful person protecting them?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go!” Zhou Zhenhe sullenly led the Zhou family members away. However, at that very moment, Xuan-Yuan Xiang leaped over and blocked his path…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry, my master gave his orders. Since you hit a Spiritual Breeze Villager, you must accept payback.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xuan-Yuan Xiang punched Zhou Zhenhe, causing him to spit out a large amount of blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xuan-Yuan Xiang’s punch directly broke his meridian, if he was unable to find some sort miraculous pill…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he could only be a normal person for the rest of his life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Scram!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Leave, leave, leave!” Zhou Zhenhe’s father quickly told other people to carry his son as they frantically left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Spiritual Breeze Villagers all watched on with shock, but they soon began to cheer joyously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you for your aid,” Spiritual Breeze Village’s leading figures all walked over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xuan-Yuan Xiang shrugged with a smile, “Don’t thank me, these were things that my master told me to do.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I wonder if that master could come out? We are willing to present all of our black crystals as thanks,” Xue Qi raised his eyebrows. Spiritual Breeze Village was still too weak, and they needed someone who can protect their village.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Since this master clearly has good feeling towards our village, then maybe…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Never mind that. My master already has me, so do you think he would need those black crystals?” Xuan-Yuan Xiang smiled. “Oh yeah, my master told me to pass along a message to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please say it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Try to leave this place as soon as possible if you can. Trees can’t survive frequent migration, but people can. The Zhou family and that Meng kiddie definitely will not give up so easily… Since your village has black crystals, then you will only develop better inside cities. That’s it. Take care!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoosh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Xuan-Yuan Xiang disappeared from their sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xue Qi looked dejectedly at the village once again. The village was a piece of land that their entire village has lived on for over a thousand years. </span><i><span style>Do we have to just leave like this?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Xue, is that person our village’s ascender? She’s so damn strong! But why does she have a master… Didn’t she just get ascended? But that ascender is so beautiful!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Stone walked over with open eyes. Even then, he still did not realize that Xuan-Yuan Xiang was actually an artifact spirit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was just simple-minded, and if others do not spend a lot of effort into explaining a mistaken view he has, then he would never understand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xue Qi, who had lived with him since they were young, understood him to always be like that, so he merely rolled his eyes in response, then glanced towards Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So amazing, how can that woman be so beautiful and so amazing? Doesn’t that mean her master is even more amazing?” Ye Zichen repeatedly muttered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Stone chuckled, then wrapped his arm around Ye Zichen’s shoulder. “Kid, don’t be down. If you work hard, then you might not find someone stronger than that woman, but you can find a girl prettier than her.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Seriously… Why did I suspect him of being the master?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Xue Qi shook his head with a sigh. He had already checked Ye Zichen out when the latter arrived, Ye Zichen didn’t even reach the False Spiritual Body level. Meanwhile, that master is definitely terrifyingly strong, so he definitely couldn’t be Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Seriously, too many things happened recently, so I can’t even think clearly.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Stone, Lil’ Yu, come with me to the ancestral hall… Everyone else, just go on back!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>At Spiritual Breeze Village’s ancestral hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Xue Qi and the others respectfully lit a few incense sticks for Yang Jian, they sat down on the straw cushions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ Yu bit her lips and looked towards Xue Qi, “That master told us to leave as well. What do you think?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not certain,” Xue Qi sighed. “The villagers have lived here for so long, if we tell them to leave…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is all for a brighter future,” Lil’ Yu advised. She definitely agreed with the village moving. </span><i><span style>Since the news had already been leaked, then only more and more people would come to cause trouble for their village!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Although they had a master protecting them this time, they couldn’t count on the master every single time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If they don’t want to get bullied, then the best way was to strengthen themselves. If a few Earth Immortals could arise from Spiritual Breeze Village, then nobody would dare to bully them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Never mind, let’s get Ye Zichen tomorrow and sell all the black crystals in a nearby city, then buy a our village a manor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm, but do be careful then. The city is even more chaotic.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know,” Xue Qi replied plainly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ Yu instantly rolled her eyes. “I was talking to Stone, he’s too simple minded, I’m worried that he would cause trouble.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, girlie! How’s laozi simple minded!?” Stone knitted his eyebrows in annoyance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ Yu merely shrugged in response. At the same time, Xue Qi also raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, calm down,” after Xue Qi calmed Stone down, he turned back towards Lil’ Yu. “Do you think it’s possible that the master is…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you talking about him?” Lil’ Yu shook his head. “I feel like that’s impossible. Yes, he is very mysterious, but someone with a divine artifact that has an artifact spirit has to be an expert of at least the Sky Immortal level! Do you think that’s him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As expected, I thought about it too much,” Xue Qi shook his head with a wry smile, then stood up from the straw cushion. “Let’s end it at this. Let’s go to the city tomorrow!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, what are you guys talking about? Why didn’t laozi get anything!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t need to understand, hurry up and go back home and sleep with your wife!” Lil’ Yu rolled her eyes speechlessly, then left the ancestral hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that girl bleeding? Why is she acting as if she has something against laozi?” Stone raised his eyebrows in annoyance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You idiot,” with that, Xue Qi rolled his eyes and left as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, only Stone was left behind as he scratched his head, “Old Xue is bleeding as well? Why hasn’t laozi bled before!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did you make me do it just now? Wouldn’t it have been better if you came out yourself?” Xuan-Yuan Xiang dangled her legs and asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled after doing two sets of sit-ups, “I feel like it’s pretty good like this. If I tell them my identity, then do you think they would still treat me like this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Definitely not,” Xuan-Yuan Xiang answered without thinking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was not surprised by her answer at all, “Exactly. I don’t want to catch people’s attention. Being a little miner in the village is pretty nice.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Creak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the door to his room was pushed open. Xue Lan stuck her head through the gap and walked in, then began smelling around the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, she walked in front of Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Zichen, the really amazing person is actually you, right?”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Original Chapter Teaser:</strong>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Xuan-Yuan Xiang's sudden and dominating appearance shocked everyone. Not only did she appear out of nowhere, she was also able to dominate Zhou Zhenhe's brother in law in a fight.</p>
 <p>Yet, her appearance only raised more questions for the other people. Just who is she? Who is the master she is talking about? Just how strong is he? And more importantly, who exactly is he? Would he be able to protect Spiritual Breeze Village permanently?</p>
 <p>Why did Ye Zichen actually tell her to do that instead of revealing his own identity and strength himself?</p>
