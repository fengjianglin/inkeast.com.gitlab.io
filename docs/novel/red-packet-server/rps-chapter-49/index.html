 <p><span style>Liu Qing’s expression turned more and more unnatural. She stared closely at Ye Zichen for a few moments.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, she reminded him of treating the issue properly before returning into the Dragon Eye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen only felt that Liu Qing was a bit weird, but he didn’t think too much into it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, with in Bingcheng’s Xiao family home.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dad, your body condition does not allow you to mess around like this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Qihu frowned as he sat on the sofa, while looking at Elder Su, who was grabbing the gourd tightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know my body the best. There is only benefits and no drawbacks for me to drink this wine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can’t be like this…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop bullshitting, just who’s the father here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Man Su straightened his back, causing Su Qihu to instantly give up and shrug.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dad, I’m doing this for your own good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, stop saying useless stuff with this old man. I must keep the monkey wine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Qihu could only show a helpless expression as he looked at Elder Su, who was not backing down. After a long while he finally let out a long sigh and said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, I’ll listen to you. But you definitely cannot be greedy. You truly can’t drink too much wine with your body.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that Su Qihu gave in, Elder Su showed a satisfied smile and nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This old man knows this. I still want to live to the day that my darling granddaughter gets married!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Qihu also nodded slightly. At this moment, Old Man Su put the gourd to the side, then leaned forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you think about that lad?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Which one?” Su Qihu asked in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The one that saved Lil’ Yan and I today,” Old Man Su reminded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothing special,” Su Qihu shook his head. When he saw Old Man Su’s dark expression, he momentarily blanked and said, “Dad, you can’t be wanting Su Yan to go out with that sort of person, right? I’m telling you. I definitely will not agree!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you not agreeing, Lil’ Ye is a great kid. What? Do you want to use Lil’ Yan in a political marriage?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Man Su glared, Su Qihu did not intend to give in at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dad, this is definitely impossible. Even if I don’t use Lil’ Yan in a political marriage, I won’t put her in the hands of those sort of people.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That means you want to?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t care about whether I want to or not. I said no, so it’s no!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Su Qihu turned around and walked outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan walked down from the second floor, she had heard Elder Su and Su Qihu’s entire conversation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandpa, will my dad truly use me for a political marriage? I don’t want to. I don’t want to live the kind of life where a single word makes me spend the rest of my life with someone I’ve never even met.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Su patted her head when he saw his darling granddaughter’s sad eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandpa will not let you become a sacrifice. What’s more, your dad won’t do that sort of thing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But what he said just now…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He was just mad at me,” Old Man Su smiled. Then he looked at the green gourd on the side, “Since you don’t want a political marriage, what do you think about being with Lil’ Ye?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I…” Su Yan hesitated for a long time, then murmured. “I don’t dislike him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not disliking is liking,” Old Man Su chuckled and picked up the green gourd. “Alright, go back and rest. Just leave the rest of the stuff for grandpa to handle.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was woken up from his sweet dream by the sound of WeChat. He blurrily found his phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ever since he had brought Liu Qing, this little ghost girl back, she would wake him up at seven o’clock sharp every day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was even more accurate than an alarm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For once Liu Qing didn’t wake him, his phone, his phone just had to ring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He picked up his phone and unlocked the screen.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck, no wonder Liu Qing didn’t call him yet, it’s only f*cking six thirty.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Who the hell sends him a message so early in the morning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who was still sleepy, looked at his phone…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You finally live, my great sage.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, he was completely devoid of sleepiness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen gulped and sat up from the bed and opened the chat with the Great Sage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: Haha, I’ve returned!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: This trip truly tired I, Old Sun, out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tired out?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He went to work?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen thought about it a while, then sent a message in a testing manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great Sage, where did you go to work?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Instant reply!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: You should also know that us deities are not like mortals. Our lives are extremely long. Recently, the Heavenly Court has been a bit crowded, that old brat, the Jade Emperor, told I, Old Sun, to clean up the barbaric places and expand our land.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So he went to take over territories.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled understandingly, then started chatting with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Who went to expand the land? I saw that none of the celestial friends seemed to have gone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: He, there’s no need for that many people to clean up the barbaric lands. I, Old Sun, with a Jingu Bang is enough. Oh yeah, Erlang Shen wanted to steal Old Sun’s job, and so I beat him up.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ugh</span></i><span style>.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No wonder Erlang Shen didn’t take the initiative to find him recently, it seems like he got beaten by the monkey king, so he had to tend to his wounds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, that Erlang Shen was his sworn brother, so he did feel a bit bad.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, in Ye Zichen’s heart, he still wanted to become sworn brothers with the Great Sage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was definitely the number one existence in the Heavenly Court since he could beat up Erlang Shen!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He definitely had to get on good terms with that person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rubbed his hands and looked around the room. He noticed that there was a cup noodle that Zhu Yubai had left from when he was playing games the previosu day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Scan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Send.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King received your red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: Hehe, what treasure is this now?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: This is something that this little deity received in a secret location. Since the Great Sage has been troubled having to fight in the barbaric lands, this little deity does’t have much to give to Great Sage. Thus, I can only use a cup noodle to express my thoughts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: Cup noodles?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s heart leaped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He actually accidentally said the name out. But no worries, he could save it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: This is the name this little deity had given it. It is called cup noodle…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen blabbered a bunch of stuff to the Monkey King. He was clear about the monkey’s personality, this sort of knowledge was like Xuanzang reading scriptures.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: Alright, just tell Old Sun how to eat it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Soak it in water.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: Alright, Old Sun understands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your intimacy level with Monkey King increased by 5. Current intimacy level: 175. It is 25 away from Trusted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Intimacy Level increased again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the increase was a bit little this time, it was still better than nothing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, the Monkey King replied with an awkward emoji.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: I, Old Sun, doesn’t have anything nice on hand to give you.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: No worries, it’s fine with the Great Sage’s intention.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: That’s no good. I, Old Sun, is not that kind of person that likes to take advantage of people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, Ye Zichen couldn’t help but twitch his mouth. Did the Great Sage not take much advantage of people in Journey to the West?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He would just pocket whatever nice stuff he saw. The people at the Heavenly Court were unable to do anything about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen momentarily blanked, he didn’t think that the Great Sage really would send something.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He clicked open the red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received Monkey King’s red packet.</span></p>
