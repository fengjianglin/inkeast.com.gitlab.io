 <p><span style>Chapter 614 – Battling a Sky Immortal</span></p>
 <p><span style>The scythe Ye Zichen carried on his shoulders was as tall as a person, he surveyed the old man, whose eyes had turned crimson. It was clear that he already lost his sanity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The bloodthirsty old man looked up, staring at Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, he suddenly stomped on the ground, and formed claws with his hands, before dashing towards Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Be careful, his speed isn’t that of a normal person’s…” Luo Yang reminded Ye Zichen as he covered his wound.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded and gripped the blood-red scythe tightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ding. Ding. Ding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen waved the scythe casually and blocked off all the attacks, causing sounds to ring out when the old man’s claws collided against the scythe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re still trying to act fierce?” Ye Zichen hacked down with his scythe, dropping the old man’s right arm down to the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The old man wailed in pain, then grabbed the arm off the ground and began to tear at it with his teeth…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Stone and co., who stood in front of the courtyard, couldn’t help but wish to vomit. Eating other people’s flesh was one thing, but this guy was actually eating his own as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, the moment the old man finished swallowing his own arm…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The elder’s former mid-stage Sky Immortal spiritual pressure actually increased greatly and became that of a late stage Sky Immortal’s in&nbsp;mere moments.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, the arm that Ye Zichen chopped off grew out once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Recovery and strengthening through devouring flesh and blood? No wonder his level seems too unstable. But then again, the self-recovery is a bit troublesome,” Ye Zichen nodded as he watched.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the old man also smiled menacingly, and charged over once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was extremely fast. In fact, he was so fast that Ye Zichen could not determine his position using the naked eye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi, behind you!” Xue Qi suddenly shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen felt a chill down his spine and roared out in his mind…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Swirling Flash Plate!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>But he was too late.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His back was attacked mere seconds before he summoned out the armor, and a piece of flesh was ripped off by the old man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jaja….” The old man laughed strangely as if he was mocking Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen took out a recovery pill and chucked it into his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He gripped the scythe tightly with his two hands and revealed a serious expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Take this!” At that moment, Luo Yang, who had been waiting for an opportunity, thrust forward with his lance. “You actually dared to harm my citizens in front of me. Die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luo Yang’s heart was filled with rage when he saw the citizens die by the old man’s hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The corner of the old man’s mouth lifted despite having his back facing Luo Yang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, Ye Zichen felt a hint of worry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Luo Yang’s lance continued to thrust through the air without any hesitation. Yet, only when his lance pierced through the old man’s body did everyone notice that the ‘body’ was merely an afterimage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahhhh!” Luo Yang let out a terrible scream.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The old man had already appeared behind him and sank his sharp fangs into his neck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck off!” Ye Zichen kicked the old man away, then took out a pill for Luo Yang. “You alright?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luo Yang’s face was pale. It was clear that he had lost a lot of blood. </span><i><span style>Judging from the speed that the old man had consumed other people’s blood, Luo Yang probably lost at least twenty percent of the blood in his body.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahem… I’m fine! This damn animal. Ugh, why isn’t my dad here yet, even though something so major is going on?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s no need for the City Lord to come over. I’ve found his weakness already,” Ye Zichen smiled, then brought the frail Luo Yang to Stone and co., before turning around to look at the old man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The old man was no longer sane. It was exactly as Ye Zichen expected.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The more blood he consumed, the stronger he got. Yet, at the same time, his ability to reason would slowly disappear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The most terrifying thing about a human was not a person’s strong physique, but rather, it was their intelligence. A person without an ability to reason was no different from a wild beast.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter how strong a person like that was, it was useless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s eyes turned darker as he rose the scythe into the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rest in peace.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoosh…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Six figures, identical to Ye Zichen, split out from his body and surrounded the old man in an instant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, the scythes hacked down towards the old man!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The menacing old man wasn’t able to act ferociously, but very soon…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A bloody mist exploded out from his body, while he felt limply onto the floor. Light began to fade from his grey and crimson eyes, while his clawed hands returned to normal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You already lost the battle the moment you lost your ability to reason.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen turned around and put away the blood scythe indifferently. However, under that cold demeanor, Ye Zichen was beyond excited.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Damn, the spiritual technique that guy taught me is so f*cking nice. Also, this weapon is way better than Xuan-Yuan Sword, and even looks a lot cooler!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xuan-Yuan Xiang, who stayed by an altar on a faraway mountain couldn’t help but sneeze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She rubbed her nose but didn’t think too much about it. Instead, she gazed at the white-shirted man, who stood not far away from her, then back onto the blade on the altar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi,” Stone ran over quickly when he saw that the battle concluded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The old man on the ground had already stopped moving, but the innocent people who had turned into dried corpses have already moved on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many of their friends and families cried near the bodies. Ye Zichen let out a soft sigh, then kicked the old man in front of Luo Yang and raised his eyebrows, “You’re the city lord’s son. I’ll leave this guy to you. You do have to give the citizens a resolution after all this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thanks,” Luo Yang cupped his hands towards Ye Zichen with a faint look of self-mockery on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the very beginning, he was rather displeased by Ye Zichen and did not understand why Ye Zichen was able to gain the affections of Zuo Mo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, after everything that has happened, he felt like Ye Zichen was indeed worthy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked back on the old man and saw the blood on the old man’s mouth and hands which had not yet dried.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The blood…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Creak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luo Yang clenched his fist tightly. </span><i><span style>It was one thing for him to harm me, but he actually dared to kill my citizens in front of me… This is unforgivable.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Zing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He lifted his lance up high. Seeing that, Ye Zichen understood what he was about to do.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he didn’t stop Luo Yang. Since he had already handed the person over to the latter, it was up to Luo Yang to decide what he wanted to do with the old man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This animal broke our city’s rules and harmed our citizens. I have to kill him myself in order to exact vengeance for my dead people!” Luo Yang stabbed down using his lance with bloodshot eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, the moment he made his move, a middle-aged man appeared in front of them and pushed Luo Yang’s lance to the side, causing it to stab into the ground instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“An accomplice!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, Ye Zichen frowned, then hacked towards the middle-aged man with his blood scythe.</span></p>

 <p></p>
 <p>In the next chapter of Red Packet Server...</p>
 <p>Ye Zichen unleashes his wrath against this old man of an enemy. For once in his life, he seemed to be able to deal with his enemies easily by himself. Yet,&nbsp;was that really the case?</p>
 <p>Actually, why did the old man come in the first place? Perhaps it has something to do with his identity? Or he was on a mission?</p>
 <p>Bloodsucking... Flesh-eating... Those were not the characteristics of a demon, but... Are they really not involved?</p>
 <p>Also, where are the city guards? Although the junior city lord is at the scene, the actual guards of the city are nowhere to be seen. So... Was there something else going on?</p>
