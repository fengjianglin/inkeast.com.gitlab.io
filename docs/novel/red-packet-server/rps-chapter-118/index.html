 <p><span style>Chapter 118 – Low EQ Gu Tian came again</span></p>
 <p><span style>This sort of comedic ending was not one that could be predicted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Ziche looked at Su Yan, who had a complaining look on her face, and Xia Keke, whose expression was slightly dark, then pulled both of them into his arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you moved? If you are then hurry up and give us the tickets.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan and Xia Keke, who were in his arms, suddenly struggled, then reached out their hands to grab for the tickets.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This script doesn’t seem right.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Shouldn’t the three of them act spoiled with each other, then he would promise them not to get involved with so many women casually in order to make these two beauties happy!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you looking at, give us the tickets.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He really couldn’t understand women’s thoughts. Ye Zichen could only took out two concert tickets from his pocket in confusion and hand it to the two girls.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, you can leave now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was truly kicked away when they got the tickets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen walked out of the mulberry grove in confusion as he thought back to what happened earlier.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the hell.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, now you’re happy, right?” Liu Qing flew in front of Ye Zichen with a frown. “I really don’t know what Keke and that Su Yan were thinking. Why did they let a scum like you get lucky.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How am I a scum!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you not a scum when you flirt with girls outside when you got a girlfriend?” Liu Qing put her hands on her waist and said angrily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was turned completely speechless by this damn chick. She definitely disapproved any of the women around him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, this was indeed a bit unfair for them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can’t retort now, right?” Liu Qing lifted her head proudly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, a black figure suddenly appeared in front of them, “Brother Ye, little ghost girl!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gu Tian!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen haven’t met this brat for a long time. Of course, he didn’t want to meet this brat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This brat’s EQ was too low, and what he said asked for a beating too easily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you doing not watching your family’s shopping mall, and always coming over to our Polytechnic University.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“To find you,” Gu Tian smiled. “I even bumped into Sis earlier, and chatted with her for a bit.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Sis!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>This brat was definitely talking about Xia Keke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you want from me, just say it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen resisted the urge to hit him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Tian raised his eyebrows and continued, “Oh yeah, there was another beauty when I saw Sis earlier. That beauty was a bit unhappy when I said Lil Sis…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s your Sis as well. Call both of them that in the future, then she’ll be happy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, Brother Ye, you really are something,” Gu Tian walked around Ye Zichen a few times. “You have such a cute ghost girl with you and two beauties that like you. You don’t let beauties or ghost beauties go. Amazing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s face already darkened. He squinted his eyes and looked at Gu Tian with a smile, “I’ll beat you up if you bullshit one more time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you going to hit me, didn’t I speak the truth?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I… Don’t stop me, let me beat this grandson to death!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, Ye Zichen was finally stopped by Liu Qing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Gu Tian complained with an expression of not understanding, “Why are you so worked up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I…” Ye Zichen raised his hand to hit him, but Liu Qing pulled him back and frowned at Gu Tian. “Can you just speak a bit less!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, but Brother Ye really…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really your ass!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, Liu Qing did not block him either. This brat was too deserving of a beating.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Ziche kicked Gu Tian’s butt, then beat him up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Later on, the two of them squatted outside the cold drinks store within Polytechnic University.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Tian sobbed with purple eyes, and looked at Ye Zichen innocently as he held a cup of coke in his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did you hit me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why shouldn’t I hit you?” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes. To be fair, this brat could take quite a bit of a beating.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it was a normal person, they would be laying in the hospital right now, but this brat could actually sit here and drink with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen ignored Gu Tian’s gaze and lit a cigarette for himself, then looked at Gu Tian, “What exactly do you want?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Tian’s expression turned serious upon mentioning that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I saw an evil ghost that wasn’t taken away by the Underworld in a haunted house earlier. I can’t deal with it myself, so I want Brother Ye to go with me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye ZIchen knew that Gu Tian had nothing good when he sought him out, but he didn’t think that he was this sort of crappy matter.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Haunted house!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Evil ghost!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Only a crazy person would go.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is the haunted house you were talking about?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye ZIchen looked at the house in front of him with his hands on his waist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The house in front of him was quite old, it didn’t have neither windows nor doors, and a faint chill could be felt when one neared it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Compared to Ye Zichen’s casual demeanor, Gu Tian was clearly more vigilant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He came here a few times and knew how savage the fellow inside was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then let’s go in to take a look.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was rather interested in this evil ghost, he had seen the Black and White Impermanence capture ghosts several times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He never could have imagined that a ghost could escape from them. Thus, he wanted to see what this evil ghost looked like.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was fine on the outside, but once they entered the house…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Creepy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen felt the hair on his body stand up the moment he entered this abandoned manor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He subconsciously circulated his qi to protect his body and walked forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where exactly is the evil ghost you were talking about” Why haven’t we seen it yet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen walked around the house with Gu Tian for several minutes, but did not catch a glimpse of the evil ghost.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It might have gone to sleep.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen lifted his head and knocked on Gu Tian’s head, “Are you f*cking kidding me? Ghosts sleep?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who’s kidding,” Gu Tian had a troubled expression. “Does the little ghost girl near you don’t sleep?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A clear sound echo’d through the mansion, causing Ye Zichen and Gu Tian’s expressions to become tense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They looked around, then set their gazes on the door in front of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems to be from there, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Tian gulped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen directly kicked open the door without thinking and rushed in with Gu Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A sharp scream rang out from the room the moment the door was opened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen and Gu Tian looked over at the source of the sound.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t look!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A girl was squatting in the corner and peeing at the corner of the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lucy, why are you here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was confused, the sound just now should have been caused by her stepping on something in the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But why did this girl come to this sort of crappy place?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was this her home?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“None of your business. Shouldn’t you turn around?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lucy’s face was dyed red. Only then did Ye Zichen react and pulled Gu Tian to turn around as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment they turned around, Liu Qing, who was in the Dragon Eye, shouted, “It came out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen quickly turned his head…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then saw a gray figure appear behind Lucy.</span></p>
