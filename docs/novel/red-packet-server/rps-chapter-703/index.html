 <p><span style>Chapter 703 – Parallel Dimension</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Are you done being insane!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The familiar scolding and tone caused the white-robed man at the center of the formation to tremble slightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re here,” the white-robed man’s voice was a bit hoarse. The newly arrived women bit her lips, glared fiercely at him, then put her hand on his back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A gust of pure lifeforce flowed from her palm into the white-robed man’s body. The white-robed man, who nearly turned into a dried up corpse, returned to how he originally look with the lifeforce.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank god you came in time. Otherwise, it’d be very troublesome,” the white-robed man scratched his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Clear rage could be seen in the woman’s eyes, “Troublesome? If I didn’t come, then you would have still set up the Heaven-Shrouding Formation even if it cost you your life, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The white-robed man only smiled without any other response.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gu Zichen, I finally see through you now. You traversed to parallel dimensions and planned with so much effort is so that the you in one dimension can turn the tables, right? But even if he succeeds, do you think that they can return?” the woman frowned. “This is not the first dimension you have come to, you did your best to help him in the previous dimensions as well, yet what happened? The same events unfolded. I told you already, that is fate. Why must you go against it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have to try as long as there is a chance, right? If I don’t, then who knows how this future will end up? Lil’ Mo, what if I tell you that the chances to turn the tables is pretty huge in this one?” the white-robed man pursed his lips with a smile, and walked out of the formation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was already shocked as he saw what happened in front of him. The main reason was the woman beside the man.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Zuo Mo?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you looking at me for?” she glared at Ye Zichen with a snort. “What is your relationship with Zuo Mo?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’re friends,” Ye Zichen answered subconsciously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Like I thought, friends, again,” Zuo Mo snorted with a frown again, then gazed towards Gu Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sensing that, Gu Zichen walked in front of Ye Zichen with a wry smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on?” Ye Zichen was very confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You still remember when I told you to try going out with Zuo Mo, but you refused, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You heard her call me Gu Zichen already, so I’ll tell you a bit about my background,” Gu Zichen took a deep breath. “You probably suspected me of coming from the future, but that’s not the actual truth. I am you from a parallel dimension.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Parallel? You mean more like the six dimensions theory?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Something like that,” Gu Zichen nodded. “I worked so hard to help you pave your path and help you deal with all kinds of trouble is actually just for the final result.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What result?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A new world,” Gu Zichen said seriously. “Right now, all of the parallel dimensions have gone onto the same path where the demons rule over the six realms. Some dimensions might not have succumbed yet, but it is more or less the same. It was the same for my dimension.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t quite understand it,” Ye Zichen replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s hard for you to understand since I said everything so suddenly, but even if you don’t understand, make sure you remember what I’m going to say next.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Gu Zichen shrouded where he and Ye Zichen was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Mo, who stood outside, pouted and looked begrudgingly at Gu Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In the dimensions I know about, yours is the only one that has not yet been ruled over by the demons. Theoretically speaking, as long as you can overthrow the demons’ rule, then the history of the other dimensions will be changed. Of course, the chances of you to succeed is slim as all the other dimensions have been conquered,” Gu Zichen grabbed Ye Zichen by the shoulder. “But don’t lose hope. At least this dimension has not gone down that path yet.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>You’re kidding me.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>The pressure suddenly increased massively!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>That was what Ye Zichen felt.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the hell? The demons will rule the six realms in the future? I thought the Upper Three Realms was the strongest?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What parallel dimension? The heck was that!?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But he doesn’t seem like he is messing with me. He has no need to either…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what do you need me to do?” Ye Zichen asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>An hour later, the white-robed man finally removed all of the seals around them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was in a very bad mood. He was pursing his lips as his eyebrows knitted tightly together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t be too pessimistic. Stay optimistic. I believe that you have the ability to change history,” the white-robed man patted Ye Zichen’s shoulder. Yet, despite saying that, he wasn’t so confident either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was so hopeful when he went to all the parallel dimensions before, but the results never went his way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can I ask you a final question?” Ye Zichen suddenly looked up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The white-robed man nodded, “Ask away.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did they all die?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The white-robed man turned silent. After a long while, he nodded slightly, “Don’t think about doing everything all at once. Don’t be impulsive. Take everything a step at a time. Make sure you grab onto any opportunity you get, okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know,” Ye Zichen clenched his fists tightly, then walked to the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The white-robed man stretched lazily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Mo quickly walked up to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve troubled you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop being so emotional. If you truly feel like that, then marry me,” Zuo Mo glared at the white-robed man. After a while, she twitched her mouth. “Never mind, it’s pointless.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m so sorry,” the white-robed man smiled wryly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Mo had accompanied him for several tens of thousands of years. The two of them only had each other as they struggled to survive the desperate situations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it was any other people, then they definitely might have fallen in love, but…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was unable to hold anyone in his heart after witnessing ‘her’ die right in front of his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s no need to apologize when it’s with me,” Zuo Mo punched the white-robed man lightly. “Did you decide it already? You really are going to make that move? You didn’t choose to do that in the previous dimensions. Didn’t you say that the chances of success is way too low?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have no other choices anymore. I have to bet everything on this!” Gu Zichen clenched his fist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I’ll go with you,” Zuo Mo smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Actually you…” Gu Zichen looked at her in surprise. The thing he was going to do was fraught with danger…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“An extra person gives you more chances of victory. What’s more, if we lose when both of us goes, I guess I win if we end up dying together,” Zuo Mo pursed her lips with a smile. Then she glanced at Ye Zichen. “Be nice to Zuo Mo, got it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Zuo Mo and Gu Zichen disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Approximately after five minutes of staring at where they disappeared from, Ye Zichen took a deep breath, then turned to Xuan-Yuan Xiang, “Let’s go back.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Please come back alive!</span></i></p>

 <p><b>Gu Zichen:&nbsp;</b>Heh, you&nbsp;found me.</p>
 <p><strong>Newcomer:&nbsp;</strong>I've always known where you are.</p>
 <p><strong>Gu Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>I suppose that's true...</p>
 <p><strong>Newcomer:&nbsp;</strong>(looks at Ye Zichen) Look at what you...</p>
 <p><strong>Gu Zichen:</strong>&nbsp;I decided to do this. I've decided to take that one huge risk.</p>
 <p><strong>Newcomer:&nbsp;</strong>Why?</p>
 <p><strong>Gu Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Because I have to!</p>
 <p><strong>Newcomer:&nbsp;</strong>You didn't choose to do it in all those other dimensions.</p>
 <p><strong>Gu Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>But this one is different. HE is different. Even if it's just slightly, perhaps... This will be the dimension where we turn things around.</p>
