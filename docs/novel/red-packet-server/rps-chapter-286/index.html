 <p><span style>Chapter 286 – You dare to make a move against my people?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blood dyed the night red.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had already lost count of how many snakemen he killed. There was only one thought remaining in his mind.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kill them all.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Assassinating him was fine, causing trouble for him was fine, but reaching their sinful hands towards his family…</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was something he could not tolerate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although he would be killing many by doing that, he did not care.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He did not know what dangers would await him in the future, but he must use this opportunity to tell everyone that…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Target him with their plots and tricks, that’s fine, but if you cross the line…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sorry, you’re already on the death list.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As countless snakemen fell onto the ground, a heavy scent of gore filled the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, the surrounding snakemen retreated. They were completely terrified by Ye Zichen’s slaughter. The man in front of them wasn’t a man at all, he was a true grim reaper who used his bare hands to harvest the originally lowly lives of the snakemen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When another snakeman got ripped apart by Ye Zichen, there was already no snakemen that dared to even step forward in a two meter radius around him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen laughed with a cold gaze just like a Grim Reaper mocking them. The surrounding snakemen instantly stiffened as their eyes twitched, while their retreating steps displayed their anxiety.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Hou brothers also returned to his side. When they saw the small hill of corpses around him and his cold gaze…</span></p>
 <p><span style>A shiver couldn’t help but run through their spines.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After being with Ye Zichen for so long, they had always assumed Ye Zichen was an extremely carefree person. However, at that very moment, they finally knew that savagery also flowed in Ye Zichen’s blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A woman, with a snake-like waist, wearing a thin veil poured a glass of wine for a man on a stone chair in the cave, “Leader, are we not going out yet? Our subordinates have suffered terrible losses.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man’s skin was very dark, while a patch of white shone on his right cheek. He had an eagle-like nose and triangular eyes, while his greenish hair was messy like that of a bird’s nest…</span></p>
 <p><span style>His limbs were clearly muscular and powerful underneath a black skin-tight vest and a blue jacket.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Three people laid on the straw mattress behind the man. They were Mother Ye and co.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My purpose is to capture the Yellow Emperor’s reincarnation and suck the essence from his body… As long as I can reach my goal, then their deaths do not matter!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Snakes were cold-blooded creatures, so he didn’t care about the death of his subordinates at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As long as one was powerful enough, he would always be able to gather subordinates.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait, wait till the children waste most of the spiritual energy from the Yellow Emperor and his lackeys. Only then will we go out to feel the joy of the fishermen!” The man smiled faintly and downed all the wine in his glass in one gulp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My lord, we won’t stop you anymore. Leader is in the cave right in front. Your family is also in said cave. Please have mercy on us,” A male spiritual body level snakeman stepped forward. Although he was also of the spiritual body level, he had no chance against Ye Zichen at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he saw that his side was being mown down, while the other side was getting more and more fierce…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you need, we can help you defeat leader in the cave as well. We only beg for you to let us go alive after that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please let us go alive.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The remaining snakemen all spoke up together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen squinted his eyes with a smile and walked towards the spiritual body leveled snakeman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My lord!” The snakeman lowered his head, he didn’t have the courage to meet Ye Zichen’s gaze at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You want to rally under my banner and be used by me?” Ye Zichen said in a condescending tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, yes, yes, we are willing to submit to my lord,” The snakeman immediately nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as the snakeman continuously forced a smile, Ye Zichen directly snapped his neck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Ye Zichen glanced at the Hou brothers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kill them all, leave none alive!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Howls, curses and begs filled the air!</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the remaining ten-odd snakemen had also passed onto the afterlife, the Hou brothers returned to Ye Zichen’s side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Ye, they’ve all been dealt with.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm,” Ye Zichen nodded expressionlessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Third Hou spoke up, “Boss Ye, the snakemen just now already had the intention of submitting to us. Why didn’t you chose to accept them for your own use? Ignoring those false spiritual body-level ones, the spiritual body level snakemen would have been definitely a great aid for us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe,” Ye Zichen smiled. “Snakes are cold-blooded animals. They literally just betrayed their leader, so couldn’t they just as easily betray me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that the Hou brothers understood, Ye Zichen snickered, “C’mon, it’s time for the main dish.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within the snake cave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The snakeman leader at the entrance of the cave and the snake girl beside him had waited for a long time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, whose body was drenched head to toe in blood, stopped at a place ten meters from the entrance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both the man and the woman caused him to feel threatened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yellow Emperor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows when he heard what the snakeman leader called him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I didn’t think that this guy would actually know my identity!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“How are you so sure that I’m the Yellow Emperor? Do you guys have some way of gathering information?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Actually, I wasn’t completely sure whether or not you are the Yellow Emperor’s reincarnation before this,” the snakeman smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then aren’t you afraid of killing the wrong person?” Ye Zichen sneered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So what? What can a mere mortal do to me?” The snakeman leader replied with incomparable confidence.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Indeed, he was definitely a tough enemy for normal people in the Modern Realm.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll give you a chance. Let my family go, then I won’t kill you,” Ye Zichen said expressionlessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the snakeman laughed, “Yellow Emperor’s reincarnation, you are so cute… Are you threatening me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems like you aren’t going to release them. Then I can only kill you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen immediately begun his assault with the Hou brothers following closely behind him. However, the snakeman leader smiled, while the snake girl beside him also charged out leisurely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Contrary to Ye Zichen’s expectations, the snake girl was able to mess with both the Hou brothers by herself, while Ye Zichen also felt troubled after starting to fight the snakeman leader.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“False Earth Immortal!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yellow Emperor’s reincarnation, I’m so sorry, but I’ll be taking your reincarnated blood essence.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, the snakeman directly reached his hand out towards Ye Zichen’s chest without any extra movements. It was a simple and casual attack, yet Ye Zichen could not block it at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everything was futile against absolute power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dad, that brat is going to get killed by the snakeman,” Wei Teng monitored Ye Zichen’s situation carefully behind a worn down wall nearby.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go!” Wei Chen frowned. However, he immediately squatted back down after standing up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it?” Wei Teng didn’t understand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We don’t need to care anymore,” Wei Chen, who had a look of nervousness on his face earlier, relaxed, then leisurely lit a cigarette for himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why?” Wei Teng still did not understand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen won’t die with her here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Wei Chen finished his words, a cold voice reverberated where the snakeman and Ye Zichen were fighting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You even dare to make a move on my people?”</span></p>
 <p></p>
