 <p><span style>Chapter 40 – Old Man Xiao’s Invitation</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen understood everything the moment he saw Li Jiayi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No wonder the young man could spray his car even when&nbsp;the young man&nbsp;did not know him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed like he’s someone from the Golden Spring Hotel, and remembered his car plate after checking the security tapes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only thing Ye Zichen couldn’t understand was, just how did he play with Li Jiayi’s feelings?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jiayi, stop pulling on me!&nbsp;I have to make this monster with a human’s appearance pay!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Chuang pushed back, causing Li Jiayi to fall onto the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen quickly ran over to help her up, then frowned towards Li Chuang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come at me with any issues you have with me, what are you pushing a girl around for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let go of me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Jiayi frowned, while Ye Zichen obediently let go of her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Li Chuang also ran over to Li Jiayi’s side to see if she was alright. Li Jiayi merely shook her head towards him and signaled him to get in the car.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jiayi, why are you still on his side after him doing what he did to you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his hand to stop Li Chuang from speaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I just don’t get it. What did I do to Li Jiayi? From the beginning when you randomly cursed me with the megaphone, to saying that I did something Li Jiayi… Just what did I do to her?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are the best one to be clear about what you did yourself!” Li Chuang clenched his teeth and swore. “Scum!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was truly a bit confused, he didn’t know what the situation was at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he really did something, he definitely would not push away the responsibilities, but he really didn’t do anything. Why did he have to take the blame?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Li Jiayi, tell me, what did I do to you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Jiayi directly slapped Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Some of Ye Zichen’s roommates immediately came up to him, while the surrounding students also exclaimed quietly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his hand to stop them, then licked his lips and smiled towards Li Jiayi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Li Jiayi, you’ve got you have a reason for hitting me, right? I saved you yesterday, just what do you mean by this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, let’s just say I was wrong about you. I didn’t request you to take responsibility towards me, but you don’t need to hide it like this, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How am I hiding?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I truly was wrong about you. Ye Zichen, I hate you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Jiayi pulled Li Chuang into the taxi, while Ye Zichen stood on the spot like a man made out of wood, as he stared dumbly at the taxi that disappeared from view.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just what the f*ck did I do?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi, what’s going on?” Kang Peng came over and asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even I don’t know what’s going on, what am I supposed to say when you ask me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The scene just now had truly confused Ye Zichen. When he woke up in the morning, Li Jiayi had said some weird things to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He thought that the woman had her period, and so was in a bad mood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But f*ck, she ran over to his school at noon again and said a bunch more random stuff.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the hell!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“No, Ye-zi, what does your family actually do? Is that Porsche 918 yours?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop bothering me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen swore, then looked at that Porsche, which was sprayed to the point it was unrecognizable. Then he took out his phone to call Xiao Hai so that he would come and pick up the car. After which, he just returned to the room in annoyance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where did you guys go? I wanted to find you guys! There’s a huge news in school! The student council president, Fu Chengming, appeared in the park beside the school in red underwear this morning. The thread is really heated up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhang Rui immediately started gossiping when they got back to the dorm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen twitched his mouth after hearing it. If it was known earlier, he might have been proud of his own designs for a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But now…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop looking, the headline’s about to change later.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kang Peng looked at it for a moment before throwing the phone back. Zhang Rui looked at him in confusion, while Zhu Yunbai shrugged on the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fifth Bro’s going to be on the headlines once again!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened, what happened?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It could be said that Zhang Rui was the most interested in gossip in the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He ran to Ye Zichen’s side with bare feet. Ye Zichen raised his foot and kicked him to the side, while swearing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck off.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hai-ge, I’m so sorry. The car you just gave me turned out like this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen said depressingly. Xiao Hai patted his shoulders without caring and laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You did piss off quite a lot of people. Just look at this spray, monster with a human’s appearance, just what sort of despicable thing did you do again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you mean again?” Ye Zichen twitched his mouth speechlessly. Xiao Hai also chuckled, signaled his subordinate to drive the car away, then laughed, “Do you need Hai-ge to help you deal with it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please don’t, it’s no big deal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Xiao Hai spoke about helping him deal with it, that was definitely going to destroy them completely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Chuang had sprayed the car for Li Jiayi, while Ye Zichen felt that there was certainly some misunderstanding between him and Li Jiayi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he couldn’t think of where it could be from at the moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, I’ll listen to you. If you say there’s no need, then there’s no need.” Xiao Hai held Ye Zichen’s shoulders and said. “Actually, Hai-ge came because I had some business.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I knew it, if Big Boss Hai comes in person just to take the car away, it really wouldn’t make sense,” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes as if he guessed it already.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Hai chuckled after hearing it, “I knew I wouldn’t be able to hide it from you. Hai-ge came this time to invite you over to visit my home.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not going,” Ye Zichen shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re not giving Hai-ge face?” Xiao Hai showed an angry expression. “What’s more, not only Hai-ge wants to invite you, but our family’s old man wants to thank you in person as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The old man recovered?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows, he never would have thought that the Great Recovery Pill was that useful. He should stock up some more Great Recovery Pills in the future, since they might able to save his life if he gets some sort of disease in the future.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not completely, but more or less.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Hai’s expression was filled with joy. The old man recovering was a huge joyous thing for the Xiao family.</span></p>
 <p><span style>More importantly, the burden on his shoulders had also decreased a little.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Ye Zichen called him Hai-ge, he wasn’t much older than Ye Zichen. He was only twenty-four.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had to manage such a large corporation at the age of twenty-four, and it was without any prior notice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He did have a lot of pressure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Ye, just go. The old man gave the orders, he must see you. If you don’t go, Hai-ge will also be troubled.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Hai showed a “please” expression. Ye Zichen thought about it, then raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have lessons in the afternoon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t it fine if you skip, Hai-ge skipped quite a few lessons when he was in school too. This isn’t a reason for you to refuse.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have stuff to do at night.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What stuff?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“None of your business,” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes. He made this up, but all of a sudden, he couldn’t think of a good excuse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you’re not saying it, then it’s nothing. Don’t messing with Hai-ge. You’re going if you want to, you’re still going even if you don’t want to.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Xiao Hai grabbed Ye Zichen and chucked him into the car.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shouted towards the outside, while banging on the car window.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Help, kidnapping!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Hai chuckled, then shouted at the driver.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Start driving back to the Xiao family!”</span></p>
