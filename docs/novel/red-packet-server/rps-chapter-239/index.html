 <p><span style>Chapter 239 – Chang’e, Who Got Pimples From Eating Spicy Gluten</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yellow Emperor!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He seems to have said that I am the Yellow Emperor.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen frowned at the masked man, then licked his lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You just said that I’m the Yellow Emperor!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm!” The masked man nodded in confirmation. Then he held his hand out towards the tea table and used a vacuum force to pull the packet of cigarettes on it over, while he took his mask off.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s an unexpectedly normal square face.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He lit a cigarette for himself and sucked, then breathed out a mouthful of smoke proficiently, “I really haven’t tasted tobacco for so long.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The square-faced man smoke a bit more greedily before walking to the sofa and sitting down, “It seems like you really understand yourself. Back then, before you reincarnated, you told me that if there comes a day that you can’t take it all anymore, then I was to tell everything to you. It seems like now is the time…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you saying? You sound so weird,” Ye Zichen sat down opposite and glared at him fiercely. “I said that I don’t want to play anymore…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I also told you that you can’t not continue!” Great Emperor Qingming finished the cigarette in his hand, then squelched the embers in the ashtray. “This is the path you chose for yourself back then.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Back then, you chose to go through the cycle of reincarnation in order to help the Immortal Region gain an Immortal King. Originally, I wanted to let nature follow its course, but since I’ve already said all this, then I’ll tell you. You were the Yellow Emperor in your first life!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the hell!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ve got to be kidding me! Someone just told me that I’m the reincarnation of Zhang Sanfeng, how am I the Yellow Emperor now? Just how many characters have I acted? Just how much money am I getting in return?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had made a huge decision when he accepted himself as Zhang Sanfeng’s reincarnation, and now the fact that he was the Yellow Emperor popped out of nowhere…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just how long ago was the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Zhang Sanfeng was your eighth life…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And since my first life is the Yellow Emperor, doesn’t that mean that I still have a seventh, sixth, fifth, fourth, third, and second life?” Ye Zichen smiled wryly. “Bro, you came to crack jokes, right? Me, a single person, has lived nine lives!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know that you find it very hard to understand right now. But you should have unsealed some memories recently, right?” A light flashed across Great Emperor Qingming’s eyes. “These memories are all memories from your previous lives. You’ll know more in the future, that’s when you’ll come to understand everything.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t want to understand. How about you just kill me! If you don’t kill me, then I’ll commit suicide later! I’ve had enough!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen!” Great Emperor Qingming leaped up from the sofa and spoke as if he was hating iron for not becoming steel. “Just what do you want? You’ve already been through eight lives, success is in sight. Are you going to make everything that was done before had been in vain?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Great Emperor Qingming did not notice the corner of Ye Zichen’s mouth raise in his rage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he finished, Ye Zichen twitched his mouth, “It seems like I’m very important to you, right!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, the presence of an Immortal King has an indescribable importance for the Immortal Region,” Great Emperor Qingming nodded seriously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You guys are very scared of me dying, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then let’s talk about conditions!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did Ye Zichen reveal a fox-like smile, as if his ploy had succeeded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An hour had passed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You already know what you want to know, and I’ve said what I should say…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood, go back to your Three Realms and leave here to me. I’ll stay alive properly,” Ye Zichen looked over with a satisfied gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Great Emperor Qingming stopped and frowned, “I actually shouldn’t have said all this. What I said to you might actually affect you in this life. Your tribulations near, please be extra careful.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing Great Emperor Qingming’s blabber, Ye Zichen revealed an annoyed look, “Just hurry back, I won’t treat my life as a joke.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then… See you in the Three Realms!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, the space in the room distorted once again. A black door appeared on the ceiling of the room, and Great Emperor Qingming also disappeared at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who had maintained a strong and proud look, collapsed on the sofa the moment Great Emperor Qingming left.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Phew.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The still space started moving once again. Third Fatty Jin habitually kowtowed once again before he got up quickly and smiled wryly, “Boss Ye!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, you don’t need to say it to me. I don’t want to know anymore. I’m a bit tired, so I’m going back to my room to rest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen dragged his tired body back to his bedroom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen laid down on the bed and blanked out as he looked at the ceiling.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*cking hell!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I’m actually the Yellow Emperor. This is so damn awesome!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who had looked tired just moments earlier, jumped up from the bed while his face carried even more excitement than when he found out that he was Zhang Sanfeng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had always had a slightly self-comforting mindset, as opposed to complaining and getting troubled over things, it was better to slowly accept it…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Too strong, I’ve known I wasn’t a normal person since I was young…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen muttered to himself and laughed. At the same time, Liu Qing came out of the dragon eye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she saw his idiotic smile, she immediately asked, “What made you so happy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Liu Qing, do you know who this lord is?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows cockily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing looked at him as if he was an idiot and twitched his mouth, “You’re sick in the head!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m the Yellow Emperor’s reincarnation!’</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>“Then I’m the reincarnation of Nüwa<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>! You’re insane!”</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t not believe it!” Ye Zichen licked his lips and smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing rolled her eyes at him, then reached into his pocket to take out his phone before flowing to the side to read doujinshis.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since nobody was able to share his joy, Ye Zichen began to feel slightly unhappy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nameless, are you there?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A voice suddenly rang out in Ye Zichen’s mind. Ye Zichen was stunned for a moment, then immediately realized that it was a voice transmission from Chang’e.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, Fairy, what is it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chang’e’s voice hesitated, then stopped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows, “You finished the spicy gluten?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No…” Chang’e instantly replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within the Moon Palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chang’e covered her face with a white veil. However, her worries could be seen through the view.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She bit her lips. As she held a bronze mirror and looked at herself, she sighed for some reason.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what happened?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen’s query sounded out in Chang’e’s mind, she frowned even more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a long while, she took out her phone as if she made a hard decision, took out her phone to take a selfie, which she sent to Ye Zichen on WeChat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why is someone always finding you on this shitty phone?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing, who was reading a doujinshi chucked the phone over angrily. Ye Zichen caught the phone, then saw that Chang’e had sent him a photo on WeChat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She definitely wasn’t called the number one beauty in the Heavenly Court for nothing. She had a face that mesmerized people without any make-up and features were clearly natural. </span><i><span style>This should be Chang’e.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen saw that…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two pimples grew near Chang’e’s upper lip.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck, what’s going on? Did she get pimples from eating spicy gluten?</span></i></p>
