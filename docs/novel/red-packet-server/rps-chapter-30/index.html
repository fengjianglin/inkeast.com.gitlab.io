 <p><span style>Chapter 30 – Mighty</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is a new dress from the Paris Fashion Week. A hundred and thirty thousand!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman raised her chin with a hint of pride in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A hundred and thirty thousand. Alright, I’ll pay you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei took out a card from her purse without any hesitation and threw it at the woman’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s two hundred thousand on the card, no need for change!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is this the attitude of you apologizing?” The woman frowned and screamed at Xiao Yumei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you really think that I’m apologizing to you here?” Xiao Yumei suddenly smiled. She twitched her mouth and looked at the woman, then said coldly. “This is only my compensation for the trouble my child has caused. Now that we have already compensated you for your dress, it’s time for me to talk about your compensation for hitting my child.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Xiao Yumei took out two hundred thousand without any hesitation, the people in the hall all knew that this wasn’t going to end well for the loud woman.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>As expected, now she was going to deal with you.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ Tiantian, who was in her arms, was still in deep pain. As everyone in the hall heard the heart-tearing cries of the child, they all felt pity for her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei also patted Lil’ Tiantian’s head with pain in her heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nice, Tiantian, don’t cry, Mommy will get revenge for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she comforted Tiantian’s emotions, Xiao Yumei looked over towards the woman and smiled coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fifty million, that’s it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You went insane for money, right!” The woman screamed out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you don’t have fifty million, then I want the hand that you hit Tiantian with just now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was impossible to imagine what it felt like for such a beautiful woman like Xiao Yumei to say something like that to another human being.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen also watched the scene in shock. Mei-jie was not someone so impulsive from what he remembered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, when he thought about Tiantian’s situation, Ye Zichen quickly understood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tiantian was her scale, she would fight anyone who dared to hurt Tiantian, with her life on the line.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before the woman spoke, Xiao Yumei already started to make a call.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hu-ge, right? Yes, this is Xiao Yumei, I want you to help me deal with a person. Five million. I want one of her hands. Yes, I’m at Wansheng Real Estate’s sales center, just send someone over.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman who had hit Tiantian, never thought that Xiao Yumei was actually serious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She reached out to grab Xiao Yumei’s phone, only to get stopped by Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Be quiet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Lil’ Tiantian saw Ye Zichen, she slowly stopped crying and muttered while rubbing her nose.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Daddy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good Tiantian, don’t cry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s face was full of a warm smile as he rubbed Tiantian’s cheeks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as if his voice was filled with magic, causing Lil’ Tiantian to really stop crying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tiantian.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei’s eyes were still filled with worry as the hand mark on Tiantian’s cheeks was still completely visible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From this, they were able to tell just how much strength the woman had placed into the slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are committing a crime here. I’m going to call the police.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So what if it’s a crime?” Xiao Yumei suddenly laughed coldly. “From the moment, you slapped Tiantian, you were sentenced to death in my heart. One of your hands is just the interest. Don’t doubt that I have ten million ways to make you silently disappear from this world.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A roar sounded out from outside the mansion sales area as a man walked in with a frown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man looked very normal, but it was unknown why everyone would subconsciously establish confidence about him when they saw him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman, who was terrified of Xiao Yumei, quickly ran towards the man the moment he appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wen-ge, you finally came. If you had come any later, you might not be able to see me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the woman spoke out her troubles in tears, Ye Zichen noticed that Xiao Yumei’s face instantly turned pale when the man appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hao Wen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yumei?” Hao Wen momentarily blanked out, then quickly walked towards Xiao Yumei. “Yumei, how have you been all these years?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop pretending here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei suddenly laughed, while a distant feeling that caused people to be unable to approach her appeared in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We aren’t familiar with each other, please stay away from me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No matter what, we were once husband and wife, is there a need to go to this extreme?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wow.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The entire hall of people instantly exclaimed. They never would have thought that these two people in front of them had such a relationship.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Being with you once was due to me being blind.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, a group of muscular men wearing black vests walked in. The one in the lead was a bald man wearing a thick golden necklace and a vest with a tiger printed on it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Director Xiao.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hu-ge, you came.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He, I will go in person for all large-scale businesses. Say it, who’s hand do you want?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hu-ge touched his bald head, while his eyes shone with murderous light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hers!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei’s gaze instantly turned cold, as she pointed towards the woman beside Hao Wen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Capture her…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wen-ge!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The girl yelled. Hao Wen’s eyes twitched as he looked at Xiao Yumei questioningly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you doing!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not much, she hit Tiantian. I’m going to make her pay. Oh, yeah, it’s fine if you pay for her as well. Five million!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Director Xiao, it isn’t quite right for I, Tiger, right? You are asking for five million in one go and only give Tiger five hundred thousand…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The bald Hu-ge touched his head. Xiao Yumei also chuckled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hu-ge, I, Xiao Yumei am not that sort of stingy person. He might not even pay. If he really does, then how about I double it for Hu-ge?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Director Xiao is generous!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hu-ge raised his thumb towards Xiao Yumei, then spoke to his subordinates.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you guys blanking out for? Control her. With Director’s Xiao’s word, chop this woman’s hand off.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiao Yumei!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop wasting my breath, either pay, or I’ll take one of her hands.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei’s eyes were filled with a madness. When Hao Wen saw her gaze, his heart froze for some reason.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He did not doubt the truth in Xiao Yumei’s words at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She really could do anything for Tiantian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, I’ll pay! Let Han Jing go!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hao Wen took out a cheque from his pocket, wrote down five million and handed it to Xiao Yumei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen could clearly see that her hand shuddered intensely when she saw him take out the cheque.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, thank you, Director Hao. Hu-ge, let her go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let her go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hu-ge kicked his underling, causing the underling to let go of Han Jing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Hao Wen left the mansion area with Han Jing, Hu-ge laughed loudly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Director is truly a big boss, earning five million just like that. It’s so much quicker than us, who just know how to fight, and it’s also a lot safer!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hu-ge is funny. I will wire a million to your account tonight.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s fine, that’s fine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, Hu-ge left the sales center with his underlings. Only when they left did everyone in the sales center let out a sigh of relief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was fortunate that no blood had been shed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mei-jie…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When those that should leave had left, Ye Zichen walked beside Xiao Yumei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he got closer, Ye Zichen saw a faint trace of tears in Xiao Yumei’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She grasped the cheque worth five million tightly with her right hand, then…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rip.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She ripped the cheque and threw it onto the floor. Everyone in the hall looked at the scene in shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Five million.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She ripped it just like that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Other people could not understand Xiao Yumei, but Ye Zichen can.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, can you hug me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded with a smile, and pulled Xiao Yumei into his arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The next moment…</span></p>
 <p><span style>She started crying unrestrainedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s right!</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter how mighty Xiao Yumei was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was somethings that couldn’t be changed…</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was a woman…</span></p>
 <p><span style>A woman that also needed a man to lean on.</span></p>
