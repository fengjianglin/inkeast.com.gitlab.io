 <p><span style>Chapter 756 – The Clan Head</span></p>
 <p><span style>The clan head election.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ceremony that should have been held when the demons invaded was finally ongoing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Zuo Clan was definitely the top clan in the outer regions of the Immortal Region, so the ceremony was naturally very grand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The people who were close to the Treasure Tower or just reputed in the Immortal Region were all there to witness the crowning of the future master of the Treasure Tower.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, most of them were already certain of who it was going to be.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Zuo Clan did have many branches, but only those from the main branch could become the Clan Head. Out of them, Zuo Mo was the sole child of the current clan head and was very close with Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They all knew that Zuo Mo was definitely going to be the future master of the Treasure Tower if everything goes right.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many of the people actually went in order to present their gifts to Zuo Mo after she becomes the clan head due to Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was basically certain and Zuo Mo thought so as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Elders, please explain all of this to me,” Zuo Mo frowned and glared at the elders who sat within the conference room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just now, when the elders voted for the clan head, the winner was not Zuo Mo, nor was it even Zuo Qingcheng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was Zuo Liang!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Mo glared angrily at the clan elders, then turned to Zuo Liang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Liang was wearing a grand black robe of silk. It was something he never dared to dress in before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everything made it seem like he dressed himself up for that day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And with all that, he seemed extremely handsome.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Sister Zuo Mo, they announced the results again, why are you trying to make things difficult for our elders,” Zuo Liang smirked. It was clear that he was very proud and was unable to hide his excitement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked at Zuo Mo with a smug look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Indeed.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The day is finally here.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“We are brother and sister. Even when I inherit the position of the clan head, you have no need to worry, I will let you live a life of splendor and riches.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zuo Liang!” Zuo Mo stared at the person of her in confusion. She could not believe that Zuo Liang would actually step forth and say those words with that look in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sis, I’ve had enough,” Zuo Liang stepped forward, then shook his head with a snort. “Seriously, I've had enough.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His expression turned sullen. He stared at Zuo Mo’s stark white face coldly and sneered, “Do you know how long I’ve been waiting for this day? Zuo Mo, you are not even close to being as talented as me in business. Did you know that you were merely a crying baby girl when I made my first major business deal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I really am thankful for the Zuo Clan. You brought me here and changed my life greatly. In order to repay you guys, I studied the art of business diligently. All of that was just so you can give me some more respect. Do you know how much I gave up for that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you trying to say?” Zuo Mo frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hah…” Zuo Liang laughed. He waved his hand proudly over the elders with blurred eyes. “Can’t you tell? I’m going to be the clan head. This clan head position is mine. It’s MINE!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A wave of commotion overcame the guests.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s going on?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>An internal argument in the clan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One between the eldest daughter and the adopted son?</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the guests could now tell that Zuo Liang plotted this for a long time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Something to note was that the elders were acting very strangely. They all looked forward emotionlessly as if someone was controlling them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many guests tried to silently use some calming techniques on the elders, but none of them worked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Should we do something about it?” Xia Keke looked at everything with wide eyes. The girls had also come because of Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t think it’s a good idea,” Su Yan frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But we can’t let that guy be the clan head.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Xia Keke didn’t like Zuo Mo, those feelings were limited to their relationship with Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She didn’t want something that should belong to Zuo Mo end up in someone else’s hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Especially not in the hands of Zuo Liang, someone she didn’t really like.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How though?” Xiao Yumei, who was holding Tiantian, whispered. “No matter what happens, this is the Zuo Clan, we have no right to interfere with their clan. There are plenty of people who are friends of Zuo Mo, but did they do anything?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The girls looked around and saw Ruan Qingtian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was very good friends with Zuo Mo. At that moment, he was looking at Zuo Liang sullenly with clenched fists. However, he remained still on his seat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We are just outsiders, getting involved recklessly would only make things worse for Zuo Mo. I saw Stone and Xue Qi hurry out. They should have gone to find Zichen. It’ll be fine when Zichen arrives,” Xiao Yumei smoke in a manner as expected of the eldest amongst them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then let’s wait for Big Brother Zichen,” Xia Keke nodded obediently, then pouted and waved her fist. “I’m so angry. I want to beat that guy to a pulp and feed him to Lil’ White.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ White, who had taken the human form of a handsome young man, looked at Xia Keke speechlessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…” Zuo Mo clenched her teeth and shuddered in anger. She ran towards Zuo Liang, only for Zuo Qingcheng to smile and send out several Sky Immortal level guest chamberlains to stop Zuo Mo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, the guest chamberlains stepped forth and matched Zuo Qingcheng’s guest chamberlains.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are working together now?” asked Zuo Mo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have no choice, letting Zuo Liang be the clan head is better than letting you take the spot,” Zuo Qingcheng giggled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Hongxin also stepped forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My great niece, it’s an election, anybody has a chance. There is no need for you to mind it so much,” with that, he turned to Zuo Hongde, who was sitting in the very center. “Big Brother, who do you think the clan head should be?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, Zuo Hongde, the clan head, became the center of attention.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The elders only gave advice, the final result should still be announced by Zuo Hongde.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those with better eyesight instantly noticed at Zuo Hongde was now facing emotionlessly in front of him just like the others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Zuo Hongde opened his seemingly sleepy eyes. “The position… of… clan… head… belongs to… Zuo… Liang!”</span></p>
