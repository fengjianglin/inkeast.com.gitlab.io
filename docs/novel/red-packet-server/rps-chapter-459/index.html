 <p><span style>Chapter 459 – Making Things Difficult</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Ye Zichen was about to sleep, he heard the phone beside him ring. He immediately rolled over and picked up the phone and looked at the news.</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: Done!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows, then clicked into the group, and found that both Yang Jian and Nezha spoke up within the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Hahaha, this great lord is out!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha: Hahaha, this little lord is out!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>These two kids… It seems like they’re in a pretty good mood after leaving the Cloudy Palace of the Golden Arches.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: Oh wow, you guys came out. How was it? That geezer Jade Emperor didn’t make it difficult for you guys, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: It’s good that you’re out. It really good that you’re out!</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: What happened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King Li: Shitty brat, what are you getting hyped in the group for? Hurry up and screw off back home. Just watch me beat you up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha: You can’t beat me in a fight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King Li: &lt;insert a black face emoji&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Friends, thank you for your care. We only went over to the Cloudy Palace of the Golden Arches as part of the procedure. We still have our control over the armies, our wages remain the same, and we’re still free!</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: … Seriously?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Hehe, why would I lie to you? Ask Nezha if you don’t believe me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha: What Big Brother Yang Jian said is true.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone in the group were completely shocked. All of them saw how dark the Jade Emperor’s expression was, he looked like he was about to rip Yang Jian and Nezha apart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, they actually returned to the group said that nothing happened, and they didn’t get punished at all…</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, they thought of what Sky Sovereign Nameless said earlier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Sky Sovereign is truly a capable person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mother of Lightning: Agreed!</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Fortune: Agreed!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: Agreed!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: Agreed!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A huge group of deities replied just like that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, Yang Jian couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: What did my bro do?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: It seems like I, Old Sun, was wrong again. Amazing, truly amazing. The reason you could actually come out was thanks to your bro.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While the deities in the group spammed the chat, Ye Zichen’s worried heart was finally able to rest when he saw Yang Jian and Nezha come out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thanks.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: Welcome. Remember, you owe me a promise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded, and the system notification said no more. As Ye Zichen watched the system notifications gradually disappear, Ye Zichen’s eyes were filled with confusion.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He could actually persuade the Jade Emperor. Then that clearly means that he’s someone of the same level or even higher.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But he said that he can’t order the Six Realms Patroller around, so could he… be someone from the Upper Three Realms?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shook his head, then put his phone aside before laying down on the bed to rest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the next morning, when the sky just turned bright, Ye Zichen, who would be sleeping soundly in the Modern Realm, was dragged up by someone else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He yawned tiredly. He had drank plenty of strong alcohol, and had stayed up very late to deal with the Heavenly Court’s matters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He only slept for a total of less than four hours, which was far too little compared to the ten-odd hours he used to sleep before…</span></p>
 <p><span style>It would be strange if he wasn’t sleepy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kid, it seems like you’re a lazy-ass as well,” Stone carried a huge axe on his shoulder and chuckled. “Laozi likes to sleep in as well, so I was not very used to it when I just started working, but look… Right now, laozi already went around and hunted a few animals first before coming to get you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright,” Ye Zichen yawned again, then blinked. “It’s so early, where are you taking me to?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course it’s to work,” Stone raised his eyebrows. “Kid, if you don’t work hard, then how can you get married.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright!” Ye Zichen nodded lifelessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kid, you know too little since you just arrived in our village. You need to work to earn money in order to eat, drink and feed your wife. Also, the house you’re living in belongs to Old’ Xue. You can’t live there after he gets married. So work more, then buy a piece of land in the village and build a house there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood,” Ye Zichen smiled. For some reason, he felt like the village seemed to give of the feeling of an ancient tribe. However, he felt like that was pretty nice too, since the people that worked harder lives better. It was very fair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh yeah, Big Brother Stone, where are you taking me to work?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha, Big Brother Stone naturally has to take care of you. This big brother is taking you to that lode,” Stone chuckled. “Xue Qi said it already. The first ten kilograms we harvest will all be handed over to the village, after that, thirty percent will be for yourself, sixty percent for the village’s construction and development, and the last ten percent for the discoverer… Let me tell you, this is a good job, and the quotas are limited. Big brother spent a lot of effort in getting this spot for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you Big Brother Stone,” Ye Zichen smiled sincerely, while he praised Xue Qi silently in his heart. </span><i><span style>It seems like this village chief is rather capable.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two of them finally arrived at the lobe about an hour later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen originally thought that they were already over there very early, but when he finally arrived, he noticed that many men were already there and were waving their pickaxes around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Some of them would also occasionally shout out how much they mined, making it a very lively scene.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You see that? There are plenty of hard workers in our village. If you don’t work hard, then all of the girls will be taken. Our village does have plenty of nice girls.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I get it, I get it.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This Big Brother Stone is funny, everything he talks about revolves around girls… But then again, I suppose getting married with a girl is very important for this village’s development.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did he come as well?” At that moment, a woman in a plain long dress walked out form the mine.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked up and saw that it was Lil’ Yu, who he had met yesterday.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I got a spot for this kid. He’s new, so we naturally have to take care of him!” Stone was clearly very scared of the woman, so he didn’t even dare speak up about what he normally talked about.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm, then let him go, don’t say I don’t take care of new people. You guys see that place on the right without anyone else? The stuff there should be black iron ores. Let him go over there… Those will definitely sell a good price,” Lil’ Yu replied as she hugged her shoulders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Stone squinted his eyes, “Lil’ Yu, that’s a bit too much! Black Iron Ores are extremely dense, even Spiritual Body leveled experts take a lot of effort in excavating them, and he’s just of the body tempering levell.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Stone has checked before that the person beside him was only around level seven or eight of the body tempering level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aren’t you just making things difficult for him? Those bronze ores over there seems nice. Little bro, go over there,” Stone stuffed the pickaxe into Ye Zichen’s hand and pushed him over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ Yu smiled, then blocked him off with a shake of her head, “No. Xue Qi said that I’m in charge of organizing work here. He must go over there!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Yu!” Stone glared at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen shook his head and grabbed Stone’s shoulder, “Big Brother Stone, I’ll go!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen walked over.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Spiritual Body leveled people can’t mine it, but would I, an Earth Immortal, be unable to?</span></i></p>
 <p></p>

 <p></p>
 <p>Spiritual Breeze Village, a semi-paradise in a place near the Immortal Region. As expected of a protagonist, Ye Zichen landed in a village that is being bullied by another one.</p>
 <p>However, due to his quick wits, he was able to immediately help out the villagers and earn their trust.</p>
 <p>Xue Qi, Xue Lan, Stone... All three of them had welcomed him to the village with open arms. Yet... Just how long could his identity as the ascender be kept? Is Ye Zichen going to finally be able to enjoy a peaceful life for a while? Or is trouble already brewing?</p>
