 <p><span style>Chapter 222 – The First Voice Message</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What happened with everyone in the Heavenly Court? A bunch of friend requests with curses, while a bunch of people left messages to congratulate me…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Lü, this sovereign truly doesn’t understand what you guys are talking about. Just what happened?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, Brother Nameless, you’re in the wrong here,” Lü Dongbin replied with a smile. “Although we have never met before, we’re already family just by you helping our Old Han. You actually didn’t tell us such a huge thing first!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just what is it!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Never mind, I’ll stop teasing Brother Nameless. Your thing with Fairy Chang’e is known in throughout the Heavenly Court now. Brother Nameless, you are amazing for actually gaining the number one beauty in the Heavenly Court!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the message, there was a row of thumbs up emojis.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s hand shuddered.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>My thing with Fairy Chang’e is exposed.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Although he managed to guess approximately what happened, based on his trust for Yue Lao, he still had a hint of hope…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I wonder what business between Fairy Chang’e and I is Brother Lü talking about?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is no need to hide it now, is there? Of course it is your relationship with Fairy Chang’e. I wonder when Brother Nameless is holding the feast, we, the Eight Immortals, will definitely be there!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck you!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nearly chucked his phone out of the car when he read the news.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His face instantly turned as black as Lord Bao’s. [1. Lord Bao (包公) is a famous government official during the Song Dynasty. He was mainly famous for 2 things.</span></p>
 <p><span style>1)</span><span style>His uprightness</span></p>
 <p><span style>2)</span><span style>His dark skin]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Yue Lao, f*ck you!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>They say that people without facial hair can’t be replied on. </span></i><span style><span><a id="footnoteref-2" href="#footnote-2">[2]</a></span></span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Yue Lao already has a huge beard, and had promised with certainty that he wouldn’t tell others. In less than a day, everyone in the Heavenly Court already knew.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clenched his teeth…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao’s profile picture suddenly jumped to the top of Ye Zichen’s chat, while the red “1” nearly caused Ye Zichen to clench his teeth until they shattered.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He still dares to come and find me.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, I came to admit my wrongs and ask for punishment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao held a cigarette in his right hand, while smoke swirled around the entire celestial manor. His expression was also full of worry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sky Sovereign Nameless and Fairy Chang’e’s news was in heated discussion in the Heavenly Court. It was a lie if he said that he didn’t know about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although he felt annoyed at Old Lord Taishang and True Lord Erlang, but what can he do about it? He shouldn’t have wanted to gain that little bit of benefit!</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no helping it, he could only apologize first in order to beg for a lighter punishment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who sat in the car, laughed. It was a laugh of anger caused by the geezer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, I only accidentally mentioned it to Old Lord Taishang and True Lord Erlang while we were playing cards. After that, I did tell them not to spread it around, but who would have thought… This is all on me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao placed himself in a really low position.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen licked his lips and snorted with a laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is your fault.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I ask Sky Sovereign to be the bigger person. I will try my best to help you out and prevent the effects of the discussion in the Heavenly Court.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You focused on the wrong thing,” Ye Zichen let out a sigh. “Although I’m one of the victims, no matter what, I’m still a guy. You should think about Fairy Chang’e. Now that the news has been spread, what is she going to do in the Heavenly Court?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign is right!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop kissing ass here. If you have the time to do that, you should think about a strategy to deal with this instead. As for how I’ll deal with you in the future, that would depend on how you handle this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, yes, yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A ray of hope rose in Yue Lao’s heart after he saw the message. </span><i><span style>At least there’s still chance for salvation.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao put his phone back in his pocket, then called over the two celestial children standing guard outside the door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Esteemed Master!” Both celestial children bowed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao put out the cigarette in his hand, then squinted his eyes, “Go and hire the fifty cents army for me. Spread the news that the red string between Sky Sovereign Nameless and Fairy Chang’e Is a rumor and not to be believed!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Back at Ye Zichen’s home, Third Fatty Jin sat on the sofa like a master, while Di Tian wore an apron and did housework like a housewife.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Ye,” Third Fatty Jin quickly jumped down from the sofa when he saw Ye Zichen etner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t annoy me, I’m in a bad mood.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pushed Third Fatty Jin to the side, then returned to his bedroom. Di Tian, who was doing housework, took a peek…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you looking at? Do your job properly!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Di Tian instantly frowned when he heard that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Fatty Jin raised his eyebrows, “What, you can’t accept it? Boss Hou!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Hou brothers suddenly appeared in the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Fatty Jin quickly acted like he was enraged and cursed, “Boss Hou, this grandson glared at our Boss Ye!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ding dang dong…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who was in the bedroom, ignored the situation outside. At that moment, he was was troubled over Fairy Chang’e’s situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, you finally came back,” Liu Qing came out of the Dragon Eye by the bedside table, then floated to Ye Zichen’s side with a happy look and reached out her hand. “Phone!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can’t let you use it now,” Ye Zichen frowned, then let out a sigh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Monkey King mentioned you in the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing this message, Ye Zichen felt like his head was going to explode. </span><i><span style>What is this Monkey Bro doing? It was whatever that he didn’t help, but why did he do the exact opposite!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen opened the chat group…</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: I heard news just now that said Sky Sovereign Nameless and Fairy Chang’e’s news is fake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mother of Lightning: I heard that too.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: Hey, what are you just guessing for? Isn’t it fine if we just call the two of them out! @Only Idealism @Chang’e.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: The Great Sage is brave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King Li: Watching the show.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha: Watching the show.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: Why did Old Li come as well? @Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King Li, you like this sort of gossip too?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha: hehe, I just used my dad’s phone to transfer pocket money to me in secret, I used the wrong phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Gang: I need an explanation!</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the looks of it, Yue Lao had already started the salvation procedures. However, what troubled Ye Zichen was that the monkey really knew how to cause trouble.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, the Sky Sovereign Nameless they’re talking about is you, right? What happened with you and Chang’e?” Liu Qing floated on the side with a look of curiosity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen licked his lips and smiled wryly, “The Heavenly Court is talking about a red string linking Chang’e and I…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It can’t be, you aren’t even letting deities off now?” Liu Qing revealed a look of shock with an opened mouth. Then, she quickly shrugged. “Yeah, that’s more like it. As long as the woman’s pretty, you won’t let them go!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen did not have any spare effort to care about Liu Qing’s retort. He merely looked at the messages that kept on moving up in the chat. At this moment, Chang’e appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chang’e: What did Great Sage @ me for?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s over!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s heart chilled. From the looks of it, Chang’e did not know the situation before hand, but this mention…</span></p>
 <p><span style>In order to prevent Chang’e from seeing the news the damn deities in the group will say, Ye Zichen immediately spoke up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only Idealism: @Chang’e, PM!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both of them appeared, and it was one after another.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The group instantly exploded once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All sorts of questions filled the screen, but both litigants, Chang’e and Ye Zichen, had already went to private chat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, what’s going on the group? They seem to be talking about us…”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>She still saw it in the end.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen let out a long sigh, then replied apologetically.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry, Fairy. I caused you to get disturbed like this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The face of Chang’e, who was within the Moon Palace, was bright red. She had skimmed over the chat history when she opened the group chat, then knew that her thing with Sky Sovereign Nameless went public in the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She did feel a hint of a crush on Sky Sovereign Nameless, but she had never made it clear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Especially in this sort of situation, the one that could feel it was only Sky Sovereign Nameless…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Ye Zichen pondered about how to explain…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chang’e sent another message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A voice message.</span></p>
 <p></p>

 <p><strong>Monkey King:&nbsp;</strong>@Only Idealism, come out. I, Old Sun, your bro, needs an explanation.</p>
 <p><strong>God of Thunder:&nbsp;</strong>Yeah! We need explanations! How could you be so cruel to us!</p>
