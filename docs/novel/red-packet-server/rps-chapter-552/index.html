 <p><span style>Chapter 552 – Staying at the Snow Rabbit Clan</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sire, did you manage to find anything?” The first thing Xue Lian did after Ye Zichen and co. returned to the village was check on her children, then she walked over to Ye Zichen with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We didn’t get anything, but we can be certain that the thing we want is within that forest. However, there is a seal on the outside of it. We wish to bother you here for a few days, I wonder if it Is possible?” Ye Zichen asked humbly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sire, you staying here is the honor of the Snow Rabbit Clan, but…” Xue Lian took a look over at the burnt houses in the surroundings and revealed a troubled expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No worries!” With that, Ye Zichen gave Yang Jian a cue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I knew you would make me work,” Yang Jian twitched his mouth, then pointed at the wooden pillars that would take several people to lift up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“About this…” All of the surrounding Snow Rabbit clan members were shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Yang Jian glanced over at them. “Tell me how I should place it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Through Ye Zichen and Yang Jian’s cooperation, they were able to complete a project that would have taken several days in just a short while. More importantly, due to Ye Zichen being the director of the construction, it did give off a slight feel of the Modern Realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Clan Chief Xue, can you please arrange a room for us?” Ye Zichen smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sire, thank you so much for your help. You are too courteous to tell me to arrange a room for you. You were the one who built all the houses, so choose whichever one you desire,” Xue Lian did not dare to arrange a room for them at all. From what Yang Jian had done just moments prior, she was already certain that he was the Lord Monarch.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>But this Lord Monarch seems to obey the words of the other Sire, and that other Sire is very scared of the woman.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>That was enough for her to see that the Lord Monarch was at the very bottom of the pyramid! Since the monarch was at the bottom, she naturally did not dare to say anything reckless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The guest should do as the master says, but since Clan Chief Xue said so, then we’ll pick this one,” Ye Zichen randomly pointed at a wooden house with three rooms within.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xue Lian freaked out after seeing that, “Sire, this house is too small for you all to live in!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No worries, I feel like it’s quite nice. Alright, Clan Chief Xue, don’t mind us. Everybody’s tired after a day of hard work. Go and take care of your clansmen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen walked towards the wooden hut.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian and Zuo Mo shrugged as they looked at each other and followed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian was a rather insensitive person, so he quickly fell asleep when he got to the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Zuo Mo looked out of the window in the living room, and muttered, “I really didn’t expect myself to actually come over to where the half-beastmen are. I had thought that I would never come to such dangerous places in my entire life, and would definitely not live here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are plenty of other things you don’t expect would happen. Think about how old you are… There is still a long road ahead of you,” Ye Zichen smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s all because of you,” Zuo Mo rolled her eyes. “My life has changed ever since I got to know you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It became more colorful, right?” Ye Zichen pursed his lips and smiled, then took out his phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His chat with Yue Lao was at the very top with ten-odd new messages.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: Sky Sovereign.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: Sky Sovereign?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: Sky Sovereign, please reply after you see this message!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: Sky Sovereign, um, did you guys enter. If you did, then can you return the Divine Stones to me?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: Sky Sovereign, can you not act like that monkey? We’re civilized people!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen could tell that Yue Lao wanted to get the Divine Stones back. </span><i><span style>But the stones seemed to have been taken away by that person after he broke the seal.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“The Divine Dragon’s envoy took the Divine Stones away. I didn’t take them for myself! If you want, then go and collect them once again!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, your excuse is too terrible!” Yue Lao replied instantly. “Envoy of the Divine Dragon. Are you kidding me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why would I lie to you? I used the Dragon Balls to summon the Divine Dragon. The Divine Dragon sent his envoy to break the seal. After fulfilling my wish, he took the Dragon Balls away so that they would wait for another person to collect them all once again to summon it!” Ye Zichen replied seriously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What Dragon Balls? What Divine Dragon!?” Yue Lao was completely stunned. “Sky Sovereign, I used several tens of years to collect those Divine Stones…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you still not believe me? You’ve never watched Dragon Ball, right? Wait a moment!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen scrolled through the videos on his phone, and sent Yue Lao one of the Dragon Ball episodes he had downloaded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You will be charged a 130000 cultivation experience streaming fee to send this video. Would you like to proceed?</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Since when did I have to pay a streaming fee!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen cursed the system a few times in his heart, but he still chose to proceed with it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoosh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The video was directly sent over with no upload time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, what did you send me?” Yue Lao asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dragon Ball. You’ll know what the Dragon Balls and the Divine Dragon are after watching it. Remember to ask me for the following episodes after you finish.” With that, Ye Zichen returned his phone to his pocket.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he turned around, he saw that Zuo Mo had already sat down beside him, and was staring at where he put the phone away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can you let me have a look?” Zuo Mo blinked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Look at what?” Ye Zichen shook his head. “If you want to see my social network, then no way!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, I want to see the Dragon Ball you talked about.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Ye Zichen was unable to withstand Zuo Mo’s pestering, he still ended up handing his phone over and opening the first episode of Dragon Ball for her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After reminding her over and over again not to click into other places, he returned to his room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Beast Fire. Mount Supreme. The jade pendant, which appeared on Mount Biluo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although they seemed totally unrelated, it really was intriguing for them to appear at the same time at the same place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but sigh with a shake of his head.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>System, did you set this up?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Also, Ye Zichen was no foolish enough to believe that the black robed person who helped them break through the formation was truly an envoy of the Divine Dragon. </span><i><span style>Just who was he?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, Ye Zichen felt like everything became far more complicated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, he gradually fell asleep while being deep in thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the night passed by in the blink of an eye, Ye Zichen walked out of his room, only to notice that neither Yang Jian nor Zuo Mo was around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked out the window. Everyone in the Snow Rabbit Clan were running towards the outside of the village with brooms and hoes in their hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lord Envoy, this is the village closest to the place you talked out,” a cat-eyed man smiled coyly and stood beside a humanoid man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right,” the man nodded in satisfaction. “Then let’s choose this place to be our camp.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The cat-eyed man walked over to the village with the man’s support and snorted with a savage sneer, “Xue Lian, go and rest elsewhere. We, the Emerald Leopard Clan have taken this spot.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“On what ground? We, the Snow Rabbit Clan has lived here for several hundred years. What right do you have to make us leave!?” Xue Lian bit her lips angrily, but what she felt more of was resentment…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why does every single race want to bully us snow rabbits? We merely don’t want to fight with others, but is endless insults all we’re going to get in return for repeated concessions?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Her eyes gradually watered, but at that very moment, Ye Zichen walked over with a meaningful smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Call yourself Emerald Kittens when that’s all you are. Leopard? Are you even worthy?”</span></p>
