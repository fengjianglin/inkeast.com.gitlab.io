 <p><span style>Sizzle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A red bonfire suddenly started to burn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within a hall of the palace, twelve chairs were situated around a long black table. One of the chairs was empty, while the rest were filled with men and women of various different characteristics.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What does our lord want us to say?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s clearly your thoughts about the Fallen,” the man on the throne smiled. “I want to hear what you all think!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That isn’t a Fallen. If what little fellow Qiu Yin said was true, then that Fallen is actually the son of a saint and a demon!” said the red-hair and red-clothed man with a huge sword strapped to his back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Back then, the Demon Emperor said that only those who possesses the bloodline of a saint and a demon can take that final step. I feel that we, the demon race, have to fight for this child of a saint and demon,” the one who spoke was an elder with completely white hair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Son of a saint and demon, that sounds really amazing!” an extremely beautiful woman spoke up. She licked her lips, while excitement flashed across her alluring eyes. “I wonder how he tastes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I feel like we don’t need to care about him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, one of the eleven raised a different opinion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh?” the man on the throne raised his eyebrows. “Tell me your reasoning.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It takes extremely long for a child of a saint and a demon to grow. It’s not like we, the demon race, did not have anyone of them before, but did anyone of them grow to the level of a demon sovereign?” the long-haired man said coldly. “If we chuck in large amounts of resources on them, then it’ll cause the younger generation of our race to have a pitiful amount of resources. Yet, this is the sort of result we end up with after investing in countless resources! Back then, the demon emperor did say those words, but… Is what the demon emperor said the absolute truth?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone in the hall set their gazes on the man. The long-haired man laughed, and continued, “Breakthrough requires talent and effort. If we have the time, then it’s better used on cultivation. Our main focus should be on the Yellow Emperor’s reincarnation. Even if that child of a saint and demon is truly very talented, we’ll just snatch him over when we discover that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you guys think? the man on the throne smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An older elder voiced his opinion. “I still feel like we should bring him back here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe… since the opinions are not unanimous, then I shall decide!” the man on the throne touched his lips. “The Yellow Emperor’s reincarnation is naturally the focus of the attention of our race, but we can’t give up on that child of a saint and a demon. Isn’t Lianhua in the Modern Realm? We’ll just leave it to her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Agreed!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Agreed!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Agreed!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone nodded in agreement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man on the throne also nodded, “Alright, then that’s it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, a man holding a strand of foxtail grass in his mouth smiled outside the palace, “Child of a saint and a demon. Interesting!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, this really is a blessed place!” Yang Jian wore a Hawaiian-tourist like costume with black sunglasses as he stared at the white legs of the passing girls on the streets, as he squatted on the side of the road like a rascal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though Ye Zichen used the Plantain Fan, the strength of it was still on the small side for a great deity like Yang Jian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he was fanned off once, he understood that Ye Zichen wanted the Plantain Fan, so he did not mention selling the fan after returning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s alright.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had wanted to catch some rest, but Yang Jian had dragged him out, so he could not reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since he had no choice, Ye Zichen could only squat with him on the road-side and look at the legs of the passing girls.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, look at that one… And that one… My god, is this really the mortal realm? Back when I didn’t become a deity, the girls weren’t this pretty!” Yang Jian continuously exclaimed as if he discovered a new continent. Then, he patted Ye Zichen’s shoulder with a smile. “Bro, pretty good! No wonder you didn’t want Chang’e to descend. If it were me, I wouldn’t let her descend either!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…” Ye Zichen sighed helplessly. </span><i><span style>Yang Jian just doesn’t know how amazing the cosmetic technology is right now, nor does he know how advance the plastic surgery technology is.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>If these girls all came out plain and without make-up, then Yang Jian might not be so excited.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen took out a cigarette from his pocket and gave it to Yang Jian. Then, he heard his phone ring after lighting a cigarette from himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen took out his phone, causing Yang Jian to looked at Ye Zichen’s phone like a curious kid, “Bro, you use this to contact us? It seems far more advanced than our advance technology.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Yang Jian took out a straight long board from his pocket, which was similar to the phones in the Modern Realm multiple years ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Look!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen subconsciously received the phone. He noticed that their phone was not particularly heavy, as if they didn’t have any batteries.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That brought up a question he always held in his heart…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>How does the Heavenly Court generate electricity? How do they get internet!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows after returning the phone, “How do you charge the battery of your phone? Does the Heavenly Court have internet as well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Charge the battery?” Yang Jian said after a brief pause. “Are you talking about charging the phone up with energy? We all use celestial spiritual energy. Bro, do you not do that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Show me how you charge!” Ye Zichen handed his phone over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen’s hand immediately glowed without him saying anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, when he returned the originally fifty-percent charged phone, the battery was already full.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just like that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So advanced,” Ye Zichen was stunned. </span><i><span style>No wonder Han Xiangzi said that he could use the phone when I sent it over.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>So they don’t need to generate electricity. They are portable chargers themselves!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, don’t you charge it up like that?” Yang Jian was stunned. Then, he asked once again when he saw that Ye Zichen did not answer. “Then how do you guys communicate using your phones?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Our Heavenly Court has the celestial net… But, I seem to be unable to get its signal after getting here,” Yang Jian replied quietly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Ye Zichen was completely stunned.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Celestial net? Then the Underworld has the Underworld net? But how can my Mortal Net let me contact them?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is it seriously plot armor?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, his phone rang again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen knitted his eyebrows and opened the social media app. Recently, no one talked with him using personal chats.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, there was a small “1” on his contact list.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, how did you get on? I investigated it for an entire night, but still could not get on,” Yang Jian handed his over. The social media app continuously displayed that it was connecting, but he was unable to get into the main page.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes at him. </span><i><span style>This guy seriously talks too much. I’ve been listening to him for an entire day.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll tell you later.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After settling Yang Jian, Ye Zichen clicked to see his new friend request. When he saw it, he subconsciously looked at the Plantain Fan in his pocket and turned to Yang Jian, “Is Princess Iron Fan someone of the Heavenly Court?”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Original Chapter Teaser:</b>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p><b>Demon Sovereign A:&nbsp;</b>I think we need to retrieve the Fallen right away!</p>
 <p><strong>Demon Sovereign B:&nbsp;</strong>I adhere to that.</p>
 <p><strong>Demon Sovereign C:&nbsp;</strong>Likewise.</p>
 <p><strong>The Voice:&nbsp;</strong>What about you guys? Do you agree to that?</p>
 <p><strong>Demon Sovereign D:&nbsp;</strong>As per the words of the Demon Emperor, I think that it is only natural to bring him over to our side now. Even if we were to spend all our resources for the younger generation on him, it will be worth it. His blood dictates that he will not be common. Instead of waiting around to see him grow and let other factions pull him to their side, I think we should strike first, and bring him over to ours.</p>
 <p><strong>The Voice:&nbsp;</strong>Does anyone else have anything to add?</p>
 <p><strong>Demon Sovereign E:</strong>&nbsp;I think the rest of us are in agreement as well.</p>
 <p><strong>Demon Sovereign F:&nbsp;</strong>Rest of us? Maybe just you guys, but I disagree!</p>
