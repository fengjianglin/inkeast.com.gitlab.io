 <p><span style>Chapter 270 – Yue Lao’s Relationship Hall</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s heart jumped as he gripped his phone…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was in too much of a hurry just now, so he said the wrong thing. </span><i><span style>Ox-Head can’t have noticed something, right?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Those mortals are sick of living, right? They actually dared to offend Old Ox’s brother!” Ox-Head slapped in thigh in the alley of the streets, causing the group of nearby little ghosts to get freaked out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, your Ox Bro will help you teach the mortals you talked about a lesson.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ox Bro, didn’t you say that if anyone of us in the Underworld goes and harms people in the mortal realm, we will be thrown in the oil wok?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, little bro, you don’t know about it right? There are loopholes in everything,” Ox-Head explained with a smile like an older brother. “Tell Ox Bro, just which mortals offended little bro…?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen told Ox-Head about the location and appearances of the Ganshui Brothers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Leave it to I, Old Ox!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Ox-Head sent the message, he placed his phone back into his pocket, then casually grabbed two ghosts with foot cuffs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Marshal Ox!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both of these little ghosts were ones sent to Hell to be punished due to committing too many crimes in the Modern World. They were truly scared when they met ghosts servants of the Underworld, so they were naturally terrified when they saw Ghost Marshal Ox-Head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you want to get your foot cuffs taken off?” Ox-Head smiled slightly meaningfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, naturally!” The two ghosts quickly nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then do this…” Ox-Head grabbed the heads of the two ghosts and whispered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two ghosts quickly whispered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Inside the Ganshui Road farmhouse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The five brothers were truly not afraid of anything at all. Even though they were just beaten up, they were eating and drinking together happily once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qiang-zi, you’re still the most menacing!” The buzz cut knocked his beer jug with the scar-face. “It seems like we have to act more menacing from now on. Look at that rich second generation. He ran away with his tail between his legs!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Look… In terms of how menacing people are, we are this!” The scar-face raised his thumb, while the others also chuckled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The table was suddenly flipped over, while a sinister feeling surrounded them…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their sweat glands uncontrollably exploded, and that scar-face actually felt that something was touching his back…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The five people quickly kneeled on the floor and kowtowed towards the east, while muttering some inaudible words…</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen and co. finished their breakfast at the bun shop outside the school, then Ye Zichen directly returned to the dormitory, laid down on his bed and took out his phone…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He definitely wasn’t just going to do that. It was too low to just get several ghosts to scare them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since he was going to play, he had to play in a more high-class manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Yue Lao was looking at the messy red strings in the Marriage Hall with a frown. Ever since he started to do business in the Heavenly Court, he hadn’t dealt with the situation in the hall for a long time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao scratched his head with a terrible expression as he looked at the red strings in front of him, which would not be sorted out.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What am I supposed to do!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It was nearing the time for him to hand in the annual report, but he truly could not sort out the red strings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His phone on the table rang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao, who was getting troubled over the red strings, looked at the messages on it…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, what is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yue Lao, do you have some lower-leveled red strings? Send me a few!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Red string!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao felt like his head was going to explode whenever red strings were mentioned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Which fairy did Sky Sovereign fell for? Do you want to link the strings by yourself? That seems like it’s going to be rather troublesome, since this old man’s Marriage Hall is facing some small issues!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was speechless.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I had way more than enough red strings around me, and to link even more…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Do you think that I’m crazy!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, he did noticed Yue Lao’s words!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Marriage Hall!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Was the Marriage Hall that Yue Lao was talking about the place that was in charged of the marriages of the Three Realms? However, why did he say that there was trouble?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it? What trouble? Tell me and let me enjoy myself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao did not reply, but sent an image.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The image showed countless tangled red strings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately understood after seeing that.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>No wonder so many cheating incidents and stuff happened after marriage. So that’s the origin of the issue!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Man, you’re not good for doing that. These strings are all tangled together, so aren’t you forcing couples to fight?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This old man has no way to sort it out!” Yue Lao sighed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In my opinion, you should just cut all of these tangled strings. Let them start a new relationship. Otherwise, wouldn’t they just be harming each other?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How can that be okay!” Yue Lao said justly. “As Yue Lao, I have to be in charge of the relationships in the Three Realms. How can I intentionally destroy their marriages!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But aren’t you destroying them right now?” Ye Zichen was speechless. Those other men and other women had a more severe impact on the destruction of families.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Say, marriages have to be natural, so you should cut those tangled strings. If they truly are meant to be, then they will naturally go back together… That will stop the current situation which causes trouble for their families!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Scissors!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao lifted his hand. A celestial child immediately handed over a pair of scissors with a piece of red cloth tied on the handles.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Don’t blame me, blame Sky Sovereign Nameless. He told me to do this!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Snip.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao snipped the strings several times with his scissors, causing the tangled red strings to all fall apart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I cut them!’ Yue Lao placed the scissors back into the celestial child’s hand, then complained in a &nbsp;speechlessness inducing manner. “It seems like I’m not going to be able to get my year end bonus!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He’s still thinking about his year end bonus even now?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was truly speechless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What, even as Yue Lao, you got some performance indicators?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you think!?” Yue Lao rolled his eyes. “Right now, competition is huge in the Heavenly Court. Just those cuts…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Worried for what!?” Ye Zichen smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How could I not get worried. It’s nearly the end of the year!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can tell that you’re a newb at work,” Ye Zichen squinted his eyes. “This sovereign shall now tell you about the workplace survival laws…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After ten-odd minutes, Yue Lao was rather confused from all the listening. However, once he thought deeper into it, he found that the stuff Ye Zichen talked about really did make sense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, then how do you think I should fix it?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Yearend bonus was something that I definitely can’t lose!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Give me a few low-leveled red strings first. The ones that you can only use for ten odd or twenty days are fine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao sent the red packet without thinking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received Yue Lao’s red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Red String x5.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Red String: A necessary item to refine the Red Strings of Fate. It is able to have a simple string-tying effect, but it is not comparable to a Marriage String. It can only maintain itself for half a month.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not bad, not bad.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was exactly what Ye Zichen wanted…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>With these red strings, it seems like the Ganshui Road Brothers will love each other even more.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Yue Lao felt like he was on fire.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s going on with Sky Sovereign? Why does he disappear at the key moment every single time? He already told me about the workplace survival rules, but he didn’t say what I should do!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just how was I supposed to show myself off in front of the Jade Emperor? How can I get my year end bonus…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, Yue Lao wanted to sing a song…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Sky Sovereign, come back quick, I can’t take it by myself…</span></i></p>
