 <p><span style>Chapter 731 – Didn’t I Come In Anyways?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great deities.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Heavenly Soldiers standing guard were completely unsure of how they should address the various deities. There were too many important ones and if they were to greet them one by one, then the important deities might get unhappy about the sequence they were greeted in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So the best choice was to greet them as a group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With someone taking the lead, the other Heavenly Soldiers also respectfully greeted incomers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The deities nodded, then all walked out from the South heaven’s gate and greeted Ye Zichen familiarly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Heavenly Soldiers were dumbstruck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sky Sovereign.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>These are all famous important deities in the Heavenly Court, who was the one even they had to address as Sky Sovereign?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>They glanced over…</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was none other than Ye Zichen, whom they just refused entry.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Didn’t he get blacklisted by the Jade Emperor? Why are these important deities so friendly with him? Did they not get informed? It’s the blacklist! The Jade Emperor might punish them for this!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The Heavenly Soldiers thought to themselves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re all here! Zeze, even Comrade Old Lord came!” Ye Zichen shook his head with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang chuckled, “How can this old man not act as master of the house when Sky Sovereign has come?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The truth was that the two of them did get into a lot of conflicts initially.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Neither of them wanted to give in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it has already been a long time since then. Their revolutionary friendship allowed them to chat like familiar old friends.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You old geezer…” Ye Zichen chuckled, then dragged the Flame Emperor over. “This is Flame Emperor, one of the Immortal Region’s Primordial Five Emperors and a good friend of mine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hah, we’re all acquainted!” Yang Jian laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder and the others also nodded in agreement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They chatted quite a bit when the Three Realms had united against the demons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Enough talk, let’s stop crowding around here and invite Sky Sovereign in. Honestly, what the heck are we doing?” Yue Lao interrupted the greetings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian nodded, “Bro, c’mon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, Ye Zichen stepped towards the South Heaven’s Gate with the deities crowding around him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Heavenly Soldiers were extremely conflicted. </span><i><span style>He’s someone blacklisted by the Jade Emperor himself. We’re in so much trouble if we let him in.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But… The others aren’t people we should piss off either.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The Heavenly Soldiers remained silent and watched as Ye Zichen took a step through the South Heaven’s Gate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The guard captain could only walk out and stop everyone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm?” Yang Jian frowned. As the number one war god in the Heavenly Court, he was already the main general. Nobody in the army had dared to stop him before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The captain felt a chill down his spine. </span><i><span style>What am I doing!? I actually dared to stop True Lord Erlang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The other great deities also frowned. However, since neither Yue Lao and Old Lord Taishang were martial officials, the Heavenly Soldiers were not under their command, so they could only waited for the others to deal with the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you stopping me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Yang Jian spoke indifferently, the Heavenly Soldier was still under tremendous pressure just due to the presence of so many important people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“O’ True Lord, the Jade Emperor has ordered that this friend of yours is not permitted to enter the South Heaven’s Gate,” the Heavenly Soldier gritted his teeth and spurt out everything he wanted to say. After doing so, he felt a lot better.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Yeah! The Jade Emperor ordered this of us. We are merely obeying orders!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“The Jade Emperor said that my bro’s not allowed to enter? Don’t make things up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was the Chancellor of the Grand Secretariat, meaning that he was a favored one of the Jade Emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That put him merely below a single deity in the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>They are saying that the Jade Emperor decreed that my bro is not allowed to enter? Ridiculous!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Kid, you can do a lot of things, but you cannot speak so carelessly,” said Old Lord Taishang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign is the Chancellor of the Grand Secretariat in the Heavenly Court, how could he be denied entry?” Yue Lao agreed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zheng Qian, come over here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder waved his hand at the captain of the Heavenly Soldiers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Heavenly Soldier gulped, then did as God of Thunder said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder smacked his head, “You’ve got guts now don’t you? I only just promoted you the day before yesterday and you’re stopping Sky Sovereign now? You might as well get rid of your position. Lil’ Six, you’re the captain here from today onwards.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss….” The captain was concerned, after all, it was far more difficult to get promoted in the Heavenly Court compared to the Modern Realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone in the Heavenly Court lived almost forever, he had waited countless years to become a captain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So, do you know what you should do if you don’t want to lose your position?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let Sky Sovereign enter!” The captain of the Heavenly Soldiers gritted his teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The surrounding Heavenly Soldiers all moved aside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder nodded happily, “Alright, then you can keep being the captain.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, then what about me…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Lil’ Six mentioned before walked up to God of Thunder. </span><i><span style>I think I heard that I was captain while I was taking a dump?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But… That’s not the case now?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You? You can be the vice captain.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes sir!” Lil’ Six saluted in excitement. Vice Captain was an official job too. What’s more, that means that he managed to become a vice captain just after a hundred years in the Heavenly Court! That was massive when there are ones who have been normal Heavenly Soldiers for at least a thousand years.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He took a peek at Ye Zichen. </span><i><span style>It seems like me getting the job of a vice captain and nearly the captain was all thanks to this sire.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I must thank him properly in the future.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Lord, our brothers guarding the South Heaven’s Gate worked really hard, so do give them some pills that can improve their cultivation levels. As the first line of defense, the brothers guarding the South Heaven’s Gate have to be stronger,” Ye Zichen turned to Old Lord Taishang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang took out a clay vase without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This familiar scent…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Great Recovery Pills!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Can you be any more shameless?” Ye Zichen retorted. “You are actually offering crappy pills like this? Give them some good stuff.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang glared at Ye Zichen, then unwillingly took out a delicate jade vase.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Here, for you guys.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was obvious from OId Lord Taishang’s pained expression that the pills within were very valuable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you Old Lord. Thank you Sky Sovereign!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the Heavenly Soldiers quickly expressed their gratitude, Old Lord Taishang gritted his teeth and made up his mind that he must recoup these losses from Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Ye Zichen nodded with a smile, “Guard the South Heaven’s Gate well, don’t let other blacklisted people come in. Got it? On the side note, can I go in now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, please!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The South Heaven’s Gate’s Heavenly Soldiers already tossed the Jade Emperor’s orders behind them and been won over by Ye Zichen’s ‘caringness’ and ‘charisma’</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it wasn’t because they were mere Heavenly Soldiers, they really would start following Ye Zichen around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, then I’m going in,” Ye Zichen stepped into the Heavenly Court then turned to the deities around him. “Would it be possible for you all to come with me to the Cloudy Palace of the Golden Arches?”</span></p>

 <p>Things have been a lot busier in real life than I would have liked them to be, but regardless I’m sure you guys don’t care for the reasons. Either way, things are starting to settle down for me now, so I can indeed start posting properly again and play catch up like I intended to. I know it’s not much, but let’s start with 2 RPS chapters today.</p>
