 <p><span style>Chapter 628 – Cronyism</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Ye, where did you get such amazing stones from?” Zuo Liang’s eyes shone brightly as he looked towards Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen had no time for him. He was busy wondering whether he should take out his phone and what he should do if the Heavenly Sacred Emperor Equaling Heaven actually did send him a friend request.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Ye.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I picked them up from the side of the streets,” Ye Zichen replied in annoyance while wearing a frown. Then he sat down on a nearby chair and took out his phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gulp.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I’ll have to face this sooner or later…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He opened up the app.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s worrying heart finally calmed down when he saw that there were no friend requests. He let out a long sigh, but couldn’t help but feel a little bit disappointed.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>These stones can’t actually grant wishes. I suppose everything before that was just a coincidence.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As for the notification vibration, it was because the God of Thunder had just sent him a message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, I have some things I would like to request.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ugh, I haven’t even use any of my rights as the Chancellor of the Grand Secretariat, but I still have to deal with the things for the Jade Emperor now. Gah, I suppose I do have to work in this position.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Taibai Jinxing might have just been wiping the Jade Emperor’s ass all the time.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ahh, speaking of which, I haven’t contacted him for quite a while. I wonder what he’s been busy with. He hasn’t contacted me either.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, it’s like this. Over the past few years, the heavenly soldiers’ equipment have been damaged a bit, I would like to request some military funding to get some new equipment for the soldiers,” God of Thunder replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then do it. Oh yeah, you should go and ask the God of Fortune for money, why are you asking me?” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I should indeed go to the Gods of Fortunes, but you’re the chancellor, so I have to report it to you first to get your approval. Otherwise, I’ll only be ignored,” God of Thunder smiled wryly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, then just ask the God of Fortune directly and tell him that I told you so. You can even send those gods a screenshot of our chat. If they still don’t believe you, then tell them to come and find me.” Ye Zichen really couldn’t be bothered with all that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder chuckled as his intimacy level increased by 50 points, then went off to look for the God of Fortune.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Seriously, coming to me for these tiny matters.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen closed the chat and shook his head with a smile. However, before he could even put his phone away, God of Fortune had sent him a message.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck me, they’re seriously efficient!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was momentarily stunned, then he clicked open the chat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, you agreed to fund God of Thunder?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, what is the issue with it?” Ye Zichen replied. “The heavenly soldiers are important people who protect the land of our Heavenly Court, isn’t it normal to let them be better equipped? What’s more, aren’t you on pretty good terms with God of Thunder? Why do you need to come to me for this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>“Of course I’m willing to fund him, but the funding will take a lot of paperwork, it’s a lot of trouble,” God of Fortune sighed. “You know that we’re the five gods of fortune. Although I’m the God of Fortune proper, the power is split amongst all five of us. You heard of the martial and literi ones right? The Wenchang Monarch isn’t on good terms with me and I can’t be bothered with him…”<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s simple. You’re in charge of everything related to wealth from now on. Just show that Wenchang Monarch or something our chat. If he can’t accept it, then tell him to come to me. Oh yeah, don’t just fund the God of Thunder, even though he was the one who came to me, the other generals’ soldiers might need new equipment as well, so fund them all,” Ye Zichen waved his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, God of Fortune was beyond excited.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>After such a long cold war with Wenchang Monarch, it has finally come to an end.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I’ve finally got good backing!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood Sky Sovereign, I’ll go do that immediately. Come over to the Heavenly Court when you have time, I’ll set up a proper banquet for you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go, go,” Ye Zichen smiled. He understood that perhaps his method of handling everything was rather unfair to Wenchang Monarch, but the latter wasn’t someone he was familiar with, while Zhao Gongming was someone he was close and on good terms with. In fact, Zhao Gongming could be considered to be amongst one of those who he had first established a connection with.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their intimacy level reached 600, which was already in the admiration level. He wasn’t worried about Zhao Gongming betraying him at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, even if Zhao Gongming had the intention… He would be able to notice it with the system…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He can just directly fire God of Fortune any time he wants.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In less than thirty minutes, Ye Zichen received a friend request.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To no one’s surprise, it was one from Wenchang Emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Accept.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, when we, the status of the Gods of Fortune were bestowed upon the five of us, Taibai Jinxing intentionally split the powers between us five for balance. It was also to ensure that nobody would be able to single-mindedly dictate everything when trouble arises, which will make us discuss more. You just came to power, how could you hand all the power to Zhao Gongming?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenchang Emperor did not greet him, did not say anything else and instead said everything extremely bluntly!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wow, very strong.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But I’m not afraid.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You got a problem with that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course. You’re messing around here!” Wenchang Monarch said fiercely. “Do you want to destroy the balance that Taibai Jinxing tried to keep? What’s more, I hear that you’re very close with Zhao Gongming. Immediately promoting those around you after taking to the office… Isn’t this just cronyism!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hahaha…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>As expected of the Literari God of Fortune, he truly phrased everything in a sophisticated manner.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But… so what?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>‘Lil’ Wen, you have to obey the will of the office. Taibai Jinxing is a senior who this sovereign respects, but he has already left the Heavenly Court. The Heavenly Court is in a huge mess recently. The Jade Emperor handed me this power out of his trust for me. I have my own ideas when handling things, so saying that it’s cronyism is too much!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, this sovereign has a lot more stuff to handle. Zhao Gongming will be in charge of the policies related to finance from now on. Work hard for him. Ta ta.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen deleted Wenchang Monarch from his friend list.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Cronyism. Yeah, he’s right. That’s what I’m doing.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>So what?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>He can only endure it!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s more, he’s not the only one who was stripped of power, yet he’s the only one who came to complain? Who does he think he is?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenchang Monarch’s intimacy level decreased by 100. Current intimacy level: 0.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your intimacy level with Wenchang Monarch has leveled down. Current intimacy level: Cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Decreased intimacy level? What’s he trying to do? Scare me?” Ye Zichen chuckled, then sent a message to Zhao Gongming. “Zhao Gongming, that Wenchang Monarch was disrespectful towards me just now. Strip him of his position as the Literari God of Fortune and tell him to go home. We’ll decide what to do with him based on his future performance. If he wishes to ask for forgiveness, then we’ll get him a job in the future, if he doesn’t, then let him just retire like this. Also, find someone to fill in the empty position yourself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen turned to the group chat and sent out a notice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notice: Due to Wenchang Monarch refusing to comply with the organization’s decisions and speaking very disrespectfully towards his superior, it has been announced that he shall be stripped of the position as the Literari God of Fortune. Due to his work for the Heavenly Court, he is allowed to keep his celestial position. This is effective immediately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wenchang Monarch kicked the golden toad in front of him to the ground the moment he saw the message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is pissing me off!”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Original Chapter Teaser:</strong>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>I can't believe this! It actually came true! I'll just accept it now and...</p>
 <p>Oh.</p>
 <p>Never mind.</p>
 <p>It wasn't the&nbsp;<span style>Great Sacred Emperor Equaling Heavens. I should've expected this outcome, i-I was just too hopeful. If it really could grant wishes, then&nbsp;everything could have stopped right now. I could have wished for Xiao Yumei to come back to me, I could have wished for those demon scums to all be killed. I could have wished for the Modern Realm to be unfrozen.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p>Ahhh.</p>
 <p>I suppose it makes sense</p>
 <p>After all, how could such a cheat be given to me? If I have access to such a cheat, then that guy would've had access to it to, so there was no way he would be here.</p>
 <p>Sigh... Everything that happened before was merely a coincidence. There is no doubt about it.</p>
