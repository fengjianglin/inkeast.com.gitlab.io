 <p><span style>Chapter 322 – Taibai Jinxing Who Gets Angry at the Mention of Kids</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing’s eyebrows knitted closely together. He was certain that his spokesperson in the mortal realm was definitely a normal person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, there was only one possibility for him to be able to pry into the Laws of the World…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He was the reincarnation of a heavyweight.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen squinted his eyes. </span><i><span style>Just what’s going on with Geezer Taibai?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>He said that I’m the reincarnation of a heavyweight?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could this old guy know that I’m the reincarnation of the Yellow Emperor? But from his tone, he doesn’t seem too sure. That’s why he’s asking.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Geezer, stop trying to scare me. If I really am the reincarnation of a heavyweight, then would I be trying to be a grandson in front of you? Wouldn’t I just directly smack you dead?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I can’t tell this geezer about me being a reincarnation of the Yellow Emperor. Great Emperor Qingming told me that the relationship between the Three Realms are very tense right now.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I really can’t do anything if I told him carelessly, and this old guy decided to cause trouble for me.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Although Ye Zichen did not know how strong the geezer was, since the geezer was the head butler of the Heavenly Court, he would at least have to be someone of the Sky Immortal level. </span><i><span style>If he was hitting me, then he could smack me to death with just one slap.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“No? Impossible!” Taibai Jinxing was extremely stubborn, so he insisted on his belief that Ye Zichen was the reincarnation of a heavyweight.</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>Just like Xuanzang was the reincarnation of Golden Cicada<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> of the Buddhists…</span></span></p>
 <p><i><span style>All of Xuanzang’s disciples were fierce people that have now become Sky Immortal experts, while Golden Cicada also became a Sky Immortal expert when he regained his Buddhahood.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But, I haven’t heard of anyone in the Heavenly Court deciding to go through reincarnation recently!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Then he’s clearly from the other two realms…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I really am not. Geezer, how can I make you believe what I say!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen also displayed a helpless expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, Taibai Jinxing was not that confident in his judgement. </span><i><span style>If Ye Zichen was truly the reincarnation of a heavyweight…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Then someone form the other two realms would definitely protect him properly. However…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You say that you’re not, then how are you able to transmit your voice to me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I just sent you a voice message. If you don’t believe me…” Ye Zichen muttered, then sent a screenshot of the voice message in the chat. “Look, I merely sent you a voice message. God knows what’s going on at your side. I’m in the mortal realm, I can’t see what’s going on in the Heavenly Court.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>What Ye Zichen was doing was to pretend that he was truly wronged. He had to make himself seem extremely low, while he stared closely at what Taibai Jinxing was doing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the old brat saw his screenshot, a sign of relief appeared on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, he smiled faintly and replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmph, even so, you cannot prove that you’re not the reincarnation of a heavyweight. This old man can help you keep the secret, but only if you help me deal with my problem at no cost!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This old guy!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It was clear that Taibai Jinxing no longer suspected Ye Zichen of being the reincarnation of a heavyweight, but he still chose to reply as if he didn’t believe Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He thought that Ye Zichen did not know what was going on. Yet, what he did not know was that Ye Zichen saw everything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, that was not something that Ye Zichen could say…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Since I finally calmed the geezer down, if I tell him that I can see what’s going on at his place, the matter would only indefinitely continue.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Say it, what problem do you want me to help you deal with?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck, it truly pains me to be in a losing position.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s the problem with the Heavenly Court’s school. The school is established, but the kids just play all day. I got plenty of cultivation secret scriptures from the deities, but the students aren’t studying! Plenty of deities said that their children only became more wild after going to school, so they want to let their kids quit!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing frowned. </span><i><span style>If these deities decided to suspend their kids’ studies, then I’ll have to refund them quite a bit.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I don’t want to spit out the money that’s already in my hands.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you still need to ask me for such a simple problem? Ye Zichen rolled his eyes in annoyance. “Aren’t exams going to solve everything?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Exams?” Taibai Jinxing did not understand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your geezer brain really doesn’t know how to think logically,” Ye Zichen sighed softly. “All of you employees of the Heavenly Court have a year end examination, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since the staff will get tested, can’t you do the same to the students?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows. “Just make an examination system for the students. Implement monthly exams, mid-term exams and term exams. If they fail, then tell their parents. I think these kids should be terrified of you doing that, right? Also, if they fail, then make them retake the exam. Make them pay for the retake fees every single time. If they have to retake twice, then make them repeat the year. Doesn’t that solve it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s that simple?” Taibai Jinxing was stunned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How hard can it be? Geezer, I don’t think you have any descendants, right? If you have kids, then you might be able to understand their thoughts more,” Ye Zichen smiled. What he did not know was that his words completely prodded Taibai Jinxing where it hurts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck off!” Taibai Jinxing cursed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re cursing me?” Ye Zichen did not know about Taibai Jinxing’s background, so he raised his eyebrows. “Since you cursed me, I’m not going to help you anymore!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck off, this old man told you to f*ck off!” Taibai Jinxing glared. “if you don’t, then this old man is descending to the mortal realm!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“… Fine, fine, fine. I’ll f*ck off!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Seriously, why did this geezer get angry so quickly?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>After exiting the chat, Ye Zichen stared at the image and frowned.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Maybe this geezer was just pretending to be angry and didn’t walk to talk about the price. </span></i><span style>However, what he did not expect was that when Taibai Jinxing stopped talking, he actually threw the phone to the side and started to silently wipe away tears from his eyes with a sigh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It can’t be. Did I say something wrong?” Ye Zichen squinted his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Erlang Shen sought Ye Zichen out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, thank you for last time. Otherwise, I really would have been crippled by the monkey.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Erlang Shen was rich now, he was able to spend money to get it treated. He didn’t have to be like before, where he would have to hid at home every time he gets hurt and just use his celestial spiritual energy to heal himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was originally able to beat the monkey, but it was because he always had to use his celestial spiritual energy to heal, it caused his cultivation level to drop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No worries, we’re brothers!” Ye Zichen smiled faintly. Then he glanced at the weeping Taibai Jinxing and asked Erlang Shen. “Bro, I’ve got something to ask you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ask away!” Erlang Shen replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Does Taibai Jinxing have some hidden secret? When I was talking to him just now, he suddenly got angry at me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>“Angry? No way. Geezer Taibai always have a smiling face on like Maitreya<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>, how could he get angry?” Erlang Shen frowned. However, then he immediately added. “You can’t have talked about children or wife with him, right!?”</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s wrong with that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was stunned. He did mention that, but it was merely chitchat. He only intended to tease the geezer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It can’t be. Bro, you really said it!?” Erlang Shen was completely shocked. “The fact that you’re still alive makes you so very lucky!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I should’ve have talked about it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, you shouldn’t talk about it to him!” Erlang Shen replied resolutely. “It is a forbidden topic for Taibai Jinxing!”</span></p>
