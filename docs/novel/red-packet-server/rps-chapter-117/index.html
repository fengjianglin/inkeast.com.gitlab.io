 <p><span style>Chapter 117 – The Legal Wife has spoken</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was truly excited in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wished for so long and finally got good news.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m here, go and make a chat group and drag the customer and I in.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What for? Isn’t it good to speak here directly?” Third Prince Nezha answered cutely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is the spokesperson group, we’re enough. Create a group and drag the customer in. Then, he’ll be your client, then I’ll be able to give you your commission.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Commission? I don’t get it! But since great deity said that, then let’s do just that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, Third Prince Nezha created a chat group. Aside from him and Ye Zichen, there was also a God of Food, who was wearing a kitchen hat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha: @Only Idealism @God of Food</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Food: The little deity is here &lt;insert a row of cute emojis&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seems like the God of Food did position himself rather lowly. However, that seemed to be right, the God of Food didn’t have a high position in the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha: Great deity, it’s the God of Food that wants to purchase from you.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you want to buy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>From Ye Zichen’s prediction, this God of Food shouldn’t have come to purchase snacks. There was a ninety percent chance that he wanted to buy other stuff.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great deity, this little deity wants to buy some condiments.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It really was as he expected.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sighed. Since he wanted to buy condiments, then the prices won’t be so high, and most importantly, it would be able to be used for quite a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen would be at a disadvantage if he asked for cultivation experience.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, this sovereign doesn’t need you to pay cultivation experience to sell condiments to you. This sovereign recently got interested in cookery.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Cookery?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The God of Food was stunned for a while in a certain manor on the Third Heaven of the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had never heard of any great deity being interested in cookery after getting to the Heavenly Court for so long.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They say that this Sky Sovereign Nameless is a great deity that lived with great deity Taibai Jingxing, he actually said that he likes cookery…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This little deity is willing to send this little deity’s cookery experiences to great deity.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>So direct.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen thought that this God of Cookery would have to hesitate for a bit, he didn’t think that he would send it that willingly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, then send your cooking experiences to this sovereign. This sovereign doesn’t have the condiments around, so it has to be sent later.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A red packet on the screen. Ye Zichen clicked on it…</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received the God of Food’s red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Food’s Cookery Experiences x1</span></p>
 <p><span style>This God of Food was truly generous, others only sent secret scriptures a volume by a time, this guy sent the entire set.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Got it, wait for me to send it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, great deity. This little deity will take his leave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, the God of Food disappeared from the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person that messaged him was Third Prince Nezha.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great deity, this count as me successfully bringing a customer, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what do I get?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Commercialization was truly poisonous to these deities, even this moe shota Nezha actually started to ask for benefits.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It hurts!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen wasn’t a stingy person either. It was through Nezha’s aid that he got the God of Food’s cookery scripture.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen thought about it…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll give you a thousand cultivation experience of budget with me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, doesn’t that mean I can buy tons of snacks?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I want 10 bottles of Nutri-Express and six bags of chips.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, but you have to wait a bit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your intimacy level with Nezha increased by 30. Current intimacy level: 230.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha seemed to have gotten much more motivated after seeing the benefits. When Ye Zichen clicked on his moments, he saw that little shota start to send pictures in on his Moments.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seems like a bunch of WeChat merchants will appear in the Celestial Realm in the future…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noon the next day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Riche Bro.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stood mulberry grove outside the school when a loud commotion sounded out. He looked up, then saw Xia Keke and Su Yan walk shoulder to shoulder towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>More importantly, the gazes that the surrounding students had towards Ye Zichen seemed weird.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The unwritten rule of the school’s mulberry grove said that all of the boys and girls that came here together were couples.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The fact that they chose this place as the meeting point, were they going to announce their relationship?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Riche Bro, did you wait long? Susu and I bought a cold drink for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke handed Ye Zichen a cup of coke. At that moment, he noticed that both of them held a cup of coke in their hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the surrounding commotion got louder and louder, Ye Zichen received the coke and scratched his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did you choose to meet here, this is…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? Is there anything wrong with it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan frowned and looked at the surrounding students.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The next moment, Su Yan and Xia Keke grabbed one of Ye Zichen’s arm each under the gazes of all the students.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wow.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The surrounding students exploded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen also gulped and smiled dryly, “You guys…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We did it on purpose, is it not okay?” Su Yan raised her delicate chin. Meanwhile, Xia Keke also nodded on the side, “Susu and I did it on purpose.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, you two….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was truly a bit confused!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>We did it on purpose!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Could they planned it together? Doesn’t that mean, Su Yan…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I chatted with Keke a few days ago,” Su Yan smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm, for a long time,” Xia Keke also nodded on the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then the end…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gulp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen gulped, it seems like…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We decided to let you get lucky.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan replied with squinted eyes. Ye Zichen’s body trembled, while his expression tensed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you really happy? Two school beauties liking you at the same time and admitting each other’s existence. Don’t you feel great?” Xia Keke also raised her head and snorted playfully. “But don’t get too full of yourself. Susu and I are allies, we oppose all outsiders.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That being said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke was really right. Ye Zichen truly felt…</span></p>
 <p><span style>A-MA-ZING!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two school beauties in Polytechnic University liking him at the same time and be together with him together…</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was definitely something that anyone could brag about for a life time.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>But!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the hell was this “opposing all outsiders”.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>That means that they won’t let anyone else in, then what about Xiao Yumei and Huang Shengmei!</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were four people he had a marriage string with!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sneaked a glance at Su Yan and Xia Keke, then asked in a testing manner, “If there are others…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you say?” Su Yan directly caught on before he finished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Xia Keke was a bit calmer. She did come later, so she didn’t have too much issue with it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Ziche, I’m telling you, if you dare to have other women outside…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen gulped and his body tensed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If it’s more than 5, then just wait for death.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blink.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shock</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, Su Yan, what did you just say? Was I hearing things” Ye Zichen turned his head and looked at Su Yan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He saw Su Yan glare fiercely at him before snorting, “I said, if you have more than five women outside, then wait for death.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If it’s not over?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then-Then I can accept it, at least we can have a day each!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan suddenly replied shyly with a pout.</span></p>
