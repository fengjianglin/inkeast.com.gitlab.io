 <p><span style>Chapter 412 – Gift</span></p>
 <p><span style>Faint disdain flashed across Gu Li’s eyes when he heard that roar. He picked his ear, then raised his eyebrows at Ye Zichen, who was trembling in anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You aren’t the boss just because you’re loud. Who are you trying to scare?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is it fun?” Ye Zichen squinted his eyes at Gu Li, who was smiling playfully. “If you aren’t happy with me, then come at me… You, aren’t you afraid of karma?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Karma?” Gu Li smiled faintly. He stretched lazily and squinted his eyes. “What’s karma? You’re talking about karma with me? Don’t you find it funny? Stop being so childish, okay? Karma… Hahahaha, Karma is merely a psychological thing that the weak use to curse the strong. I don’t think that you need to say this sort of thing. I did treat you as a rival. How is it? Are you happy with this present I gave you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Creak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clenched his fists even tighter, and stared straight at Gu Li with a shake of his head, “You’re helpless.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hahaha, your words are hilarious,” Gu LI squinted his eyes, then walked towards Ye Zichen. He placed his right hand on Ye Zichen’s shoulder and smile. “Don’t you want to make everybody happy? Then I, will make everybody not live in happiness… I’ve already moved, so now, shouldn’t you… make yours?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck you!” Ye Zichen punched Gu Li and grabbed him by his collar, threw him onto the ground then continuously beat him…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zeze, you’re too inhumane. That’s your roommate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked down, and saw that the person he held was Zhu Yunbai, who had only just died, while Gu Li was still standing exactly where he stood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen curled his lips, then stood up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked at Gu Li, who was looking on with interest, while his gaze gradually turned cold. “Stop using these petty tricks here, there’s no need for that. Don’t you want to deal with me? I’m standing right in front of you. You have the advantage in numbers as well… Come, I’m waiting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoosh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A pair of black wings sprouted form Ye Zichen’s back as he stared coldly in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s true,” Gu Li nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoosh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A pair of gray wings suddenly sprout from Gu Li’s back as well. Ye Zichen’s eyes twitched when he saw the wings, while Gu Li chuckled, “Don’t think that you’re the only one with them. I’m so sorry, but I have them too!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Li smiled indifferently, while Ye Zichen responded with a smile, then flapped his wings, and flew towards Gu Li.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang bang bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two of them exchanged blows extremely quickly, so quickly that others were only able to hear the sound of their blows without seeing their actions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zeze, not bad!” Gu Li maintained a faint smile from the very beginning, as if he didn’t take Ye Zichen seriously at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, ice edge…” Ye Zichen merely responded Gu Li’s mockery with a cold smile. He reached towards the ground, and willed the ice edge he threw onto the ground into his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zeze, using a weapon now?” Gu Li mocked. However, he did not act carelessly at all. He could feel the sharpness of the ice edge, and if that touched him…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Then I might be cut in half.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Scatter!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the two of them neared each other, Ye Zichen suddenly roared out, causing a barrage of ice crystals to appear forth from the ice edge in his hands and fly towards Gu Li.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not good!” Gu Li felt a chill down his spine, then dashed towards the ground, while he grabbed towards the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Jing, who was looking up at the situation in the sky, felt her body flew up uncontrollably, and block in front of Gu Li.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong dong dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the ice crystals stabbed into Guo Jing’s body. Blood continuously flowed from her body, as Gu Li flung her body towards Ye Zichen…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Here’s another present. Catch.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Jing crashed into Ye Zichen’s body as Gu Li wanted her to. Ye Zichen subconsciously catch her, but when he saw her face…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yao Yue!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen… Ahem,” blood flowed endlessly out of Yao Yue’s mouth. She wanted to raise her hand, but her body no long allowed herself to do so. She could only look at Ye Zichen with an apologetic gaze. “Actually, I’ve always wanted to say to you… Sorry, I was wrong.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why is it you, Guo Jing…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry, sorry!” Yao Yue kept on uttering the same sentence. All of a sudden, Ye Zichen suddenly thought of a certain possibility, causing him to freeze…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>An opening!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Li squinted his eyes with a smile, the flew over in the raging winds, and punched straight through Ye Zichen’s chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen coughed up a mouthful of golden blood. He turned his head back and saw Gu Li standing behind him with a look that said “the ploy worked”…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How is it? You’re very satisfied with the present, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ugh…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blood begun to uncontrollably flow from his mouth. Then, his limp body also began to fall towards the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The intense collision between his body and the ground caused him to cough up another mouthful of blood. At the same time, Gu Li also descended from the sky and slowly walk towards Ye Zichen like a victor. “You really should feel guilty. If it wasn’t for you… These people wouldn’t have gotten involved. They might still be enjoying their amazing university life. But, it’s all on you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Ye Zichen no longer had anymore energy to retort. He could feel his life slowly drain away as death approached closer and closer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Li squinted his eyes and snorted as if he really enjoyed the situation. “If it wasn’t for your self-righteous action of helping Gu Tian get the junior family head position, if it wasn’t for your self-righteous action of destroying all my plans, if it wasn’t for you… Then I don’t have to be so close with the demons at all. I also wouldn’t have done all of this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s all on you. If you didn’t appear, then this world wouldn’t have gone this way. But because of your appearance, you destroyed my dream, so I will become your nightmare for your entire lifetime. Hahahaha… This is only the beginning. In the future, everyone around you will becomes abyssals, and all your women will become my playthings.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But, it is a pity that it seems like you won’t be able to see all that, because… You are going to die… Hahahaha!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Li laughed recklessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Ye Zichen’s heart could only be filled with blatant rage that he had no way of displaying…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Angry? Hehehehe… So pitiful. Sorry, I won this time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Li raised his foot and was about to step down onto Ye Zichen’s head, but at that very moment, a meatball-like fatty suddenly appeared behind him and knocked him several tens of meters away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck, I nearly failed to stop!”</span></p>
 <p></p>

 <p><i>In the next chapter of Red Packet Server...</i></p>
 <p>The mastermind behind the huge army of abyssals has finally appeared! Having surprised Ye Zichen twice already with his appearance, and a huge 'gift', what is next?</p>
 <p>Just what tricks and ploys does he have up his sleeve? How will Ye Zichen over come it? Will it be through his wit, his strength? Or will it be through external help? Or perhaps a sudden change of heart from the enemy?</p>
