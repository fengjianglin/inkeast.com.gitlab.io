 <p><span style>Chapter 62 – White Impermanence wants to add his WeChat</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen did not immediately go and message Old Lord Taishang after reciving the news of their intimacy level rising.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Being in such a hurry would not end up in business. Ye Zichen was sure that Old Lord Taishang would take the initiative in contacting him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as he had expected. The other side sent him a message only several tens of seconds later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang: Fellow Daoist, I chatted with Yue Lao for a bit just now. You didn’t get anxious from waiting, right?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>See? His attitude completely changed.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Not too much. I was merely wondering about Old Lord Taishang’s Nine Reincarnation Soul Pill…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang: The pill is definitely there, it’s just that…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Old Lord, just say whatever you want to say directly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang: I heard that fellow daoist gave Yue Lao a box of Yuxi.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Old people like these were truly more interested in stuff like cigarettes.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: This little deity can use cigarettes to exchange a pill from Old Lord.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang: Okay, but I want five boxes.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Five boxes!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That geezer sure was black-hearted enough. Ye Zichen had merely given Yue Lao two boxes of Yuxi in total.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it’s alright. Ye Zichen wasn’t afraid of him being greedy, he was afraid of him not wanting anything for Ye Zichen to trade.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A business transaction could be made when there were needs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Alright.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang: Send it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Wait a moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen let out a long sigh, then put his phone into his pocket before walking to the Black Impermanence’s side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was definitely a dangerous person in Black Impermanence’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he saw Ye Zichen walk over, he instantly cried once more, “Big bro, what do you want with me now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen reached out his hand to grab Black Impermanence’s arms and snorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have to go out shortly. I’m not fine with you staying here, so you’re coming with me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Su family and a lot of experts from the hospital were waiting outside the operation room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Ye Zichen really could save Elder Su, then it would be a miracle in the history of medicine.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although nobody thought that Ye Zichen could actually succeed, they did hope that they would hear good news.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The door to the operation room opened. Ye Zichen was holding something in front of him with his right hand and walked out from the operation room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi, how is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun was the first to rush over. Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows and looked at everyone, “I need five boxes of cigarettes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll go and buy them immediately.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll also need a juicer and a small cup.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll buy everything for you in one go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Su Yiyun ran outside from the operation room. Ye Zichen sat down on a chair to rest his eyes while maintaining the grabbing action with his right hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brat, what sort of tricks are you trying to pull!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Qihu walked over with a glare. Ye Zichen opened his eyes and raised his eyebrows, “Don’t care about what sort of tricks I pull, isn’t it fine as long as I can save him?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Save him.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could the things just now be used for saving Elder Su?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>All of the doctors were shocked. They had never heard of how saving people required cigarettes and juicers after many years of being a doctor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A light flashed across Deng Cheng’s eye as he asked with suspicion, “Little fellow, are you sure that you’re not kidding?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had a decent impression of Deng Cheng, because Deng Cheng did not have the usual prideful airs of people in high positions, and because Deng Cheng was very friendly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded towards him and smiled, “Of course I’m not kidding. It’s just that my method of treatment is different from yours.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Deng Cheng stopped asking questions. Meanwhile, Su Yan stood at a close distance looking at Ye Zichen, while biting her lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was very hard for her to describe her feelings towards Ye Zichen at that moment.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Thanks, admiration…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>She wasn’t sure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Merely half an hour later, Su Yiyun hurried back with a carton of Zhonghua and a juicer over,</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun looked at Ye Zichen in anticipation after he handed over what Ye Zichen needed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen laughed softly, “I can definitely save the old man.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The door to the operation room closed once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen casually threw Black Impermanence to the corner and opened the row of cigarettes. He scanned it and directly sent it to Old Lord Taishang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang received your red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received Old Lord Taishang’s red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nine Reincarnation Soul Pill x1</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang was a honespt person, so he directly sent the pill over after receiving Ye Zichen’s red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Thank you, Old Lord Taishang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang: There is no need for thanks, it’s just business.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang was clearly very rational.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen took a look at the intimacy level that didn’t change. It seems like it wasn’t going to be that simple to increase his intimacy level with Old Lord Taishang.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>As expected of the Three Pure Ones!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, that didn’t matter, what mattered was that he had the pill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen opened his WeChat Treasure Chest and withdrew the Peach of Immortality as well as the Nine Reincarnation Soul Pill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A huge peach the size of seven or eight normal peaches instantly appeared in Ye Zichen’s hand, alongside a black pill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Ye, this…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Su was a bit stunned. On the other hand, Liu Qing was no longer surprised, but the first time she saw this, her reaction as about the same as Elder Su’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Elder Su, this is my secret. I hope you won’t tell other people.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had a serious look in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Su nodded understandingly, “This old man knows what should be said, and what shouldn’t be.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stopped worrying after hearing Elder Su’s steadfast reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then let’s start returning the soul to the body.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen placed the Nine Reincarnation Soul Pill into Elder Su’s mouth in order to call his soul back, then squeezed out the juices of the Peach of Immortality for Elder Su.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ten-odd minutes later…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pushed open the door of the operation room and walked out tiredly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He arrived in front of Su Qihu under everyone’s gaze and stared straight into Su Qihu’s eyes, “Don’t forget our promise.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everybody outside the operation room rushed into it. Only Su Yan stood in the doorway as her tears flowed uncontrollably.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, thank you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen left the hospital, it was already early in the morning. There were very few cars on the streets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen walked on the streets alone as the road lights extended his shadow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, that guy seems to be following us the entire time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing, who was beside him, twitched her mouth. Ye Zichen turned around and saw White Impermanence following him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is something the matter?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stopped and watched White Impermanence swishing her sleeves around, trying to express something that he could not comprehend.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just say whatever it is.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen felt that White Impermanence was rather pitiful. She had a husband that would flirt around outside, but she didn’t dare to say anything about it. What’s more, she even had to endure domestic violence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t know whether the Underworld had marriage laws, but if the couple were here, a simple piece of paper would allow her to sue Black Impermanence in the court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>White Impermanence hesitated for a long time, then slowly walked towards Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uhmm, can I add you on WeChat?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, a phone appeared in White Impermanence’s hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen subconsciously took a glance at it.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>A knockoff.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled after seeing this.</span><i><span style> So the Heavenly Court and the Underworld also used phones.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, a new business opportunity surfaced in Ye Zichen’s mind.</span></p>
