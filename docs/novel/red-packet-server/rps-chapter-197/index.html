 <p><span style>A gust of wind blew by.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s clothes fluttered in the air as he looked up at White Impermanence in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You didn’t find her?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm, Sikong Spiritual Compass did not show any traces of the ghost girl by your side,” White Impermanence nodded. Then she pointed at the little ghosts who were on the side. “We can only use Plan B.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do they have any secret techniques to find ghosts?” Ye Zichen’s eyes lit up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>White Impermanence smiled wordlessly, “How is that possible? Even we ghost servants don’t know any, how could they know? I guessed that the spiritual compass wouldn’t be able to find her, so I got a bunch of helpers to come. The more ghosts, the more capable we are!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then alright!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen and White Impermanence separated from the other ghosts after describing Liu Qing’s appearance to them.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Finding a ghost was more troublesome than finding a person.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>When one sought out a person, it was possible to use the powers of certain related departments, but finding ghosts…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It seems like I am using the power of related departments.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>From the looks of it, these departments are always going to be our dearest friends!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Ye, I found something over there…” As Ye Zichen wandered around aimlessly, a bony little ghost floated down from the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where… Take me over quickly!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In the garden, over there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen followed that little ghost to a garden nearby approximately ten minutes away, this garden was clearly not open to the public…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How are we supposed to get in!?” Ye Zichen asked idiotically.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little ghost also answered idiotically, “Fly in!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He flew in!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You two…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen turned around and looked at Third Hou and Fourth Hou…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The two of them f*cking flew in too.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen went dumb.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Am I supposed to fly in as well?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Being ghosts and deities are great, they can fly whenever they want to.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>They all have invisible wings!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen scratched his head with a look of envy, then looked at the height of the fence…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Climb over.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Fortunately, the property owner didn’t have an extremely strong sense of security, and didn’t put anything like an electric net on it, otherwise, Ye Zichen would really be unable to enter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen landed safely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He took a glance at the flowers in the garden. It seems like the owner of the garden was interested in lilac…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The entire garden was full of lilac!</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the little ghost had disappeared, and Ye Zichen couldn’t find his two monkey bodyguards either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, someone patted Ye Zichen’s shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not a ghost?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A spooky voice sounded out, causing Ye Zichen to turned his head in confusion. He saw a young man with a pale face like a deceased person standing behind him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen quickly brushed the brat’s hand off, then backed off a suitable distance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you human or a ghost!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you human or a ghost?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man opposite him also scratched his head in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you think I’m a human or a ghost!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you think I’m a human or a ghost?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you think I’m a human or a ghost!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you think I’m a human or a ghost?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Am I talking to a mirror!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was goddamn speechless, why did the brat keep on copying what he said with the same tone…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Am I talking to a mirror?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, the young man also tilted his head. At the same time, a call sounded out in the garden, “Bu Er, what are you doing? Did you catch the ghost?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, a young man wearing traditional Chinese clothing walked out from a corner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know whether he’s a human or a ghost!” The young man with a stark white face tilted his head and pointed at Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not sure?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man in traditional Chinese clothes walked over with two cages in his hand. These two cages held a shrunken version of Liu Qing, and the little ghost that just entered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were also two white-robed men behind him who were controlling Third Hou and Fourth Hou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Ye.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Liu Qing! Monkey…” Ye Zichen exclaimed and looked at Liu Qing, who had a pitiful expression as she stayed in the cage as if she was a pet for someone; as well as Third and Fourth Hou, whose faces had struggling expressions…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He raised his hand and grabbed at the young man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you doing, you can’t do anything to Young Master Xie!” The young man with a stark white face suddenly reached out his hand and grabbed Ye Zichen’s wrist…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ooooh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen instantly took a deep breath.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So icy!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>That sort of coldness nearly froze his blood, causing him to subconsciously want to retract his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh? He’s a living person.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man quickly retracted his hand and took a few steps back timidly, “Go away living person, I don’t like living people!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Don’t like living people.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Was this child a dead person? But why did he have a solid body….</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Bu Er, get behind me,” the young man in traditional Chinese clothing called to the other young man behind him, then handed the cages to him. After that, he took a few steps forward with a frown, “Which… family are you from? Do you not know that this is a place belonging to us, the Xie family? You actually dared to trespass, do you want to break the rules?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xie family? I don’t care what family you belong to! I just want to know why did you put the two of them into cages. Also, those two are my friends, why did you detain them!” Ye Zichen frowned at the young man in traditional Chinese clothing who stood in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That young man laughed softly and shrugged, “That’s my interest. Whenever I meet ghosts that can’t find their home, I like to rear them, then hand them over to the Underworld after I get sick of them… As for the other two, people of the Heavenly Court who got lost. I don’t welcome them!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…” Ye Zichen clenched his fist tightly, this young man clearly treated them as playthings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter what, ghosts should have ghost rights, too.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This young man immediately imprisoned them from the start, then just spoke casually as if that justified everything he had done…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Also, this brat said that the monkeys were people of the Heavenly Court. </span></i><span style>Ye Zichen didn’t like that!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let my friends go, then we’ll pretend like nothing happened,” Ye Zichen immediately became furious. He really couldn’t accept this kind of people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man in traditional Chinese clothing scratched his face with a smile after hearing that, “Can I interpret your tone as you threatening me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Six white-robed men with blurry faces suddenly appeared. They walked out of the shadows of the garden.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen swept his gaze over them…</span></p>
 <p><span style>These people were all like that Bu Er, they all lacked the aura of a living being.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>But they had a physical body!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, Ye Zichen felt a hint of danger coming from their bodies!</span></p>
 <p><span style>More importantly, they had a lot of people, and he was all alone…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, this chivalrous hero, I didn’t have any intention of threatening you! Say, just what do you mean by calling such a huge group of people over? You seem so unfriendly!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When faced with this kind of this situation, to be honest, Ye Zichen…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Felt a bit diffident.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was especially true because he didn’t know why did Soul Pearl Yiyuan still had not appeared. Without it protecting him…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was afraid!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My friends broke into your back garden by mistake. Let me apologize to you in their place. Please be merciful then let us go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man fell into deep thought after hearing Ye Zichen’s words…</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a long while, he glared at Ye Zichen with his innocent eyes, “Why should I?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, he pointed at the two apes in Bu Er’s hands, “If you want to take them away, sure. Let’s exchange!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen didn’t reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We, the Xie family, have always been just. These two children ran into my back garden, and since they got caught, they are now my products. If you want to take them back, sure… Equivalent exchange!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you want!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man in traditional Chinese clothing in front of him was definitely not a normal person. Ye Zichen did not believe that the other person would exchange them for earthly goods.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s simple.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Snap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man snapped his fingers. Then very quickly, a black table appeared in front of Ye Zichen…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Brush, ink, paper and inkstone were all placed on the table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A white-robed man stood beside the table, holding a black box in his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, the young man also spoke up once more, and lifted his right thumb and index finger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want your one of your physical and one of your spiritual souls!”</span></p>
