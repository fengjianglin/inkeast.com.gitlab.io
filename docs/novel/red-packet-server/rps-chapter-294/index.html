 <p><span style>Chapter 294 – Not the Same Person</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This woman…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen forced a smile to his face. The only thing he could do at that point was empty his mind and disregard everything she said.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>God knows whether this woman could guess something from my expression or not.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I can’t let others know about my secret, and even for the ones close around me, I will only tell them everything after confirming some situations.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Mr. Ye is very nervous,” Qu Qitong smiled faintly. “Actually, I just said it randomly, you don’t have to mind it too much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, she nodded slightly towards Xiao Yumei and Ye Zichen, “It’s getting late, so I’ll be leaving first. Director Xiao, let me wish us a happy cooperation in advance.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Happy cooperation,” Xiao Yumei pursed her lips with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qu Qitong glanced at Ye Zichen meaningfully one more time before leaving.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment she left the office, her lips underneath her veil raised slightly, “Has x-ray vision, but at the same time not. Just what was he thinking just now? That man is rather amazing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Phew.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen let out a sigh of relief the moment the office door closed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had been completely tense during the short few minutes previously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Ye Zichen leaned limply on the sofa, Xiao Yumei smiled, “She’s an amazing person.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know this as well,” Ye Zichen shrugged unenergetically. “Being able to train one’s observation skills to her level makes her a miracle in the business circles as well, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei nodded in confirmation, “At the very least, I admit that I’m worse than her at it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What a terrifying woman,” Ye Zichen couldn’t help but exclaim.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since she was able to guess the thoughts of others through reading their actions and expressions very accurately, Ye Zichen truly suspected that woman knew how to read minds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh yeah,” Xiao Yumei suddenly took out a name card from her wallet on the table and handed it to Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is this?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wouldn’t you know after taking a look?” Xiao Yumei smiled faintly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen glanced at the name card…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Yushi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mobile Number: 15XXXXXXXXX</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those were the only two rows on the card. At the same time, Xiao Yumei also smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yang Yushi told me that it is her personal number. Although she said that it was for me, I could tell from her expression that she actually wanted to hand the card to you through me,” With that, Xiao Yumei smiled playfully. “Little man, you truly hid it well! I really couldn’t tell that you even knew Yang Yushi. What’s more, from the looks of the girl’s face… Zeze, you truly are a playboy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled softly, stood up, then placed the card back onto the table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She gave it to you, so you guys stay in touch. There is no need for contact between her and I.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you sure?” Xiao Yumei smiled. “Yang Yushi is the goddess of the hearts and dreams of countless men.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The heck does that have to do with me?” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes, then shrugged. “I admit that I’m rather fickle in love, but I can promise that I am sincere towards all of you. I’m merely a normal person, and it is already a blessing to have you all by my side. I can spare no energy to find more… A beauty’s favor is the hardest to accept. I am scared that I am unable to repay it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he stretched lazily with a smile towards Xiao Yumei, “You’re busy, so I won’t disturb your work any longer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had a smile on his face as he left the Maintaining Beauty. He did not pay any heed to the matter with Yang Yushi at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as he was about to drive away, he felt someone following him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He took back to take a look, and saw Yu, who was in a black coat, staring intensely at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you done yet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was truly a bit angry when he saw Yu.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Does this bastard think that I can’t get mad at all? Did he come over to kill me over and over again because I was too nice before?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn’t you clearly find out last time that you can’t beat me? You’re still not giving up? Do you really think that I can’t kill you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu revealed a look of confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a long while, he lifted his hand and scratched his head, “Didn’t I say that I won’t try to kill you already? What are you saying? I came this time because I have something to discuss with you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe…” Ye Zichen smiled coldly. “Your knife was almost on my throat last night and you’re saying that you won’t kill me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Impossible, I went out to buy clothes with Lingling yesterday,” Yu shook his head quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two of them looked at each other in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen tilted his head and looked at Yu’s face, which did not seem like he was lying.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Impossible, Yu did come to kill me last night.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I get it now,” At that moment, Yu, who stood ten meters away, suddenly spoke up. “Huo Da might have hired him…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What the hell?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The reason I came this time was to tell you that Huo Da returned from the capital to target you and the jewelry shop woman,” Yu frowned. “No wonder his expression seemed a bit weird when he found me yesterday. It is very possible that he found out about the relationship between us through some means.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Yu did not look like he was lying, Ye Zichen did not have Qu Qitong’s ability to tell whether Yu was actually lying just from observing his actions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had always believed in what his eyes saw, and he had seen Yu try to kill him the other day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though Yu said that now, Ye Zichen was still unable to believe him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>More importantly, the God of Fortune is doing things to Huo Da’s family behind the scenes. At this moment, Huo Da should be running around for his family’s business and should not have returned to Bingcheng to target Xiao Yumei and him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From Ye Zichen’s views, Yu’s words were filled with issues…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just to be on the safe side, Ye Zichen chose to keep his suspicion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Right now, I still cannot believe your words. If you want me to believe you, then just turn around and leave. We’ll pretend like we didn’t meet,” Ye Zichen pointed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu nodded, “I can understand your thoughts right now. If it really is that person, then he can indeed imitate me extremely well!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, he turned around and begun to walk away from the car park. Right before he left, he turned around again with a smile, “I, Yu, never goes back on his words. Since I said that I won’t kill you, then I won’t. Believe me if you want, but I am not guilty!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Yu directly left without any hesitation. When Ye Zichen saw this, even his belief had slightly wavered.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could the person that came to kill me yesterday really have not been Yu…?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But why are they so similar to the point that their voice, tone and weapons were exactly the same?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, Ye Zichen drove away from the car park while maintaining his doubts. Not long after he left, a shadow suddenly popped out from the wall of the car park.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is confirmed, Yu has gone over to the target’s side.”　　</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Original Chapter Teaser:</b>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p><strong>Yu:&nbsp;</strong>Hey.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Heh? Who... Oh, it's you...</p>
 <p><strong>Yu:&nbsp;</strong>I've got information.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Yeah, stand there and don't move. Now, tell me, are you here to kill me, again?</p>
 <p><strong>Yu:&nbsp;</strong>I have no idea on what you're talking about.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Uh-huh, that's what they all say.</p>
 <p><strong>Yu:&nbsp;</strong>If you don't believe me, then I'll just tell you what I have to say first?</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Fine, go on. But stay there and don't move.</p>
 <p><strong>Yu:&nbsp;</strong>Long story short, Huo Da's back and he contacted me again.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Then?</p>
 <p><strong>Yu:&nbsp;</strong>It seems like he's after you and everyone around you. Including but limited to Xiao Yumei and your mother.</p>
 <p><em>(Yu unconsciously steps forward)</em></p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Hold it right there! Don't come even a step closer to me.</p>
 <p><strong>Yu:&nbsp;</strong>I have been wondering for a while, just what is going on with you?</p>
