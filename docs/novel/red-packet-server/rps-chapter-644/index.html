 <p><span style>Chapter 644 – The Yellow Emperor’s Reincarnation has no presence</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Girl, what are you talking about? You said that I, Cui Fugui, am actually a Sky Immortal expert?” Cui Fugui smiled in confusion, then shook his head. “Although I really want to be that sort of almighty Sky Immortal, I am not! What’s more, what’s the ice attribute mutated heavenly spirit root you’re talking about? I don’t get it at all!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sire, do you still want to hide it even now?” the girl tilted her head with a smile, while her eyes turned purple. “You can’t escape in front of Luo Ying.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Immortal!?” the purple-robed elder frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luo Ying took a step back and nodded, “Master, he is indeed of the Sky Immortal level. He is using a secret art to hide it from you guys, but he cannot hide in front of &nbsp;someone from the Purple Eye clan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck, I can’t believe that Old White’s prediction was right,” the black-robed elder stood up from his chair with a frown. “A Sky Immortal really did come to Yonghe to become an outer sect disciple. Is there something wrong with this person’s brain?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Black, I feel rather troubled hearing you say that. Do you still feel like he came to become an outer sect disciple?” the white-robed elder shook his head with a sigh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The black-robed elder did not understand, “Then what else could he have come here for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shouldn’t you tell us about your purpose here now?” the purple-robed elder stood up from his chair and pointed forward. A trace of spiritual energy flowed out and formed a rope that tried to bind Cui Fugui.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cui Fugui raised his hand and knocked the rope down with a smirk, “Let’s not use this sort of parlor trick. But I really am unlucky, I didn’t think that I would meet a member of the Purple Eye Clan here. What’s more, she’s an extremely talented one! Ahh, there is no shame in I, Old Cui, being exposed!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cui Fugui cracked his neck and smiled. Then, his face gradually transformed into that of a handsome youth’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cui Twelve!” the purple-robed elder was shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the people began to blabber, Ye Zichen felt very displeased. According to his plans, he should be the one who was found out. Then, he was going to reveal his identity and tell them to fetch the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But that wasn’t happening.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>But who the hell is this Cui Fugui? Wait, no, he’s f*cking called Cui Twelve now.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why is he a Sky Immortal as well?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Also, what’s wrong with that woman? Couldn’t she look at me first? Why the heck did she look at Cui Fugui first!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Uhm…” Ye Zichen couldn’t help but try to interrupt everyone, but it was as if nobody in the hall heard him. All of them were focused on Cui Twelve.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen cursed silently in his mind, then couldn’t help but speak up, “I’m a Sky Immortal expert too. Can you guys pay attention over here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This isn’t somewhere for you to mess around,” the purple-robed elder frowned. “Hu Qing, take these outer sect disciples away.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cui Twelve raised his eyebrows, while Ye Zichen rolled his eyes with a long sigh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who the heck is messing around with you!?” Ye Zichen was completely speechless. He released the spiritual energy hidden within his body with a frown. “I’m a Sky Immortal too. F*ck, do you believe me now? I’m a Sky Immortal too!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The hall was completely silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hu Qing, who tried to pull Ye Zichen away, quickly took a few steps back and looked at the two people in front of him in shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both of them were people he had high hopes for, but he never expected them to both be Sky Immortals.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why’s there another one?” the black-robed man raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The purple-robed elder raised his eyebrows, then couldn’t help but turn towards Cui Twelve, “Lord Cui, is he also…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No,” Cui Twelve shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see,” the purple-robed elder nodded, then disregarded Ye Zichen. Instead, he returned his focus onto Cui Twelve. “Lord Cui, I wonder what business do you have in the Immortal Region?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Would you believe me if I told you that I just came to play?” Cui Twelve pursed his lips. “But I really didn’t expect that you would recognize me. It seems like I am rather known in the Immortal Region!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How could we not know Your Highness?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was completely and utterly speechless.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just what the hell is going on?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why are they chatting by themselves again? Cui Twelve is a Sky Immortal, but I am too. Why is the different in treatment so huge!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait a sec, you two,” Ye Zichen frowned. “I’m a Sky Immortal too, can you guys give me some time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old White, let this Sky Immortal expert take a seat,” the purple-robed elder said mindlessly, then smile towards Cui Twelve. “The Twelfth Highness of the Four Direction Palace naturally has his own reputation. However, please accept this old man’s apology as I do not believe Your Highness is just here to play.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who was about to throw a tantrum, stopped when he heard Four Direction Palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, the white-robed man also walked over with a smile, “Daoist friend, please come this way.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm,” Ye Zichen nodded, then followed the white-robed elder to the side to sit down. However, his gaze remained fixated on Cui Twelve.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Four Direction Palace.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Youmuu once mentioned that Liu Qing is in the Four Direction Palace as well.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What else could I have come for?” Cui Twelve shrugged. “I just wanted to experience the life in your sect, but then I got found out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If Your Highness would like to experience life here, then you can continue to stay here. I can give Your Highness the position of the Fist Elder.” The purple-robed man said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cui Twelve shook his head with a chuckle. “Never mind, it feels rather weird after getting found out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then, Your Highness…” the purple-robed man continued to speak in a testing manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Cui Twelve shrugged. “Brother Ye seems to be in more of a hurry, how about talking with him first?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How can he compare up to Your Highness!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen suddenly clenched his fist, then relaxed it once more.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Fine, I, the reincarnation of the Yellow Emperor, has no status at all. I can’t match that Highness from the Four Direction Palace.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that so? I wonder if you’ll continue to say that when Brother Ye tells you about his identity,” Cui Twelve said meaningfully as if he knows something. Then, he slowly walked towards Ye Zichen and took out a note, which he stuffed into Ye Zichen’s hand, before patting his shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Ye, it was very nice to meet you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen held the note subconsciously, then looked at Cui Twelve in the eye. Cui Twelve merely shrugged, then raised his eyebrows, “In order to prove that I just came to play, I won’t stay here any longer, so you guys can stop worrying.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Cui Twelve left the hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he finally left, the purple-robed elder finally calmed down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior Brother, that person just now…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t ask what you shouldn’t. Knowing is of no benefit to you guys,” the purple elder frowned. Then, he set his gaze upon Ye Zichen and squinted his eyes. “Sir, I wonder…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s finally my turn to speak?” Ye Zichen twitched his mouth. “Seriously, so the Yellow Emperor’s reincarnation cannot be compared to that Highness from the Four Direction Palace? Zeze, whatever, this Immortal Region is nothing special. I’m done here.”</span></p>
 <p></p>

 <p></p>
 <p><em>My god, she&nbsp;made a mistake, she&nbsp;must have. Otherwise, why&nbsp;is she pointing at the wrong person! Seriously what the heck, this was not how it was supposed to go.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p><em>Ugh, why the heck is she infatuated with Cui Fugui? It can't be because he's a middle-aged dude,&nbsp;can it? C'mon, please stop kidding me. Now, hurry up and look this way and notice that I'm a Sky Immortal as well. C'mon, c'mon, c'mon...</em></p>
 <p>As always, nothing actually worked Ye Zichen's way. Even though his plan seemed flawless and was going perfectly, it still somehow ended up not in his favor. Now that Cui Fugui has drawn the attention of the higher-ups already... What was Ye Zichen going to do? Is he going to... turn around and walk off? Is he going to throw a tantrum? Or is he going to try to make them pay attention to him some other way?</p>
