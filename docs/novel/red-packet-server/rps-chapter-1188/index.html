 <p>“Are you trying to threaten me? Did you all see that? He’s threatening me!” Ye Zichen’s eyes widened in exaggerated terror. “What a joke. I was so scared just now. This sort of person is too despicable!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He looked at the screen reflecting Chen Jiannan in utter disgust, then spread his awareness out of the Yao-Sealing Pagoda.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Hurry up and kill me, then.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Fine, I’ll grant your wish.” Chen Jiannan was in no mood to spout a load of garbage. He hefted his divine sword and swung at the Yao-Sealing Pagoda with all his might.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Zichen was actually quote bit nervous; although he’d had the pagoda for a while now, he had no idea what its defenses were like.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wham!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Chen Jiannan’s first sword attack landed, but the Yao-Sealing Pagoda remained unharmed.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The second attack hit.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Then the third.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He attacked for a wholee hour, but the Yao-Sealing Pagoda took no damage at all.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Heh, the Five Elements Great Emperor’s Yao-Sealing Pagoda, Emperor Hades’ masterpiece, sure doesn’t disappoint!” Ye Zichen couldn’t help but gasp; the pagoda’s shocking defenses meant he could rest at ease.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Swinging his sword countless times had cost Chen Jiannan an enormous amount of energy. He stopped, and plopped a few recover pills into his mouth.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When he saw that his opponent had stopped, Ye Zichen felt someone out of sorts. “Are you up to it or not? Come on in and kill me already! Swing harder!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Chen Jiannan was sitting cross-legged and recovering his divine power. Ye Zichen’s taunts irritatede him so much, they almost threw his divine power into turmoil.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After a while, he suppressed his fury. Once he’d recovered a third of his divine power he started attacking again, but he no longer went all out. After an hour with no progress, he figured that he could swing his sword all year without any results.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Your spatial divine artifact’s defenses are shocking.” To Ye Zichen’s surprise, Chen Jiannan didn’t sound as angry as before. A faint smile tugged at his lips as he looked at the tiny speck of dust that was the Yao-Sealing Pagoda. “I admit that with my power, I can’t possibly break through.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Was he backing down?</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Despite himself, Ye Zichen curled his lips. <em>Aren’t you giving up too easily?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“If you can’t break through, why don’t you just leave? Do you want to celebrate new years with me or something?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>‘I naturally can’t leave without the Xuan-Yuan Sword,” said Chen Jiannan amiably. “Although I can’t break through your defenses…. You can’t escape either. If you want to just wait it out, I can wait here with you.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>With that, Chen Jiannan plopped down beside the miniscule pagoda, crossed his legs, and started meditating.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>His words enlightened his companions. They’d been overly focused on the goal at hand, desperate to break through the pagoda and seize the Xuan-Yuan Sword.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>They were so overcomewith despair at their inability to break through that they forgot: although they couldn’t break in, Ye Zichen couldn’t leave either.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The supremes started divvying up labor. They couldn’t all continuously lock onto the speck of dust; they’d quickly exhaust their mental energy.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But while they might lack other things, they didn’t lack manpower…..</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>They’d just have to take shifts.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“.....” Ye Zichen’s smile froze. This was the result he’d feared the most.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Master, what should we do now?” Meng Huairong and Jiao Qi furrowed their brows.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Zichen licked his lips, then looked at the screen and the meditating supremes. “You want to wait it out? Fine then, go ahead and wait. Once I open the second floor of the Yao-Sealing Pagoda, you’re all doomed.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Zichen’s eyes flashed with cold light. He waved his hands and snorted, “Give me a quiet room. I’m going into seclusion!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Give me one too, please,” said Xuan-Yuan Xiang. “After properly fusing with the godheaad, who knows? I might be able to help out too.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>….</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Zichen sat cross-legged in a private room. He was roughly a first-stage earth supreme.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Although he’d achieved small success in all five elements, he still couldn’t open the second floor of the Yao-Sealing Pagoda. It was obvious that there was a strength requirement to open it as well.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But using his comprehension of the Five Elements to boost his cultivation clearly wasn’t realistic.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“So, you want to wait it out with me?” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes and took out a pitch-black secret tome. This was none other than the book he’d stolen from the warlock of the Time Corridor, the Devil Dharma Body.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Forming a Dharma Body was necessary for any supreme who hoped to become a diviner, but in fact, no more than ten percent succeeded.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The resources needed to succeed were far too numerous; ordinary people hadn’t have that much cash to play around with.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Most supremes who succeeded in condensing dharma bodies were disciples of major family clans. Only a few relied on sheer willpower and years of hard work to accumulate the necessary supplies.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Of course, the higher the cost, the more you got out of it.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>If you could successfully form a supreme dharma body, even if it was the weakest variety, most other supremes were no match for you.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Zichen flipped through the book, and the first thing he saw was the list of necessary resources. The list of things he needed to pay attention to while condensing his dharma body came next.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Hundred tails grass, heavenly god fruit, ten-thousand-year black jade….”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The list of dazzlingly luxurious materials stunned him; despite his vast breadth of experience, there were quite a few even he hadn’t heard of.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>For instance, devil fruits.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wasn’t that the thing Luffy ate in One Piece?</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This was a necessary ingredient to form a Devil Dharma Body. Did that mean that after successfully condensing it, his dharma body could stretch like rubber?</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Jiao Qi.” Just looking was of no use. Whether he could condense it or not depended on whether the Yao-Sealing Pagoda had sufficient reserves or not.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Master.” Jiao Qi stepped inside.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Zichen tossed him the secret tome. “Could you take a look and see if we have enough resources in storage for this dharma body technique?”</p>
 <p>“The Devil Dharma Body?” Jiao Qi arched his brows. There were one hundred and eight varieties of dharma body, but he’d never heard of this one.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He glance down at the list, then froze in bewilderment.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Was this really a supreme dharma body technique? &nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>That was enough resources to condense ten supreme dharma bodies! He’d never once seen or heard of such an expensive dharma body.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, the resources needed were all raree and valuable.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>For instance, ten-thousand year black jade. Ordinary black Jade was valuable already, but he wanted ten-thousand year black jad? And one hundred and fifty kilos of it at that!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>And havenly god fruits! Those were used to forge diviner pills, which could improve your odds of breaking through to the diviner level by thirty percent. They were so precious, yet this technique demanded a full twenty of them.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Two hundred branches of thousand-year-old divine wood.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Six perfect divine inkstones.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Metal, wood, water, fire, and earth element supreme souls, one of each.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The heart of a demon god.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Am I dreaming?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Jiao Qi was steady and even-tempered, but even he gasped. If they offered these ingredients up for sale, even diviners would sell themselves into slavery in exchange.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yet all these incomparably precious ingredients were needed just to condense a supreme dharma body?</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This absolutely had to be a joke!</p>
