 <p><span style>Chapter 123 – King Qinguang got captured</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Dahai directly confessed the entirety of his plan with Hao Wen. During his speech, he didn’t hide anything, and what he said wasn’t that much different from what Dongfang Wenyi said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That that moment, Ye Zichen finally stopped worrying. This grandson had sincerely submitted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen set him away, then remembered he haven’t sent Third Prince Nezha’s and the God of Food’s orders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Scan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha’s red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Scan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The God of Food’s red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen labelled the recipients of the red packets, then closed the chat group. At that moment, Su Yan called him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen hung up after a simple chat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at Zhuge Kongming, who was beside him, and patted his head, “I’ll be going now. Stay here properly to watch the place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhuge Kongming giggled. Then, Ye Zichen specifically left Blackie there as well in order to ensure this child’s safety.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So bored, do you wanna chat?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Ye Zichen left the supermarket, Zhuge Kongming suddenly smiled, and said to Blackie, who was in midair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen naturally didn’t know about the situation in the supermarket, since he stood underneath the girl’s dormitory in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same, Su Yan had called him to tell him that they didn’t want the tickets anymore. They had clearly acted like they had to get the tickets, but now that they didn’t want it, Ye Zichen really didn’t understand what was going on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A woman’s thoughts are truly hard to understand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, Su Yan walked out of the girl’s dormitory.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What, you don’t want the concert tickets anymore?” Ye Zichen asked in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan pouted with a nod, “Yeah, I don’t want it anymore, I’ll give it to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Like that, Su Yan slapped the two concert tickets back in Ye Zichen’s hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was very worried as he held the two tickets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did I make you do to make you unhappy?” Ye Zichen asked carefully. It shouldn’t be, their atmosphere was great at noon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They didn’t meet each other after that, so there was no reason for her to get angry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan giggled when she saw Ye Zichen’s careful look, “No, it’s just that our roommate got four concert tickets from somewhere. Keke and I thought about it, then decided that since the tickets were a waste with us, we might as well give it to you, since people from your dorm might be able to use it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are they infield tickets as well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she spoke, Su Yan’s phone rang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My roommate is telling me to go back to play cards, so I’m going to go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh,” Ye Zichen nodded on spot in a bit of confusion. Then, Su Yan, who was about to enter the dormitory, turned back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And smooched his cheek.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bye bye.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled idiotically as he watched Su Yan return to the dormitory.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seems like he didn’t lose anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Back in the dormitory, ever since Ye Zichen became good in League of Legends, his roommates all made them carry him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment he entered the room, his roommates all urged him to quickly turn on his computer to play together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since he had nothing better to do, Ye Zichen turned on his computer and got ready to play with them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, at that moment, his phone rang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your intimacy level with White Impermanence increased by 100. Current intimacy level: 400.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received 3000 Heaven and Earth Merits. Your position in the Underworld has been promoted. Current official position: Level 3 Ghost Servant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was a bit confused when he saw these two messages.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, White Impermanence sent him a message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“King Qinguang’s birthday feast ended.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi, what is it! Hurry up and log in!” Kang Peng shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not playing anymore, you guys play.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen jumped onto his bed and clicked on his chat with White Impermanence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems like King Qinguang really liked your present?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, King Qinguang was quite happy when he saw the row of cigarettes, and he even praised me. It’s just that the birthday feast…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows when he saw the White Impermanence’s message, “Praising you is good, what happened with the birthday feast?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You also know that the Underworld is under the management of the Heavenly Court. They have clear rules stating that Underworld Officials cannot have birthday feasts. But it wasn’t a big deal before since the Heavenly Court wouldn’t know, but this time, the Heavenly Court suddenly came down to check. There was no helping it, so the birthday feast could only end rashly.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Didn’t I let leak this secret!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He unintentionally told geezer Taibai this information, he didn’t think that so much trouble would occur because of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what happened to King Qinguang?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Taibai Jinxing took King Qinguang back to the Heavenly Court, we don’t know what’s going to happen. Now, the other nine Yama Kings are discussing about it. If the Heavenly Court doesn’t let him go, then us, the Underworld, might bring our army up to take him back.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So severe!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen scratched his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Heavenly Court didn’t seem to have such a big grudge with the Underworld when he watched Journey to the West. Why did he notice that they seemed to be opposing factions after getting into contact with them?</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t too surprising though, who would want to be a lackey for life!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maybe the guys in the Underworld got sick of being grandsons and wanted to be the big boss now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Ye Zichen definitely didn’t want to see the Heavenly Court and Underworld fight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His small supermarket had just started up. If they were to f*cking fight, where was he supposed to sell stuff to earn cultivation experience?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“White Impermanence, tell those nine Yama Kings to not get impulsive. There aren’t any benefits for either side if they were to fight.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah,” White Impermanence clearly agreed with his words as well. “I don’t want them to fight either, but I don’t have any authority in the Underworld. I’m just a puny Level 7 Ghost servant, I haven’t even reached the position of a Ghost Messenger. How could the nine Yama Kings listen to me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were ten levels of ghost servants in the Underworld. Above Level 10 was ghost messengers. It was about the same in the Heavenly Court. There were ten levels of Celestial Officials, above Level 10 was the Heavenly Celestials.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The method of promotion as simple. Cultivation experience as well as Heaven and Earth Merits!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Promotion would occur when they reach a certain amount.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A Level 7 Ghost servant wasn’t really that high ranking, but nor was it low. However, they were small fries compared to the nine Yama Kings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sat on the bed and scratched himself!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Should he tell Taibai Jinxing that the Underworld wants to revolt?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately squelched the thought after it appeared.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That damn geezer Taibai Jinxing.</span></i><span style> If he told him, then the geezer would definitely lead the heavenly army and trample the Underworld.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing was clearly a kind elder, why did he have such a bad temper now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed like Ye Zichen had to rely on himself to deal with this issue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since he was between the Underworld and Heavenly Court, he might be able to act as a mediator.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How about this, White Impermanence, pull me into the group, I have a way of saving King Qinguang.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“One moment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since White Impermanence had an intimacy level of Trusted with Ye Zichen, she believe Ye Zichen’s words unconditionally.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang has sent you a friend request.</span></p>
