 <p><span style>Chapter 38 – Want to leave after doing it?</span></p>
 <p><span style>In room 1305 of Golden Spring Hotel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was at a loss about what to do as she looked at Li Jiayi, who was lying on the bed as if she were made out of mud.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was his first time coming across this sort of situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop calling me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was a bit annoyed, that girl really didn’t know how seductive she looked right now, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen filled the bathtub in the bathroom with cold water, then threw Li Jiayi in it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You need to calm down.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After throwing her into the bathtub, Ye Zichen walked out of the bathroom to give Bai Yu a call.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi, why are you calling me at such a late hour?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ol’ Two, what should I do if a girl was drugged?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Yu studied clinical medicine. Although Ye Zichen wasn’t sure whether he would know the way or not, he figured it was worth a shot to ask.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s simple…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Yu blabbered on for a long time, then he finally came to a single conclusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She’d be fine after doing it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes, he also knew about that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is there any other way…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Yu hesitated for a moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yep!”</span></p>
 <p><span style> Ye Zichen’s heart started beating intensely after hanging up the call.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Yu did give him a solution, but actually using it was a bit…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh, why am I thinking so much, it’s not like I have any better ideas.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen entered the bathroom once again, Li Jiayi was already lying in the water like a rag doll. </span></p>
 <p><span style>When he picked her up from the bathtub, she was like a magnet finding her other half, as she stuck right onto him…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Li Jiayi, don’t blame me, this is all for your own good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that being said, Ye Zichen chucked her onto the bed and stripped her pants off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the following day, Li Jiayi sat up, while rubbing her head, when the first ray of sunshine shone through the curtains.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she saw Ye Zichen, who was sleeping beside her, she suddenly blushed for some unknown reason.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In order to deal with Li Jiayi, it could be said that Ye Zichen had been busy the entire night.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he felt someone pushing him, Ye Zichen opened his eyes blurrily, and saw Li Jiayi looking down at him loving eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You-You’re awake!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stuttered. Very quickly, he noticed something.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Jiayi’s face was as smooth as white jade. Her birthmark on her left cheek was gone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your face…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Jiayi exclaimed, then reached her hand towards her left cheek. Then, she frantically looked around the bed, and saw Ye Zichen reach his hand over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you looking for this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was really confused, he already noticed the birthmark on her face from the first time he saw Li Jiayi in high school.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Back then, he had felt pity for the girl. If it wasn’t for the birthmark, she might had been a girl that was beyond bright.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But only now did he finally f*cking know, this birthmark was fake!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This girl had actually lied to everyone in their school for three years!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Give it back to me,” Li Jiayi snatched the birthmark over and stuck it back on her face. When Ye Zichen saw that, he sighed helplessly, “I already saw it, there isn’t a need to pretend in front of me anymore, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No telling.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who am I supposed to tell? I’m barely in contact with anyone from high school,” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes. “I don’t get it, don’t girls like being beautiful? Just how many people go for plastic surgery to make themselves prettier. Yet, you deliberately made yourself uglier. What benefits does it have for you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s none of your business.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Jiayi clenched her teeth and tried to get up from the bed, but the tearing pain from her lower body and the redness on the bedsheets caused her to slightly frown.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He actually…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, thinking about the previous night, it seemed like she took the initiative.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Forget about last night, pretend like nothing happened. I don’t need you to take responsibility.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright then.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded without thinking deeply. The situation last night was kind of difficult to explain. Girls usually had thin skin, since she didn’t say anything, there was no need for him to say anything either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s lack of hesitation touched Li Jiayi’s heart. Back then, she had the best impression of Ye Zichen out of everyone in the high school.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Otherwise, she wouldn’t have said that sort of thing after seeing Ye Zichen the previous day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She never thought that he was that sort of person. He wanted to just leave after doing it with her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She could only blame herself for being wrong about him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She stared fiercely at Ye Zichen, then limped out. Ye Zichen jumped down from the bed and wanted to help her. However, she merely pushed him away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop being so fake.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, she ran away from the hotel room in tears. Meanwhile, Ye Zichen stood at the entrance of the room, while being utterly confused.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s this?</span></i><span style> He didn’t do anything though.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thinking back to how Li Jiayi seemed to have her period, Ye Zichen scratched his head, </span><i><span style>are all women so weird when they’re on their period?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>After checking out of the hotel, Ye Zichen drove back to the dorm. Right after entering the room, he saw Bai Yu, who was just getting ready to go out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ol’ Two,” Ye Zichen patted his shoulders and continued to walk into the room. He didn’t sleep well in the hotel, so he had to make up for it now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t leave,” Bai Yu suddenly stopped him, and smiled ambiguously. “You felt great last night, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great my ass, laozi is about to die of tiredness,” Ye Zichen pushed him aside and was about to continue in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck! You really f*cking did what I told you to do?” Bai Yu exclaimed as if he had discovered a new continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you think? Am I the sort of person that would take advantage of people? If it wasn’t because I had been single for twenty years and trained out a terrific arm, my muscles would have melted last night. However, I’m telling you, that fatty was a true grandson, he gave some sort of unknown drug to Li Jiayi…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rubbed his sore right arm, while Bai Yu grabbed his shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who did you say just now? Li Jiayi?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, our high school classmate, Li Jiayi.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No wonder,” Bai Yu showed a “so that’s why” expression and replied. “Stop pretending to be pure with me, if it was Li Jiayi, even I wouldn’t dare to touch her. Alright, bro’s gonna clean up. You should get some rest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Yu waved the towel on his shoulder and walked out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who was standing at the entrance to the room, smiled helplessly, it seemed like all his high school classmates could remember about Li Jiayi was her birthmark.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, if there were ever a day when they found out Li Jiayi’s birthmark was fake, just how would they react?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen thought back to the scene back at the hotel and Li Jiayi, who didn’t have her birthmark on. She was even prettier than Su Yan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He really didn’t understand, why such a beautiful girl wanted to pretend to be ugly?</span></p>
 <p><span style>After returning to the room, Ye Zichen got ready to sleep, but right after lying down..</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The phone Ye Zichen had put beside his pillow suddenly buzzed intensely.</span></p>
