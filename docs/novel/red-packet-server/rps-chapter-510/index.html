 <p><i><span style>F*ck!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>He’s huge!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked up at Yuan Hong, who had already transformed into his avatar, then went over and compared himself to the side of his foot…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Mhm, I’m exactly as tall as his foot.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t move around recklessly like that. He can’t see a little ant like you after taking the form of his avatar. My little sister’s heart will hurt a lot if he steps on you,” Su Liu’er grabbed Ye Zichen by the collar and leaped backwards bringing him along.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows, “Who did you call a little ant? Say it again if you dare.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So what if I say it a hundred times more? Would you attack me? Don’t forget, I’m a woman, and a woman capable fighting at that. More importantly, I’m your older sister-in-law.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Ye Zichen instantly submitted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn’t retort at all!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After landing at a safe position with Ye Zichen, Su Liu’er looked up at Yuan Hong, “I’ll leave it to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Leave it to me. If I help you deal with this problem, then can I try courting you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Never mind the courting, but I can give you a chance to go on a date with me,” Su Liu’er smiled softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Deal!” Yuan Hong answered with a low voice, but he was beyond happy in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The price of activating his avatar was quite huge, but it was worth it if he got a chance to go on a date with Su Liu’er in exchange. Yuan Hong very quickly stopped smiling. </span><i><span style>This is the best chance to display my manly charm, an opportunity like this doesn’t come very often.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Formation Master, I do want to see just how capable is a Formation Grandmaster!” Yuan Hong roared as he smashed down with the stick in his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Su Yiyun’s face no longer showed any kind of relaxed expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, he turned his gaze towards Ye Zichen…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Actually, I was just kidding. I have no interest in that woman, Xiao Yumei, but her situation in the Demon Realm isn’t so good. Ye Zichen, come and snatch her back if you can!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A spatial rift instantly appeared in front of him, and he snuck into the rift the moment the stick landed at where he had been.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Su Yiyun, take me with you!” the black-skinned man ran quickly towards the rift.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Su Yiyun ignored him and snorted, “Grandpa isn’t going to play with you guys anymore!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoosh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The rift disappeared, and the stick also landed on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The black-skinned man frantically dodged the attacks of the sticks, but when he finally reached the spatial rift, which Su Yiyun had opened up, he could only watch as the spatial rift disappeared in front of his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Su Yiyun!” the man shouted with bloodshot eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The humongous Yuan Hong snorted softly, as if he was very unhappy with Su Yiyun running away. </span><i><span style>But at least there’s still one left.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop shouting, couldn’t you tell that he intentionally left and discarded you?” Su Liu’er snickered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man bit his lips with his bloodshot eyes, and purple blood begun to flow out from the tear on his lips…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s die together!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, his body begun to swell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yuan Hong, retreat quickly, he wants to self explode!” Su Liu’er shouted worriedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuan Hong also understood the demon’s intentions, so he retracted his avatar as quick as possible, but the dark-skinned man laughed maniacally.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, die, let’s die together!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His veins popped up, and his skin exploded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck, it’s too late!” Seeing that he was unable to avoid it, Yuan Hong clenched his teeth…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I’m going to gamble!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He dashed to where Su Liu’er was as quick as he could and used his own body to shield her. </span><i><span style>This way, at the very least, the self explosion wouldn’t hurt Su Liu’er.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even after a good thirty seconds, there was still no explosion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They looked back slowly and saw that a daoist elder had suddenly appeared beside the dark skinned man alongside a cocky looking young man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We, the Immortal Region, want to take this person away. I wonder if the Master of Fox Yaos and Lord Long Arm Ape can agree to that?” the elder touched his beard and smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuan Hong also retracted his avatar with a frown, while Su Liu’er knitted her eyebrows. “You’re from the Immortal Region?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!” the elder nodded. “We have been investigating the Demon Realm, we want to take this demon back for interrogation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Geezer, you really do know how to take advantage of things,” Yuan Hong raised his eyebrows and snorted. “Laozi fought so hard, and you actually want to bring him away just like that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Commander Yuan really knows how to joke. You didn’t seem to have done all that much have you? In fact, it was the young man beside you who had an intense fight with the demons’ formation master,” the elder continued to smile softly and pointed towards Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s my bro, so it’s the same,” Yuan Hong replied shamelessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, at that very moment, a pile of spiritual items suddenly appeared on the grassland on the hills.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is the compensation for Commander Yuan activating your avatar. I wonder if we can bring him back like this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahem…” Yuan Hong was slightly moved after seeing all that. However, he still didn’t feel right being the one to make decision, thus, he could only rub his hands and look towards Ye Zichen and Su Liu’er. “What do you guys think?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have no interests in demons. Since the Immortal Region wants to take him away, then let them,” Su Liu’er continued to reply using the ice-cold tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t mind,” Ye Zichen also replied softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, scourge,” as Ye Zichen spoke, the cocky young man who arrived with the elder suddenly twitched his mouth and snorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s gaze instantly turned dark.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The elder also smacked the young man on the back of his head, “Stop talking, go and apologize.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I refuse,” the young man snorted stubbornly. “Was I wrong? He is the scourge, if it wasn’t for him…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shut up. You’re being locked up for half a year after we return!” the elder raised his eyebrows and scolded angrily. Then, he immediately smiled apologetically. “My disciple is rather young, and doesn’t quite know how to speak. I hope you take no offense to that. This old man will be bringing the demon back now. See you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, the elder and the cocky young man disappeared with a leap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuan Hong frowned at the place they left from and said coldly, “That grandson was insulting my bro just now? F*ck, if he didn’t run so quickly, laozi would’ve given him the stick.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You? Don’t kid me!” Su Liu’er snorted in disdain. “Couldn’t you tell how strong the elder was? If it was your big bro, then he might have been able to fight him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehehe…” Yuan Hong scratched his head with a coy smile. However, that was merely because it came from Su Liu’er, he would have just smashed anyone else who said that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But it is strange. Didn’t the Demon Realm get demolished a long time ago? Why are there still demons? What’s more, this spatial gate was opened in the land of us fox yaos. It seems like I’ll have to check all of the surrounding seals.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then our date…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The date’s going to be reinforcing the fox yaos’ seals. You got a problem with that?” Su Liu’er raised her eyebrows coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuan Hong was naturally unwilling. In the date of his dreams, there was definitely a bit of romance, and a bit of adult actions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he didn’t dare to say anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem, no problem,” Yuan Hong forced a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did Su Liu’er nod in satisfaction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, Ye Zichen continued to stand on the spot with a pondering look…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Scourge?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Was he talking about me?</span></i></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Original Chapter Teaser:</strong>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Muahahahaha. I look damn cool when I unleash my avatar, right? Muahahaha!</p>
 <p>Finally, I will have a chance to show off in front of Su Liu'er! I shall trample these pesky demonic insects for none shall invade the land of the fox yaos under Liu'er's reign!</p>
 <p>Ugh, that formation master looks like trouble. His cultivation level doesn't seem all too high, but formations befitting that of a formation grandmaster... No matter what, I have to get rid of him first!</p>
 <p>Actually, I know! I can ask Liu'er to court me if I defeat them! Yes! This is a wonderful idea! She shouldn't resist me too much after seeing my cool side, right?</p>
