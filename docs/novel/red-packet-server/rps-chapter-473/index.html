 <p><span style>Chapter 473 – Pill Refiner</span></p>
 <p><span style>The atmosphere in the room immediately froze. Zuo Liang looked back and forth between Ye Zichen and the pill refining master, while keeping it mostly on the former.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This guy is actually a pill refining master?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Although Master Shao Qing did not say anything specifically, Zuo Liang could already tell from his expression that Ye Zichen was a pill refiner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were four grades of pill refiners: spiritual, earth, human and sky (celestial) ; and each grade was then further split into tiers of beginner, adept, master, maestro…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The symbols on their robes indicated their grades. The moon represented their grades, while the number of stars represented their tiers, but if a pill refiner was to become a sky grade pill refining maestro, then the symbol would be a sun instead!</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, it was not hard for Zuo Liang to tell from Shao Qing’s way of addressing Ye Zichen that the kid wasn’t just a bit better than Shao Qing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those in the pill refining circles generally addressed each other as daoist friends so as long as they are of the same grade.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They would only address someone of a higher grade as sire.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Doesn’t that mean that Ye Zichen is a pill refiner of at least the human grade!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Spring Returning Pill, it is a spiritual grade pill. However, the recovery amount is three times that of a normal one. Ex-Excuse me, are you a human grade maestro?” Shao Qing’s tone was filled with respect. Although pill refiners took a long time in polishing their skills…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He did not dare to directly refute the possibility of Ye Zichen being a human grade maestro due to his age.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When pill refiners reach a certain level, their appearance could not longer be used to judge them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Human grade maestro?” Ye Zichen revealed a look of disdain. </span><i><span style>The pills in the Treasure Shop should be refined by Old Lord Taishang, and he was definitely the best when it came to pill refining, so a human grade maestro was nothing. </span></i><span style>“Don’t worry about so much, I’m just asking you whether you guys are taking it in or not!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, yes, yes. We’ll take however much you have. I wonder if you have any other pills for sale?” Shao Qing felt a bit frantic. </span><i><span style>Judging from this sire’s expression, he doesn’t seem to only be a human grade maestro.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But… are there pill refiners above sky grade on the outskirts of the Immortal Region? Could this master have come from within the Immortal Region? Also, why is a sky grade pill refiner refining this sort of pill?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Naturally.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen took out Spirit Focusing Pill. It was also a pill that cost a hundred cultivation experience in the experience per pill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shao Qing carefully picked it up and put it into his mouth…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Spirit Focusing Pill, the effects are also three times that of a normal one!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How much do you want to give me for the pills?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows. He wasn’t trying to show off. He only wanted to buy the Barrier Breaking Grass.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Two thousand per pill. How many do you want to sell?” Shao Qing squinted his eyes and clenched his teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The price he offered was already very high. Normally speaking, they would only use one thousand seven hundred or eight hundred. The reason he offered so much higher was to leave a higher impression for that lord.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How much is needed for the Barrier Breaking Grass?” Ye Zichen turned around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Liang licked his lips, his older sister had said that they can’t accept any no matter what. “About this…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Liang, your sister wants to mess around, do you want to mess around as well!?” Shao Qing glared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Liang quickly smiled and shrunk his neck, “I can’t decide, so I’ll have to go and ask my sister.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, he quickly ran out, leaving Shao Qing in the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shao Qing asked in a testing manner, “Sire, the reason that you are buying Barrier Breaking Grass…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Refine Barrier Breaking Pills!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shao Qing’s expression only became more respectful the moment Ye Zichen said that. Barrier Breaking Pill could only be refined by those above the adept sky grade, and even then, the success rate was extremely low.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can sell you guys one if this deal succeeds,” Ye Zichen wasn’t sure whether Zuo Mo would make it even more difficult for him. Since Shao Qing seemed to have a rather high status in Treasure Tower, if he could get this old man to help convince Zuo Mo, then selling them one after he gave the materials to Old Lord Taishang to refine wasn’t an issue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“About this… Sire, let me just directly gift you the Barrier Breaking Grass as a representative of Treasure Tower. If you refine the Barrier Breaking Pill successfully, and there are extras, then do please sell Treasure Tower one. We will certainly buy it using a high price,” Shao Qing said excitedly. A Barrier Breaking Pill directly meant the production of a Sky Immortal. </span><i><span style>Just what grade is this sire…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He finally accepted everything. Previously, he was actually wondering why someone of the sire’s grade was actually buying Barrier Breaking Grass by selling Pills, and now… Even what the sire said was a lie and he can’t refine a pill, but he definitely has someone backing him since he could take out all those pills. Thus, Shao Qing decided take the bet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ten strands of Barrier Breaking Grass was truly nothing compared to a Barrier Breaking Pill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s rather awkward, but since you said that, I can’t refuse you. Of course, I won’t rip you off…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoosh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two thousand jade vials suddenly appeared in the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Here is a thousand Spring Returning Pills and a thousand Spirit Focusing Pills. Also, if I get extra Barrier Breaking Pills, then I’ll gift them to the Treasure Tower.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sire, thank you so much!” Shao Qing answered gratefully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Zuo Liang hurriedly ran to the auction stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Mo couldn’t help but raise her eyebrows when she saw her little brother’s hurried expression, “How was it? You sent him away?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sis, there’s an issue,” Zuo Liang gulped, then said. “That guy is a pill refiner, and seems to be of an extremely high grade. Even Master Shao Qing called him sire!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Impossible!” Zuo Liang was shocked. </span><i><span style>How can a pill refiner be so young, and actually be called sire by Shao Qing, that’s too ridiculous!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s more, if he really is a pill refiner above the human grade, then why does he need to exchange items to buy a strand of Barrier Breaking Grass!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Bring me over!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The door to the secret room opened, and when Zuo Mo entered, she immediately saw that the room was filled with jade vials.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where’s Ye Zichen!?” Zuo Mo raised her eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shao Qing, who was sitting on the chair, stood up, “Zuo Mo, gift those ten strands of Barrier Breaking Grass to that sire when the auction ends.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why?” Zuo Mo raised her eyebrows in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shao Qing’s expression immediately turned gloomy. “Don’t care about the reason that much. Alright, continue hosting the auction!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, he left he room with a wave of his sleeve.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Mo bit her lips hatefully, “This really pisses me off!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>To nobody’s surprise, the Barrier Breaking Grass was no longer auctioned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noticing that, the bearded man beside Ye Zichen couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows, “Bro the Barrier Breaking Grass is in your hands, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s a secret!” Ye Zichen smiled, while he replied with a joyous tone. All he had to do to get the Barrier Breaking Grass was just to wait until the auction ends.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As time passed, the auction continued on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During this period of time, Ye Zichen, who had nothing better to do, calculated the transaction amount of the entire auction, and found that it really was as the bearded man said.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The amount truly surpassed ten billion.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>After the final item, the auction finally reached a close. Everyone waited for the staff to bring them their treasures, and that naturally included Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, at that very moment…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A huge hole suddenly appeared in the ceiling of the auction house.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zeze, this time… I seem to have caught a huge fish!”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Original Chapter Teaser:</strong>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p><strong>Shao Qing:&nbsp;</strong>Hmm... This is truly an exceptional pill. The effects of the pill are more than triple that of normal Spring-Returning Pills!</p>
 <p><b>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</b>Are you willing to buy these pills?</p>
 <p><strong>Zuo Liang:&nbsp;</strong>Sorry, but we are not going to...</p>
 <p><strong>Shao Qing:&nbsp;</strong>Yes, we'll buy however much you are willing to sell!</p>
 <p><strong>Zuo Liang:&nbsp;</strong>(whispers) But... my sister...</p>
 <p><strong>Shao Qing:&nbsp;</strong>(whispers) Young Lady Zuo Mo is acting like an idiot, are you going to as well? This Sprint-Returning Pill is almost five times as effective as normal ones. FIVE TIMES!</p>
 <p><strong>Zuo Liang:&nbsp;</strong>(whispers) But she said...</p>
 <p><strong>Shao Qing:&nbsp;</strong>(whispers) What's more, he might even have more extravagant pills! Think about the possibility! Don't just act like a child.</p>
 <p><strong>Zuo Liang:&nbsp;</strong>Mm, alright, I'll go and tell her right now.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>So you guys accepting it all?</p>
 <p><strong>Shao Qing:&nbsp;</strong>Of course. Do you have any other pills you wish to get appraised to sell as well? I can appraise them right now!</p>
