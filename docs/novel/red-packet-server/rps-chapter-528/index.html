 <p><span style>Chapter 528 – The First Girl Band</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bet? What do you want to be?” The Jade Emperor smiled. At that moment, he was indeed rather interested. The entertainment in the Heavenly Court had indeed been essentially the same for several hundreds of thousands of years. He was actually a bit sick of the songs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Postpone their punishment for now. Give me half a month’s time, and I’ll give you a visual feast that will alter your perception of entertainment. If I manage to do that, then let them go. If I don’t, then I will be punished alongside them,” Ye Zichen squinted his eyes and replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Jade Emperor nodded with a smile, “Alright, then this emperor will make this bet with you. If this emperor loses, then not only will I not punish them, I will reward you greatly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yet during this two weeks, I will require Jade Emperor to provide me with some assistance.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just tell me directly what you need.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then this little one will thank Jade Emperor first,” Ye Zichen bowed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jade Emperor raised his eyebrows, “Are you not afraid of losing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lose? It’s impossible for me to lose!” Ye Zichen replied with absolute certainty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>After everyone left the Cloudy Palace of the Golden Arches, God of Fortune and Leizhenzi both fixed their gazes on Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you two looking at me like this? What? Do you feel like you lost something by calling me Sky Sovereign since my cultivation isn’t that high?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, no!” Leizhenzi quickly denied it. “I definitely don’t mean that. It’s just that… Just now, there was no need for you to act like that in the palace.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah!” God of Fortune couldn’t help but nod. “The Jade Emperor was merely punishing us for our wrong doing. There is no need for you to be dragged in.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s alright!” Ye Zichen waved his hand with a smile. Some time ago, a certain girl band was extremely popular, and he did have a lot of their videos saved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, then can you tell us bros how you’re going to deal with it?” Canopy Marshal couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked over with a smile, “It’s a secret!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After that, Ye Zichen decided to stay in Yang Jian’s manor. Meanwhile, the major news of Sky Sovereign Nameless arriving in the Heavenly Court swept through the numerous deities.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the following three days, Immortal Lady He and Han Xiangzi were the first to visit alongside the Eight Immortals. Then, Yue Lao, Immortality Peach Fairy, Third Prince Nezha and co. also came over to visit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It could be said that Ye Zichen continuously greeted deities wave after wave, causing him to be unable to do anything else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, what surprised everyone was that Chang’e did not appear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kid, don’t be too outrageous,” the Jade Emperor knitted his eyebrows in the Cloudy Palace of the Golden Arches.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stood within the palace and smiled, “I wonder how this one is too outrageous?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are plenty of fairies in the Heavenly Court. Why did you set your eyes on my seven daughters? Just what exactly do you want?” The Jade Emperor said angrily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just moments prior, Ye Zichen went over to the Cloudy Palace of the Golden Arches to discuss further about the bet, but to the Jade Emperor’s surprise, Ye Zichen actually asked for his seven daughters…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Seven Fairies are natural beauties. Since it’ll be a visual feast, then the first impression definitely has to pass. Otherwise, if I find a bunch of normal looking people, no matter how amazing the show is, it’ll be pointless!” Ye Zichen shrugged. “What’s more, I seem to recall you promised me in the Cloudy Palace of the Golden Arches, and in the exact position that you’re in now, that you will satisfy any of my requests. You can’t be thinking of going back on your words, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, this emperor’s words are absolute. How could I go back on them?” The Jade Emperor snorted in response to Ye Zichen’s mockery, then called to the attendants outside the palace. “Summon the Seven Fairies!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Approximately ten-odd minutes later, the Seven Fairies arrived in the palace playfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Seven Fairies looked nearly identical, and the only way to tell them apart seemed to be the color of their clothes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Out of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet colored clothes, the fairy in the red dress was the eldest, while the purple was the youngest Seventh Fairy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Father, I wonder what business did you summon us, your daughters for?” The eldest fairy asked with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not the one who called for you, it was him!” Jade Emperor pointed at Ye Zichen, causing the Seven Fairies to look over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Seven fairy-jiejie, this man hereby greets you!” Ye Zichen smiled like a scholar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jade Emperor couldn’t help but frown when he saw that, “I didn’t tell you to come here to chat up my daughters. Tell them about the proper business already!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ai, alright,” Ye Zichen nodded with a smile, then walked in front of the Seven Fairies. “The situation is like this, since it’s all too complicated to tell you girls in detail, I’ll put it simply. You all belong to me now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?” The Seven Fairies all blushed together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you mean belong to you!?” Jade Emperor grasped the sides of his throne in anger. “Explain your words properly. This is the Heavenly Court after all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled coyly when he felt the sinister aura from behind him, “Ahem.. It’s like this. Your daddy got sick of fairies dancing, so he wants something more exciting. In order to satisfy his needs, I sought you guys out. I believe your father-daughter relationship will be able to satisfy his twisted mind.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brat…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen patted his chest after hurrying back to Yang Jian’s manner. Although the Jade Emperor normally gets bullied by a monkey, Ye Zichen could clearly feel that he was actually a lot stronger than the monkey.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, what exactly do you want us to do?” The Seven Fairies couldn’t help but ask. Just a while earlier, Ye Zichen had ran with all of them when their father became angry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, they all followed him willingly without any refusal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m going to get a girl band to start in the Heavenly Court. As for what a girl band is, it’s basically… Never mind, you won’t understand even if I explain it to you,” Ye Zichen shook his head and took out his phone, then clicked on one of the videos. “Here, take a look. This is a girl band…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Seven Fairies leaned over, but after they took one look, they could no longer look away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After letting them watch nearly ten videos, Ye Zichen put his phone away and looked at the fairies…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ll be like them in the future!” Third Fairy said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Their melody is so nice!” Fifth Fairy also smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I feel like their dance is so good, but I feel like it’s kind of embarrassing,” Sixth Fairy covered her blushing face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You feel like it’s embarrassing mostly because the Heavenly Court’s mindsets old fashioned. I haven’t shown you anything more embarrassing…” Ye Zichen twitched his mouth. </span><i><span style>I seem to recall I still have several Sola-sensei’s</span></i><span style><span><a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> </span></span><i><span style>combat videos. If I play those…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ahem, as a proper person. I will not teach bad things to these flower-like fairies.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You saw it just now, that’s what the girl band want to establish is. In the future, you need to quickly learn their dances and songs… Of course, I can promise you that if you learn it successfully, you will be the center of attention of everyone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really?” The eyes of the fairies lit up. </span><i><span style>Ahh, all girls have at least dreamed of becoming a celebrity…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course. Judging from your expressions, I guess you agree to establishing a girl band. Then what we have to do now is… practice!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen used his spiritual energy to charge his phone, then used a technique to project the screen into the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heavenly Court’s First Girl Band. Let’s begin!”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Original Chapter Teaser:</strong>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p><b>Jade Emperor:&nbsp;</b>Bet? What sort of bet do you want to make?</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>One about entertainment.</p>
 <p><strong>Jade Emperor:&nbsp;</strong>Ho? Elaborate.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>As I said before, the Heavenly Court is rather lacking in entertainment, so allow me to present to you something completely new and refreshing.</p>
 <p><strong>Jade Emperor:&nbsp;</strong>And that is?</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>A show. It will be a show like no other. It will be a show filled with dreams, and love. A show that will mesmerize everyone. It shall be a show that will change your view on entertainment completely!</p>
 <p><strong>Jade Emperor:&nbsp;</strong>Ahaha! That's some bold words you spoke. If you are sure about it, then tell me the terms that you want.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>I don't want much, it'll just be a bet on their punishments.</p>
 <p><strong>Jade Emperor:&nbsp;</strong>Fair enough. Is that all?</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>No, I also want to borrow your daughters.</p>
