 <p><span style>Chapter 23 – Picking up a dog from leftovers</span></p>
 <p><span style>While the professor continuously spoke at the front of the room, Ye Zichen slept at the back of the classroom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There really was no helping it. He was going to sleep the previous night, but the animals in his room had dragged him off to a network café near school to play an entire night of games.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To be honest, he was rather energetic while he was playing, but the sleepiness instantly came when he arrived at school.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a sleep that lasted for the entire morning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Ye Zichen was sleeping soundly, he felt someone carefully nudge his arm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen blurrily opened his eyes, and saw a girl that could barely get an eighty standing quietly beside him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re looking for me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen didn’t think that he knew this girl, but the girl nodded with certainty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I…” A faint blush appeared on the girl’s face. “Can I have lunch with you?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>A girl was asking him out!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was very confused!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This sort of situation has never appeared before. All of a sudden, Ye Zichen was actually unsure of how to reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, Riche Bro has a date at noon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The weird Xia Keke popped out from somewhere and immediately hugged Ye Zichen’s arm, then blinked towards the girl with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then at night…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Night time is no good either, Riche Bro has a date at night.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The girl bit her lips and stared at Xia Keke before running away from the classroom. Meanwhile, Ye Zichen looked at the arm that Xia Keke had been hugging awkwardly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Don’t think that Xia Keke was just a loli due to her face, she developed very well in the areas that should be developed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She wore rather little during the summer, so Ye Zichen was able to clearly see the outline of Xia Keke’s chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Riche Bro, you’re really popular recently,” Xia Keke acted like there was no one else as she chatted while hugging his arm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shouldn’t you let go?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen glared at her. A hint of craftiness flashed across Xia Keke’s eye, then she rubbed really hard before letting go.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This damn girlie.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen swore silently in her heart, he shamelessly had a reaction due to her action just now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Riche Bro, it’s no good as a man if you don’t have self-control.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s expression darkened upon hearing that. </span><i><span style>If it wasn’t because you teased me, would I have reacted like that?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes at Xia Keke and said unhappily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did find me for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, Riche Bro is so petty, I’m just kidding!” Xia Keke smiled, then crossed her arms and said, while dipping her head, “I want to treat Riche Bro to lunch, I wonder if Riche Bro will give me the honor…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Say the truth…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t roll his eyes anymore. When Xia Keke noticed that she couldn’t trick him, she could only twitch her mouth with boredom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“An old uncle wants to pay to date me. I told that guy that I have a boyfriend, but he didn’t believe it. So, help me pretend.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pay to date you? How much?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Riche Bro, that isn’t the point, okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke revealed an expression of helplessness, causing Ye Zichen to quickly apologize.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry, sorry. But, just how much did the old uncle want to pay? I’m just curious about how much you’re worth!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How much would you pay if it was you?” Xia Keke revealed a cute expression once again, causing Ye Zichen to shutter. At the same time, he rasied two fingers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Two hundred thousand?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ugh</span></i><span style>.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nearly spit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Twenty, no more than that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go and die.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Ye Zichen was unable to put up with this girl’s begging, Ye Zichen ended up going with her to a coffee shop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How much longer is he going to take?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen asked as he looked at the WeChat group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The WeChat group seemed to fallen into a quiet phase. The time of the last message sent was 10 in the morning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen scrolled up, and saw that three deities had sent red packets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen habitually clicked all of the red packets. Although he knew that there definitely wasn’t any left at the moment, he was still willing to do it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He might get some leftovers!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Speaking of which, Ye Zichen really did get one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received Howling Celestial Dog’s red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen saw that he could still get a red packet, his heart beat wildly, but when he saw that it was from the Howling Celestial Dog…</span></p>
 <p><span style>No wonder no one wanted it, a dog sent it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Eliminated Dog from the Celestial Dog Show x1</span></p>
 <p><span style>F*ck, eliminated!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s was face nearly covered in distaste.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Should be quick. He said he was on his way when I called him just now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Keke was clearly not interested in that uncle. She held her head with her hands and blinked, while starting straight at Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who was just about to check his friend’s statuses, felt the gaze from opposite him. He subconsciously gulped, then put his phone away and backed away a bit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What! What’s with your gaze?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m just curious, why would Susu like someone like you? You aren’t really handsome, and don’t seem to be really rich. You seem to be trash at academics as well, why is it that I can’t see your good points?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke tiled her head and looked at Ye Zichen curiously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen knew that Xia Keke couldn’t say anything good, so he just ignored the second half of what Xia Keke said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You said Su Yan likes me? She told you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t think too much, I’m just speculating,” Xia Keke rolled her eyes at Ye Zichen. “I just noticed that Susu has never went out with any guy, then you suddenly popped up, so I got curious.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at her with an expression of despise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh yeah, why didn’t you just find a boyfriend? What’s me pretending supposed to be?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If I find a boyfriend, then I have to find one who’s better than me at League.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t that simple?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shrugged, most of the girls playing League were in Silver or Gold, it’s really hard to find one in Platinum or Diamond.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were so many talented people in Polytechnic University, it was all too simple to find one who was Diamond or above.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Easy? This girl is Master on Ionia, okay?” Xia Keke raised her delicate chin and said coquettishly. “There hasn’t been any that could pique this lady’s interest in Polytechnic University.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen instantly spaced out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked at Xia Keke like he was looking at a monster.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Master.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And it was such a pretty girl.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What rank are you?” Seeing Ye Zichen’s shocked expression, Xia Keke felt an indescribable pride.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gold,” Ye Zichen answered honestly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Noob. When this lady is in a good mood, I’ll help you climb. Boy, you can only get girls if your rank is high!” Xia Keke patted Ye Zichen’s shoulders a few times like an older brother, causing him to be unable help but smile wryly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then carry me tonight!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, I’m not in the mood recently. I got wrecked yesterday, so I have to relax.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Xia Keke mentioned that, she revealed an expression of depression. Ye Zichen couldn’t help but snicker when he saw that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Girls were moody, the people they meet in Master were definitely people around the same skill level, isn’t it normal to get wrecked?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as he wanted to say a few words to comfort her, Ye Zichen saw the corner of Xia Keke’s lips raise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Riche Bro, he’s here. Don’t give it away later, 'kay?”</span></p>
