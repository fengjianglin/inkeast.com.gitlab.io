 <p><span style>Chapter 715 – Prepare for a Beatdown</span></p>
 <p><span style>Spiritual energy seemed to spread throughout the Three Realms. Black Dragon, whose cultivation level had stopped increasing for tens of thousands of years, suddenly felt a small increase in his cultivation level.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s definitely the real ley line.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>That was when Black Dragon realized. Ye Zichen studied the dragon race’s secret manual.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Did he fool me?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Although he didn’t want to admit it being the ruler of the demons, the truth was already in front of his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, he could only unleash his fury onto Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You dared to fool me!?” Black Dragon did not suppress the spiritual energy in his body in his fit of rage, causing it to harm his subordinates as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows when he felt the commotion in the mirage formation.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Oh wow, he really isn’t the head of the demons for nothing.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, despite thinking that, Ye Zichen naturally had to continue trash talking. “So how is it my fault that you’re not smart enough? Do you really think everybody is as much of a fool as you are? Do you think I didn’t know that you’ve got spies watching us? Did you really think that I would just stroll over so openly to retrieve the ley line? Damn, can you stop showing off how poor your intelligence is?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen opened his mouth in exaggeration even though Black Dragon could not see his exaggerated expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen did everything he could to exaggerate his tone to make Black Dragon imagine it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Creak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon grit his teeth. The cities were taken and the news on the ley line was false.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He could not accept this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, as expected of the Yellow Emperor’s reincarnation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Listen to what you’re saying. What does being the reincarnation of the Yellow Emperor have to do with anything? Your brain’s seriously offline!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You better maintain this mirage formation forever.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Or else?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You should understand,” Black Dragon clenched his teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, this sort of baseless threat was just like a kid saying some tough words. It was only childish.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen carefreely leaned back on a boulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, at that moment…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can’t hold it anymore!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty Yin, who was maintaining the mirage formation blurted out. He was indeed someone from the God Realm and was indeed of the Earth Supreme level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it took a huge amount of spiritual energy to activate the Eight Formations Origin Chart and also maintain the mirage formation to trap the demon experts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even a Sky Supreme’s spiritual energy would run dry sooner or later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Fatty Yin blurted that out, he stopped supplying the Eight Formation Origin Chart with spiritual energy and without any spiritual energy supply, the formation naturally stopped functioning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fatty, you can’t screw me over like this!” Ye Zichen’s eyes twitched.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The mists in the formation begun to disperse, while Black Dragon and co. also gradually regained the actual distance they could detect with their spiritual consciousness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Black Dragon wanted to laugh out loud.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Yes, this is it.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>This was what I was waiting for!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“It has finally arrived,” Black Dragon, who slowly walked out of the mist, had a terrifying expression on his face. He looked forwards and found his gaze landing on Ye Zichen, who was racing towards the interior of the valley. “Running away? It’s too late!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon’s right foot released a faint bit of spiritual energy as he kicked off the ground, leaving a huge hole behind. Then, he shot out in a flash of light towards Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All he wanted to do was to unleash his fury and Ye Zichen was his sole target.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Running towards the interior of the valley? Are you lost?” Black Dragon couldn’t help but mock as he quickly closed the distance between him and his prey. In less than a few breaths’ worth of time, the distance between them had decreased to around a dozen meters or so.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, Ye Zichen suddenly stopped, causing Black Dragon to abruptly come to a halt.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He’s seriously crafty. There’s definitely something wrong for him to stop here.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did you stop as well? Didn’t you want to kill me just now? I’m standing here now, why aren’t you coming over?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>There’s definitely something wrong...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon was even more certain of there being something amiss when he saw the fearless smile on Ye Zichen’s face.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>But where?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon looked around vigilantly and scanned everything in his surroundings.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Crap.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, he remembered that someone had gone to retrieve the ley line. </span><i><span style>Ye Zichen’s definitely buying time so that his people can take the ley line away.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I won’t allow that to happen.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon turned around and ran without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What? How did he notice?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen scratched his head in confusion when Black Dragon turned around. </span><i><span style>He shouldn’t have been able to notice!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Lorie, do it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Got it,” a childish voice rang out from near the wall of the valley. Then, a pretty figure came out of a crack in the valley and punched.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon instinctively raised his right arm and blocked Lorie’s attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even with Black Dragon’s strength and his constitution as a demon, he still couldn’t help but exclaim when he took the punch.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This little girl’s strength…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is extraordinarily strong.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>This will be troublesome. </span></i><span style>Black Dragon looked intently at the two people in front of him. He didn’t choose to break through immediately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So time began to tick away…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This is strange, why aren’t the others here yet?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Although he didn’t wait for his subordinates earlier, they should have already caught up in his opinion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen could guess what Black Dragon was waiting for as he saw the latter’s shifting gaze. He couldn’t help but twitch his mouth, “You waiting for your guys to come over? They probably can’t.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?” Black Dragon raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Can’t?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>The only one left over there just now was a fatty without any spiritual energy. Did he have other helpers just now?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>The demon sovereigns are at the peak of the Demon Realm. The Three Realms will need plenty of elites to block them all.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But, if they were to send elites to attack us, then the cities couldn’t have fallen that easily…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What did I miss?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Was that fatty pretending to be out of spiritual energy? No, that’s impossible, a spiritual energy exhaustion is not something that you can just act out.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon didn’t understand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn’t expect you to bring so many people as well.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That’s the only explanation. </span></i><span style>Black Dragon snorted with a dark look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen merely shrugged, “You blind? There’s only the three of us on my side. Can you not count?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can’t be trying to tell me that the fatty made all my demon elites stay behind?” asked Black Dragon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh,” Black Dragon naturally did not believe Ye Zichen. However, he was in no mood to argue, he merely glanced at Ye Zichen and Lorie plainly. “So, the two of you are going to hold me back?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon was willing to admit that Lorie was a bit of a threat, but only a little bit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shrugged. “Mhmm, prepare yourself for a beatdown.”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Original Chapter Teaser:</strong>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p><b>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</b>You're a bad guy, I'm a good guy. What do you think? Did you think that we were besties or something? Sorry, but I don't have a bestie with such an edgy name. You might as well have named yourself edgelord.</p>
 <p><strong>Black Dragon:&nbsp;</strong>You dare!?</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Lorie, time to get to work. Let's give our&nbsp;friends a warm welcome.</p>
 <p><strong>Lorie:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, sir!</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>See? That's a good girl. Totally unlike you, Mr. iamsoedgy. You aren't a good boy at all. Time for us to give you a good spanking!</p>
