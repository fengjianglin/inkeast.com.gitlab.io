 <p><span style>Chapter 449 – The Three Realms Sends Their Troops</span></p>
 <p><span style>An alluring moan sounded out amidst the sea of purple energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A naked woman laid on the ground, while a bronze-skinned man laid on top of her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She continuously worked with the man and tried her best to satisfy the man’s every request.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So that she could live.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A fiery blame landed from the sky and pierced the man’s body. At the very moment the woman thought that she was saved…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fiery blade exploded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t want to die!” the woman screamed, but after being engulfed by the flames, the only thing left behind was ashes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Ye Zichen’s heart had already turned numb, he had already witnessed countless normal people die due to the repercussions of the flames.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, he had also witnessed the ugliest parts of humanity in a short half an hour.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry up and run….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A couple held each others’ hands as they ran on the street, while being chased by slime-spitting reptilian monsters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha’er!” Just as they were about to turn the corner, they noticed that the street they were about to run onto were also filled with low leveled demons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They tried to take a step back, but they had nowhere to go.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hubby….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wifey, do you love me?” the man suddenly looked at the woman beside him solemnly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman was stunned for a brief moment before she nodded, “I do…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe… Then die for me!” the man’s expression turned menacing. He pushed the woman into the swarm of abyssals, while he ran towards the nearby greenery. “I want to live, I want to live…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the woman, who was pushed into the swarm of abyssals, was bitten to death, the man who discarded his wife continued to run forward!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I hate men like you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as the man felt a hint of relief since he managed to escape, a voluptuous woman with slightly dark skin appeared in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman had grey irises, and pink hair, while she wore a light red robe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck off!” There were no abyssals on the street he was on, so the man, who had only just escaped death, knitted his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He lifted his hand and tried to push the woman…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman twisted it off, then carried him by the collar, and flew over to the place where the man’s wife died.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Die with her!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She tossed the man into the abyssal swarm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment the man landed, the low leveled abyssals who had been waiting there instantly charged over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman listened to the man’s endless screams until he was unable to utter anything anymore. Then, she looked up at Ye Zichen, who was using Xuan-Yuan Sword to kill demons…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yellow Emperor? It seems like he’s the only one who’s more fun here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since there were too many demons, even Ye Zichen, who had Xuan-Yuan Sword, only had a tiny amount of affect. He was even unable to find where Wei Chen and co. was. However, he believed that those people would definitely be fighting on the front line.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He held his phone tightly in his hand, while he handed the control of Xuan-Yuan Sword over to Xuan-Yuan Xiang completely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Ye Zichen repeatedly contacted Yang Jian, the Great Sage and co….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“@Erlang Shen @Monkey King @Third Prince Nezha!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: What is it?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: What business do you have with me, Old Sun?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha: Sky Sovereign, I’m playing ball.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Sky Sovereign actually mentioned the three of them. Why do I have a foreboding feeling?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mother of Lightning: ^</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Fortune: ^^</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, the atmosphere in the group became very intense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Due to being short on time, Ye Zichen also chose to directly send a voice message in the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Demons are attacking the Modern Realm. Requesting backup!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s voice rang out through the entire Heavenly Court the moment the message was sent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the Heavenly Court deities in the Red Packet Server looked up into the sky, while the Jade Emperor, Queen Mother, the Three Pure Ones etc. also looked up.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Laws of the World.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just who is actually able to use the Laws of the World? </span></i><span style>All of a sudden, the Jade Emperor and co. all begun to make incantation sigils to find out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Yang Jian and co. knew that it was definitely Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Wait a moment. I’m going to rally my troops immediately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: @Canopy Marshal, idiot, Old Sun’s going to wait for you at Mount Huaguo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: Understood. I’m going to get my rake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha: Sky Sovereign wait. Oh yeah, send me the command seal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen directly sent it over to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Nezha received it, he quickly replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, I’ll go over with big brother Yang Jiang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were the only ones who spoke up in the Heavenly Court, while the God of Thunder and the rest… knew that it was not a situation they should speak up recklessly in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Howling Celestial Dog!” The moment Yang Jian returned to his manor, he grabbed his command seal and shouted out in the courtyard. Not long later, a panting pug ran over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop being an idiot here. C’mon, to the South Heaven Gate!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoosh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Howling Celestial Dog instantly turned into a black-clothed young man and nodded. Yang Jian squinted his eyes and gripped the command seal in his hand…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everybody, listen. Gather at the South Heaven Gate!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Yang Jian arrived at the South Heaven Gate, he saw that Nezha was already fully armed and waiting for him along with his own eighty thousand Heavenly Soldiers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, Yang Jiang’s a hundred thousand Heavenly Soldiers also appeared at the South Heaven Gate…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gulp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The South Heaven Gate’s guard commander gulped. </span><i><span style>This… Are they going to war?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“True Lord Erlang, Third Prince Nezha, you guys…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop wasting my time. Move aside!” Yang Jian pushed him away, then turned towards the soldiers behind him. “Move out!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, the Great Sage was not standing idle at Mount Huaguo. At that moment, his several hundred thousand monkeys were already standing orderly and looking sharply ahead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha, the Three Realms have been peaceful for far too long. I, Old Sun, is taking you guys to fight this time, so hurry up, understand?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are we fighting the Heavenly Court?” One of the monkeys asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Great Sage instantly rolled his eyes, “What’s fun about that? I, Old Sun, is already bored of that. Now stop bullshitting and follow I, Old Sun!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Ye Zichen finally let out a sigh when he saw the three say that they were already on the move.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He put back his phone into his pocket and licked his lips. Just when he was about to start hunting abyssals with Xuan-Yuan Xiang once again, he heard a playful giggle behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You still have the urge to play with your phone right now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked back…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did Ye Zichen noticed that a woman had already silently appeared behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Demon!” Ye Zichen’s gaze sharpened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noticing that, Xuan-Yuan Xiang also hurried moved the Xuan-Yuan Sword over…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zeze, Xuan-Yuan Sword,” the alluring woman looked at the sword and raised her eyebrows. “as I expected. You… are the Yellow Emperor, right!?”</span></p>
