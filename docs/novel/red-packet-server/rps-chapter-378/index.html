 <p><span style>Chapter 378 – Don’t Use Him</span></p>
 <p><span style>Three days passed by in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The situation unfolded as Su Yiyun predicted, as the stock of Maintaining Beauty continued to rise during the three days, causing the company’s market worth to more than double itself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry, the comments on the internet affected you quite a lot, right?” Ye Zichen said apologetically while sitting on the sofa in Xiao Yumei’s office.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the past few days, she essentially did not leave her home at all since the entrance was continuously flooded with a group of journalists, and that situation only turned for the better today.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s there to be sorry about? I was just worried that talking would cause an unwanted impact. Otherwise, it isn’t a problem for me to admit that I’m your mistress. You aren’t actually married yet, so it’s not like I destroyed your family’s happiness. Just what sort of thing can those gossip tabloids makeup?” Xiao Yumei stood up from her chair with a smile and sat down next to Ye Zichen. She immediately kissed him on his cheeks. “But you, you managed to help our stock rise so much. What sort of reward do you want?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it was normally, Ye Zichen definitely would not be able to resist it when Xiao Yumei said something so seductive. However, he had been worried about things to do with the demon race for the past few days, so he was not in the mood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Give some money to the victims’ families. Even if it wasn’t my fault that Yao Yue murdered them, she wouldn’t have done it if that incident didn’t happen,” Ye Zichen signed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei pursed her lips and smiled, “My little man is truly kind. Although, you didn’t need to say that at all. I already have people on it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s for the best,” Ye Zichen smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two continued to chat for a while until it was lunch time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My little man, let’s go to dinner together. We haven’t ate together for so long.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s not too long, right?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows. “We ate together in the capital.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen wanted to hurry back to the mansion. Other people were unable to detect the demonic energy because it was too faint, but Lil’ White could sense it, and he had spent the last three days tracking it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen wanted to go back to the mansion to ask Lil’ White about how the tracking is going.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I said it’s been ages, so it is. Are you going or not?” Xiao Yumei said with her hands on her hips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, Ye Zichen immediately shrugged and gave in, “I’m going, I’m going, okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Humph!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did Xiao Yumei smile proudly as she wrapped her arm around Ye Zichen’s and left the building.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To be frank, Ye Zichen did not know why the women around him all liked to eat foreign food. From his perspective, it was nowhere as cost efficient as random stews…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The place where Xiao Yumei took him was a new Thai restaurant. Since Ye Zichen was completely clueless when it came to Thai food, he naturally handed the task of ordering to Huge Beauty Xiao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? Can you be happier when eating with me?” Xiao Yumei couldn’t help but say after ordering when she noticed that Ye Zichen’s eyebrows were still knitted closely together. That was how he has been ever since they left the company.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m just thinking, there’s been too many things annoying me recently,” Ye Zichen replied apologetically.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei immediately twitched her mouth and held out out-stretched hand, “Don’t pressure yourself too much. You aren’t Christ, understood?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm,” Ye Zichen nodded with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, an angry roar sounded out in the restaurant, “Waiter, waiter… Just what kind of shitty store is this place?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A waiter quickly ran over, and asked questioningly with his hands at his side, “Sir, is there anything about our restaurant that’s not to your liking?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I heard that your restaurant manager wants this restaurant to be for the elite only. Normal people can’t even get in, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That is the case, sir,” the waiter nodded in confirmation. “Our restaurant is made for elites .The only people that can enter are all elites of a certain field.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what about their table?” The man pointed at Ye Zichen’s table with a frown and cursed. “I don’t feel any kind of the aura of an elite from their table. That is clearly just a rich man’s mistress and her sugar baby.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The waiter’s expression drastically changed. Many people in the surrounding area looked over at Ye Zichen’s table, but were completely shocked when they saw the people at the table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Seriously…” Ye Zichen shook his head with a wry smile. </span><i><span style>Why is there so much trouble when we only came out to eat?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you spacing out for? I request you to kick those two out. They are severely affecting my appetite. I have a guest coming later, so what is this supposed to be?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Song An, you just like to seek thrills so much?" Ye Zichen, who didn’t want the trouble, stood up and walked in front of Song An with a mocking laugh. “What? Did I not teach you enough of a lesson on the plane?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, it’s junior!” Song An immediately smiled in surprise when he saw Ye Zichen. “I didn’t see your figure clearly from the back. I definitely would not have said that if I knew it was junior. Sorry, sorry!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, did you know that you’re sick?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm?” Song An did not catch his drift.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pointed his finger at Song An’s head. “Brain damage!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Say that again!?” Song An’s expression immediately turned cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment, the door of the restaurant was pushed open. Deng Cheng and Liu Qianqian walked in side by side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Elder Deng!” Song An immediately hid the gloominess of his face, and walked over with a warm smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Song An, you actually remembered to come back to work in our nation after studying in the US for so long. Not bad!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is what I should do,” Song An nodded with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Deng Cheng smiled in satisfaction, then noticed Ye Zichen, who was standing beside Song An. “Lil’ Ye is here as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gramps, your eyesight is just… I’m standing right here, can you not be so surprised?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Deng Cheng immediately chuckled, “I’m old, so my eyesight is naturally not as good. Isn’t it normal for me not to have seen you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Song An couldn’t help but interrupt with a frown when he noticed that the two people in front of him chatted more and more, “Elder Deng, you and this little… junior know each other?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Naturally. Song An, let me introduce you. This person is called Ye Zichen. His medical skills are amazing, and even I have to learn from him,” Deng Cheng smiled humbly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Song An’s expression turned for the worse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noticing that, Deng Cheng was rather surprised.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Ye Zichen also chuckled, “Gramps, you can’t have been invited here by Song An, right? He wants to be a doctor at your hospital?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah!” Deng Cheng nodded. However, he couldn’t help but ask when he noticed Ye Zichen’s meaningful smile. “What is it? Is there any problem?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Problem?” Ye Zichen suddenly snickered. “It’s a huge problem, but I don’t want to be so blunt, since I do have to leave some face for your Master Song. However, I do have to remind you… It would be better if your hospital doesn’t accept him!”</span></p>
