 <p><span style>Chapter 632 – Battling Youmuu</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Twin swords.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had no idea why the pair of swords appeared as opposed to the blood scythe. But regardless, they still looked pretty cool.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He flapped his wings and rose into the sky and looked down upon the others. “Doesn’t the Mu family want to get even? I’ll give you the chance to do it now. Come!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t even think about acting out of line here,” at that moment, someone shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, an old man with a hooked nose appeared.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Mid-stage Sky Immortal.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Bang. Bang. Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was able to knock the old man onto the ground in a few mere moments. </span><i><span style>Seriously, these Sky Immortal experts in the outer section of the Immortal Region seems to be ridiculously weak.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>When compared to the Heavenly Court…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Perhaps even complete stage Human Immortal Heavenly Soldiers would be able to beat the crap out of them.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Who’s next?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let me test him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang. Bang. Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The following person was knocked onto the ground in less than a minute.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Next!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regardless of who the Mu family sent to face him and how strong they were supposed to be, ye Zichen were able to easily defeat them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In all honesty, even Ye Zichen felt like it was a little surreal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wasn’t actually so strong before, but ever since he learnt the spiritual techniques the white-robed man taught him and after he broke through into the Sky Immortal level…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He really was super strong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was able to beat up anyone he faced unmatched.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, nobody from the Mu family dared to face him anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stood in the air cockily and looked indifferently at the people below. Then, he curled his lips and hooked his fingers at Mu Chengtian, “The one chosen by the Six Realms Patroller. Come… I do want to test him myself. The Six Realms Patroller’s criteria seem rather low now since even sickly bastards can get chosen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t you know whether my criteria are low or not?” With a flash of golden light, a man in a police uniform and wearing an eyepatch on his left eye slowly walked towards Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lord Patroller, please gain justice for us!” Mu Cheng greeted the incomer subserviently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man ignored him and merely walked in front of Ye Zichen. “Long time no see.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Youmuu, it really was you. But seriously, you’ve got a rather horrible fetish. You’re still wearing this after so long. Is your company not giving you any new work clothes?” Ye Zichen squinted his eyes and mocked him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youmuu smiled. However, his expression instantly darkened moments later, “Demon, you seem stronger. Six wings… I wonder how strong you are now. You actually dare to speak to me like that!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately focused on a defensive spiritual technique, while the Swirling Flash Plate also shimmered on his body the moment Youmuu glared at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Umph,” Ye Zichen grunted while he slid back a hundred meters or so even when he crossed his swords in front of him to defend against the attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen,” Zuo Mo called out worriedly.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He seemed so strong just now, but this person actually dominated him.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is the Six Realms Patroller this strong?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, you actually dared to oppose Lord Patroller. You’re just asking for it,” Mu Cheng revealed an expression of disdain. “it seems like our Mu family doesn’t need to do anything. Lord Patroller will deal with this trouble for us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, no wonder this brat has wings. Didn’t you hear Lord Patroller? He’s a demon!” Zuo Hongxin laughed coldly. “Zuo Hongde, just look at what sort of people your daughter knows!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>While the people on the ground discussed away, Youmuu stopped his attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You actually managed to block off my attack using ten percent of my strength. I wonder if you can…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A creamy white sphere of light appeared in his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s eyes twitched. This was his first time seeing Youmuu use a spiritual technique.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although this attack was definitely going to be a lot stronger than Youmuu’s barehanded strike, Ye Zichen still smirked.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Back in the Modern Realm, I was completely helpless…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>At least, I can now force Youmuu to use spiritual techniques.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You can still laugh? If I was you, I would have fled already.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why should I flee? Youmuu, you are a target that I aimed to defeat,” clear excitement could be seen in Ye Zichen’s expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youmuu snorted, “You, defeat me? You’re not worthy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sphere of light in his hands shot out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s eyes twitched once more as he crossed his swords again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He coughed up a mouthful of blood. As his blood fell on top of his pair of swords, they seemed to become more crystallized. His body wobbled for a moment, but he managed to calm his body down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha… Ahahaha…” Ye Zichen laughed loudly with the side of his mouth covered in his own blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was when Youmuu squinted his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He’s actually still alive.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Die!” Youmuu pushed off the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen also stopped laughing and chuckled as he saw Youmuu’s sinister look, “You’re finally going to use your real strength? I’m very sorry, but I’m not a target dummy…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen combined his two long swords, forming a new broadsword in his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sword was two meters long and half a meter wide. There was a dragon of blood coiled around the blade itself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen gripped the sword with his two hands, causing the veins on both of his arms to surface.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His eyes also turned pitch black, while the feathers of his wings glistened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he flapped his wings, feathers continuously fell from it, but for some reason, the number of feathers on his wings did not decrease at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Die demon!” A delicate dagger appeared in Youmuu’s hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen hacked down at Youmuu with a stern look on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rampaging spiritual energy radiated outwards, and tears in the space itself actually began to appear due to the strength of their spiritual energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t get so full of yourself. The people behind you have been working hard to catch up!” Ye Zichen shouted as his broadsword cracked Youmuu’s dagger and sent the latter flying back by some ten-odd meters. “Come!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I-I was actually knocked back,” Youmuu glanced at Ye Zichen in complete surprise.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I’m the Six Realms Patroller. I was actually knocked back by a mere mortal.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Impossible!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A raging aura was released from Youmuu’s body. A large hole gradually appeared on his forehead which seemed to suck in black spiritual energy from the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon, the entire area had turned black.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, Ye Zichen responded by increasing the crimson energy around him which now contained faint traces of darkness within.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Approximately two and a half minutes later, Youmuu cut off his connection with the black energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was now clad with a black crystal armor. His pale blue hair now reached his face, and the eyepatch which covered his eyes were gone. What replaced it was…</span></p>
 <p><span style>A sapphire-like eye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Very good. You actually made me use seventy percent of my strength. Now, die!”</span></p>
