 <p><span style>Chapter 755 – The Jade Emperor Ascends</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen laid down within a celestial manor and played with his phone and on the screen was his chat with the Jade Emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had already accepted the red packet and discovered two hundred thousand Reputation within.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did you give me all that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen thought back to when he opened the red packet. His expression had been filled with disbelief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reputation!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two hundred thousand Reputation!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Weren’t you exchanging Reputation with the deities? I don’t like paying attention to all that, but it doesn’t mean that I’m clueless.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Jade Emperor had answered with a carefree smile, “I’ll be waiting for you in the God Realm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shook his head when he thought back to how free the Jade Emperor looked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And now, he finally understands what Reputation is used for.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The amount of Reputation was what helped to determine the victor of the Struggle for the Three Realms. In fact, the ones with the highest Reputation in each realm would be that realm’s leader.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, the one with the highest Reputation had a chance to become the Master of the Three Realms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That naturally required the agreements of the other people on the Reputation leaderboard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was indeed trading for Reputation with the deities in the group, it was something the white-robed man told him to do, it was something he never forgot.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I thought I was secretive enough, I can’t believe he still ended up noticing.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>But what confused him was that the Jade Emperor actually handed all the latter’s Reputation to him. </span><i><span style>Why didn’t he hand it all to his successor?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Three Realms Reputation Leaderboard,” Ye Zichen summoned the leaderboard quietly and saw that he was placed in second place with two hundred and ninety Reputation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That means that he only managed to muster up ninety thousand Reputation before receiving the Reputation from the Jade Emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He put it away again, then chuckled, “Ahh, I really don’t know what I should say.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>For beings like Ye Zichen, half a month passed by in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen remained in the Heavenly Court the entire time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was invited to watch the Jade Emperor’s ascension ceremony and the Jade Emperor also wanted to introduce the next master of the Heavenly Court to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The North Pole Emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was not surprised about this at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>If the Jade Emperor had to choose someone that all the deities would accept, he naturally had to choose someone else from the Six Sovereigns<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p><span style>The ascension of the Jade Emperor came so suddenly, so it had caught the deities in the Heavenly Court rather off guard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, ascension was a law of nature, even the Jade Emperor could not defy it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the South Heaven’s Gate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the place where the Jade Emperor chose to ascend.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The South heaven’s Gate was the first line of defense for the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He decided upon this spot to prevent a demonic surprise attack as most of the deities would be present.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, he was truly putting himself aside for this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If the demons cause some trouble, then it might actually affect his ascension.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the Jade Emperor still make this decision without any hesitation even after Ye Zichen informed him of the possibility.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was very clear that the Heavenly Court was the most important thing to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll leave this place to you now,” the Jade Emperor couldn’t help but say to the North Pole Emperor once again even though he was already certain that the North Pole Emperor would not disappoint him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Leave it to me,” the North Pole Emperor replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After getting his confirmation, the Jade Emperor turned back to his companions who have worked with him for countless years.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He smiled when he saw the longing looks on the deities’ faces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, he rested his gaze on Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t forget your promise.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded in response. No reply was as good as action.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then…</span></p>
 <p><span style>A ray of holy light shone down from the skies and fell upon the Jade Emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He pursed his lips with a smile, “It’s time. See you int eh God Realm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Jade Emperor’s body began to rise uncontrollably, the deities started to wave towards him until he finally disappeared from sight. Even then, they still refused to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Seven Fairies had also started to cry in a circle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They have never one separated from the Jade Emperor since he became a deity. Now that the Jade Emperor ascended, they must really miss him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I guess we won’t be seeing any of their concerts in the short run.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright everyone, ascending was the Jade Emperor’s wish of a lifetime. We should give him our blessing now that he has gotten his wish. He left this place to us before he left, so let us not disappoint him,” North Pole Emperor called out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other deities nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the ceremony ended, Ye Zichen and Flame Emperor refused North Pole Emperor’s invitation to stay and left the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Flame Emperor had a complicated expression on his face as they went away. It was filled with a bit of longing and a bit of loneliness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon, he sighed, “Jade Emperor really did ascend.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, we saw it with our very own owns. So, stop worrying now, he won’t be of any threat to the Immortal Region anymore,” Ye Zichen pursed his lips with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Flame Emperor merely shook his head in response, “I really don’t mind that anymore. I was just thinking, we will probably ascend in the future, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ve lived here for so long, then suddenly, we have to be in a completely foreign place. There are so many people we’ve been with over here as well. I really can’t imagine what it’ll be like.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Flame Emperor’s words made Ye Zichen think. </span><i><span style>What’ll it be like if I ascend?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>After a while, he could only smile, “Everything comes to an end, since we are cultivators, then we have to get used to saying goodbye. It’s a natural part of our lives. If possible, then we’ll just meet up again in the God Realm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s true.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the two of them returned to Maple City, Flame Emperor quickly took his leave because he had business to attend to in the Immortal Region.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen returned to the manor by himself and saw Stone pacing around anxiously with Xue Qi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened?” Ye Zichen walked towards the two.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing him, the two of them beamed, “You’re finally back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You were waiting for me?” Ye Zichen pointed at himself. Zuo Mo was the one who helped him manage everything, he was really happy about not having to actually do anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was able to deal with most situations and he wasn’t really of any help in the ones she couldn’t deal with.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just go and find Zuo Mo, why come to me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other two people shook their heads.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xue Qi said worriedly, “Something happened with Lady Zuo Mo!”</span></p>
