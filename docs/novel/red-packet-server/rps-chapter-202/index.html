 <p><span style>Chapter 202 – Erlang Shen, who’s no longer in poverty.</span></p>
 <p><span style> You received Erlang Shen’s red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gold Ingot x50</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cultivation experience x100000.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was shocked upon seeing that. </span><i><span style>What’s going on with Erlang Shen? Why did he send me so much in the red packet?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>50 gold ingots… That was five hundred thousand yuan.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>There was also the one hundred thousand cultivation experience…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is this still the Erlang Shen that I know?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, you got rich, ah?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sent a message in shock…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Hahaha, bro, I, your brother, finally managed to stand up on my own two feet!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: That Landlord game that you taught me is so goddamn amazing. I, your brother, have been slaughtering everyone in the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: I’m telling you, I, your brother, managed to stand up on my feet!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen could feel exactly just how excited Erlang Shen was from these words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To be honest, Ye Zichen was truly moved when he saw the reply.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Such a great bro.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>He still remembered to send me red packets even after earning so much, but I was only focused on benefits when I taught him the game.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, Ye Zichen sighed in his heart and shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, how about I teach you another way to earn money.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need, your bro, I, am earning happily with Landlord right now. When those guys in the Heavenly Court have more or less learned everything, then you can teach me something new so I can go slaughter them again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, it’s good that bro’s earning.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, that’s it. The geezer, Old Lord Taishang, is not happy with losing and asked me to keep playing, so I’ll leave now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your intimacy level with Erlang Shen increased by 200. Current intimacy level: 500.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck, an increase of 200 instantly. It seems like Erlang Shen has truly earned a lot in the Heavenly Court.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wait…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>He mentioned Old Lord Taishang just now.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Shushushu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen entered his chat with Erlang Shen, then started to spam him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen, who was about to begin playing, raised his hand to signal the others to wait a moment. This caused Old Lord Taishang and the God of Fortune to be rather displeased.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yang Jian, are you going to play or not?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, are you still playing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“One sec, my bro’s looking for me,” Erlang Shen crossed his legs, then replied to Ye Zichen’s message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, what is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You said that you’re playing Landlord with Old Lord Taishang, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen couldn’t help but chuckle when Old Lord Taishang was mentioned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That geezer had earned a lot by refining pills in the Heavenly Court. He was definitely one of the richest people in the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was stubborn, and would call to be Landlord no matter his cards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, he was also old, so he wasn’t the brightest person around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was the typical fool with a lot of money.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason Erlang Shen was able to get back on his feet so quick was mostly thanks to that geezer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, I have a request to ask of you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style> No need to ask, just say it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason he could get back on his feet was all thanks to Ye Zichen. In his mind, although Ye Zichen was a bro, he was more of a savior.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Play with Old Lord Taishang, and help me win a Three Striped Soul-Clearing Heaven-Returning Pill.”</span></p>
 <p><span style> “Pill? Sure, no problem, wait for the good news.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that as well as the urging from Old Lord Taishang and the God of Fortune, Erlang Shen let go of everything to “fight”.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled as he put his phone back into his pocket after getting Erlang Shen’s confirmation. However, he saw Mu Jinglei holding her head in her hands as she looked straight at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“… Sis, why are you looking at me like that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you hear me call you just now?” Mu Jinglei looked at him. “You were so focused when chatting with your girlfriend just then!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ugh.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Who the f*ck is my girlfriend!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked up speechlessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Mu Jinglei said with a shudder, “Could it be that it’s a boyfriend and not a girlfriend… Sigh, Zichen, that isn’t good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sis, enough!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He really didn’t think that Mu Jinglei was actually that kind of person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen?” At that moment, a slightly surprised voice sounded out at the stairway to the second floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Jinglei looked over, then saw an oily-faced man in a suit walking towards them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, he’s looking for you?” Mu Jinglei looked over at Ye Zichen as the oily-faced man arrived in front of their table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, it really is you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cui Xuan, long time no see.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stood up from the chair. This was his high school classmate. They weren’t on really good terms, but they weren’t on bad terms either. His family had a bit of money, and after graduation, he seemed to have gone with his dad to do business on the oceans.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They didn’t meet after that, so it was a surprise that they met here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I couldn’t tell, but you’re doing pretty good. You can actually come dine in these places now,” Cui Xuan patted his shoulder and laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen could only laugh dryly in response when he felt his ex-classmate’s intimacy, “I’m not bad.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is this your girlfriend?” Cui Xuan glanced towards Mu Jinglei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen quickly explained, “This is my sis, actually I can only come here because she’s treating me to a meal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, it’s like that... Ai, this you’re eating here too, I’m a Gold member here and is having a meal with an important person here. Don’t say that your old classmate isn’t taking care of you, let’s go together, I’ll introduce you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that really good?” Ye Zichen smiled wryly, he merely wanted to eat a meal here…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, to have this happen when Mu Jinglei was with him, that wasn’t good.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s wrong with that? You should still be in university, right? I’m telling you, you don’t know how hard it is in our society. That important person is around our age, knowing an extra person is an extra way out!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was unable to refuse when he saw that his old classmate was so passionate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He could only sigh in his heart, then turned around to look at Mu Jinglei, “Sis, what do you think?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then let’s go and take a look,” Mu Jinglei felt rather helpless as well. Since the other person has already said that, the two of them can’t really refuse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then, thank you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cui Xuan smiled on the way to the room, “Old classmate, what are you studying in uni?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Medicine!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Medicine’s good, being a doctor can earn you quite a bit of money. It’s not like me, I went to the oceans with my dad and earned several million in a few years, but my body isn’t well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I study veterinary medicine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A vet?” Cui Xuan frowned slightly. “That’s a bit worse since you’re not treating people, but it’s still alright. Animals are worth more than people these days.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s alright,” Ye Zichen didn’t know how to reply exactly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Eventually, Ye Zichen followed Cui Xuan to a room. Right before entering, Cui Xuan couldn’t help but to remind Ye Zichen, “Old classmate, don’t casually say things after entering… This is related to the financing of my new company.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood,” Ye Zichen nodded with a smile. Only then did Cui Xuan knock lightly on the door, then walked in respectfully with his hands by his side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Qu.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person that was witting on the sofa in the room was a young man of about twenty something years old. Ye Zichen looked over…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ugh.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Qu Yaoyang.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen wanted to leave subconsciously, but Qu Yaoyang had already started walking towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Qu, this is…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cui Xuan wanted to introduce Ye Zichen, but Qu Yaoyang ignored him and instead directly greeted Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Ye.”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Original Teaser: [expand]</strong></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>What is this madness? My bro in poverty actually sent me a red packet! Is he alright in the head?</p>
 <p><em>In the Heavenly Court, Erlang Shen sneezes.</em></p>
 <p><b>Erlang Shen:&nbsp;</b>Achoo! Who is speaking bad about me? Ugh. Whatever though, people don't seem to like me all that much right now...</p>
 <p><b>Old Lord Taishang:&nbsp;</b>Hurry up and play your cards!</p>
 <p><b>God of Fortune:&nbsp;</b>Yeah! Are you actually playing or not!?</p>
 <p><b>Erlang Shen:&nbsp;</b>Tsk, shut up, I just don't get it, why do the two of you want to lose so quickly? You've already lost so much gold ingots to me.</p>
 <p><strong>God of Fortune:&nbsp;</strong>Heh, I'm the God of Fortune, this much is nothing to me!</p>
