 <p><span style>Chapter 37 – Who’s hotter</span></p>
 <p><span style>After being with Lil’ White for around ten minutes, Ye Zichen finally understood why it had been eliminated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It’s too much of a tsundere!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This little fellow didn’t give face to its owner at all. It was clear that it was the supreme and unparalleled king in its world!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s fine if you’re like this with me. You have to act nice and cute when you see my mom later.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Disdain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you’re obedient, then I’ll bring you good food next time, it’s so much better than the food in the Heavenly Court.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ White’s eyes brightened and showed a hint of hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I swear!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised three fingers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ White checked Ye Zichen out meaningfully, then nodded like a human. At the same time, he reached out his paw for a high-five.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right before they got out of the car, Lil’ White looked at him vigilantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As if it was saying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Remember the good food!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed like Lil’ White is a little glutton.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go, that’s my mom.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen put Lil’ White onto the ground and indicated towards Ye Rong, who was in the pavilion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ White wagged its tail, indicating that it understood, then ran proudly over to Ye Rong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, what’s it called?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen walked over, Lil’ White and Ye Rong had already got familiar with each other. Yet, most importantly, Lil’ White actually winked at Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Ye Zichen watched the smile on Ye Rong, he also smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ White.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s so smart,” With a clap of Ye Rong’s hands, Lil’ White jumped into her arms and rubbed its head against her neck, asking to get spoiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at everything that was happening in front of him with a smile. Just at that moment, the phone in his pocket rang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen picked up the phone, then the corner of his mouth raised for some reason.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mom, I still have some other business, so I’ll be leaving first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where, you’re not eating dinner?” Although Ye Rong was playing very happily with Lil’ White, Ye Zichen was still the most important one in her heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nope, it’s rather urgent.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Without any other words, Ye Zichen drove to Golden Spring Hotel like a bolt of lightning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Room 415.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen pushed open the door, he saw the Dragonball fanatic, little yellow-hair, blanking out as he looked out the window.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You came,” Yellow-hair suddenly stood up. Ye Zichen indicated that he didn’t need to do so, then sat down on a chair. He raised his eyebrows and asked, “Fu Chengming is in the opposite room?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, it seems like someone is treating him to dinner. He drank quite a bit inside.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are the people all here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry about this, my subordinates already spread out in the hotel, the moment he is alone… Hehehe…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s face also displayed an evil smile, that brat had tried to do some nasty things to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So he was going to do the same this time to see who’s worse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fu-ge, there’s more activity at night. Ol’ Six got a large room at the night club and found seven or eight part-time models. You’re not going?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Five young men, who were about as each other, put their arms around each other and stood in front of Golden Spring Hotel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The one in the middle was Fu Chengming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not going, recently, my kidney is… not that good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fu Chengming was so drunk that he couldn’t really speak properly. The young men beside him wanted to tell him to stay, but Fu Chengmign refused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He blurrily stood on the side of the street, waiting to call a cab. At this moment, Ye Zichen and co., who were already waiting nearby smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within a split second, several young men with dyed hair appeared behind Fu Chengming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A bag was put over his head, and a bat was slammed on top of his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Strip, strip, strip…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stood in the woods with his hands on his waist, while Yellow-Hair’s subordinates surrounded Fu Chengming and stripped him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within a short while, Fu Chengming only had his red underwear left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Ye Zichen looked at this red underwear, he felt like he was going to puke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A man wearing red underwear, and it had to be triangular ones…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just how much of a fetish did he have.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big bro, we stripped him completely.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you guys blanking out for, throw him onto a bench in the park beside Polytechnic University, so he can enjoy the gazes of millions of people tomorrow!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yellow-hair and co. threw Fu Chengming into a van, then drove off. Meanwhile, Ye Zichen touched his head and walked towards the parking lot of Golden Spring Hotel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let me go, let me go…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Ye Zichen was about to drive away, he heard a weak cry for help.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let me go, bastard…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shook his head, he shouldn’t butt into too many people’s business.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Help!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, he still retracted the hand that had reached out to the car door. Alright, he truly couldn’t do something like watching people die.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The parking lot was very large, and there were a lot of cars.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Judging from the girl’s call, she was probably being raped in a car.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fiery Eyes of Truth, turn on!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stood on spot and looked around at the surrounding cars. Not long later, he saw the girl in a business car not far away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang, bang bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen knocked on the car window. The window of the business car was not transparent, so people couldn’t see what was going on inside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was why the person would choose to commit the crime in this car.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Ye Zichen knocked on the car window, the car fell into silent, but it still wobbled intensely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whoever is inside, come out!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uhm,.. Help…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Resisting to the end!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded slightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll give you three seconds to consider whether you’re coming out yourself, or whether I’ll trash your car.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Three!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two!</span></p>
 <p><span style>One!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re not coming out? Alright!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked around to ensure that no one was there, then swung his arms a bit before punching towards the window of the car.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The glass immediately shattered into smithereens.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, another punch followed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, all of the glass on the car shattered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was able to see a girl with a shocking birthmark on her face lying underneath a middle-aged to senior man through the car window.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The girl was wearing the clothes for the waitress of the hotel, it seems like she was a waitress at Golden Spring Hotel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most importantly, Ye Zichen knew the girl.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Li Jiayi!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style> Li Jiayi revealed a hint of joy when she saw Ye Zichen, but her reply lacked any strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Ye Zichen noticed that there was a sickly red on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You bastard!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen kicked open the car door with a kick and dragged that fatty out of the car.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck off.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that the aluminum glass windows were shattered with two punches, the fatty didn’t dare to say anything. He immediately scrambled away, while even ditching his car.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen picked Li Jiayi up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He saw that her skin was slightly pink, as if she was a ball of fire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck, this fatty is too much of an animal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen swore angrily. Li Jiayi was his classmate in high school. She had an eye-catching birthmark on her left cheek.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To be honest, if you just looked at the side of her face, she was definitely a beauty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, that birthmark affected everything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, I’m so hot…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Jiayi wrapped her arms around Ye Zichen’s neck and stuck to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop being f*cking hot, it’s even hotter for me than you!”</span></p>
