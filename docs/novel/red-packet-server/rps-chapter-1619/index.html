<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Gu Li stood in the skies. As soon as he gave his warning, the immortals gathered around the periphery of the Divine Mausoleum really did have no choice but to leave.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, one look at their expressions and it was clear that this wasn’t of their own free will.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>They’d been sent packing!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This is much more comfortable.” After shooing the immortals off, Gu Li’s eyes flashed with a hint of a smile. There were now only two people within a hundred meter radius of the Divine Mausoleum: Ye Zichen and Gu li.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Everyone was keenly aware that the mausoleum hid enormous good fortune, yet the others had been chased off, and for no apparent reason.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>How could the immortals give up just like that?</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After getting shooed off, many of the immortals turned back and gathered around the mausoleum. However, by the time they returned, Gu Li placed a seal around the periphery. Never mind this bunch of sky immortals and immortal kings; not even rulers of the Upper Three Realms could have broken this barrier so easily.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The immortals tried out countless magic treasures in an attempt to break through. But at their cultivation, they were like mayflies trying to shake a tree; breaking in was a foolish dream.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Emperor Ye!” One of the immortal experts strode forth. Then, from hundreds of meters away, he bowed politely. “Might I ask what is the meaning of this?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>That he recognized Ye Zichen naturally meant he’d been living in the Lower Three Realms for quite some time.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At least, he wasn’t a member of the younger generation born after the leyline returned.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It was Gu Li who’d chased them out, but talking to him was hopeless. They could only press Ye Zichen for answers. Although he was the revered Emperor Ye, in the face of such good fortune, the immortals didn’t care.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Good fortune has always gone to those fated to obtain it. Since this mausoleum descended in our Immortal Region, and since we were fortunate enough to rush here in time for the Mausoleum to open, that means we are fated to enter. Yet you’re just forcing us away? Have you even considered how this will disappoint the countless people who look up to you in the Immortal Region?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You’ve got a clever tongue.” Before Ye Zichen could respond, Gu Li stepped in the air and appeared before the immortal who’d spoken up.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When they saw this, Ye Zichen and his allies rushed over for fear that Gu Li would simply kill the man.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Given his cultivation, if Gu Li wanted to kill an immortal king, it would take practically no effort at all.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Gu Li!” Ye Zichen shouted.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Li titled his head, glanced at him, and snorted. “Don’t worry. I know they were once under your jurisdiction, so I won’t take their lives. But we have to make them understand their current situation. You needn’t say anymore. Just leave this up to me. You…. are too soft-hearted.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>With that, Gu Li looked away. The cold, indifferent look in his eyes made the immortals feel as if they’d been plunged into an icy abyss. Even the immortal king who’d spoken up was rendered too scared to even speak. His gaze was extremely complicated.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He didn’t want to give up on possible good fortune, but he was terrified of the man before him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“What do you want? Don’t tell me you’re going to kill me?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Kill you?” said Gu Li with a cold laugh. “You think I wouldn’t dare?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The immortals couldn’t get through the barrier on their own, but the barrier didn’t have the slightest effect on Gu Li. He stretched out his hand, then grabbed the immortal king by the neck, his eyes filled with pride and disdain.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The immortal king’s face reddened; he couldn’t breath. His eyes bulged, and his tongue jutted out.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, shortly after, Gu Li flung him away. The immortal king then crouched, clutched his neck, and coughed repeatedly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“If I wanted to kill you, it’d be as easy as killing a bunch of chickens. If not for my respect for your Emperor Ye, do you think you’d still be standing there now?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Although Gu Li didn’t actually show off his cultivation, the immortals all stopped.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Looking into their eyes, their terror of Gu Li was readily apparent. Gu Li then continued, “By chasing you off, I’ve saved your life. You really think that this mausoleum is your good fortune? You’re mistaken. For you, not only is this not good fortune; it’s a calamity. A bunch of human immortals, sky immortals, and immortal kings think they can get their mitts on the treasures of the Divine Mausoleum? What a joke!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Venerate, is what Gu Li’s saying…” Ye Zichen glanced at Venerate Spirit Treasure.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Venerate Spirit Treasure nodded slightly. “Everything he’s saying is true. For little guys like them, the mausoleum appearing here is a calamity. You don’t even need to think too hard. Take the few of us. Which of us couldn’t destroy this entire plane singlehandedly?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Zichen and his friends were well aware of that.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Li, meanwhile, was still talking to the immortals. “You ought to thank your Emperor Ye. If not for him, given my former habits, you’d all be reporting into the Underworld by now. You wouldn’t even have the chance to stand here pointing fingers and throwing fits. Forget it. I won’t waste time talking to you. If you can’t accept being chased off, then… let me say this. I can chase you off because I’m stronger than all of you combined!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In an instant, Gu Li’s aura surged forth, like a vicious beast. The skies of the lower planes couldn’t handle this much pressure, and they shattered like a mirror.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When he unleashed his aura, Gu Li did his best not to hurt any of the immortal kings.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But even the remnants of his power left them in a pitiful state. Some of them coughed up blood, while others fell down to earth and couldn’t get back up. Only the peak immortal kings could remain steady, but even they were in poor shape.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He only displayed his ruler aura for an instant as a display of power. After intimidating them, Gu Li retracted his aura. His eyes were as cold and indifferent as ever. Without so much as another look at the immortals, he turned to Ye Zichen and said, “Have your people lead them away. Also, if you don’t want a massacre, you’d best tell them to evacuate the Immortal Region.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Zichen took a deep glance at Gu Li. Then, he no longer hesitated. He directly ordered Great Emperor Qingming and Xue Lan to attend to this.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After receiving their orders, they left. Gu li then reached out his hands.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Zichen didn’t even need to think. He knew that Gu Li wanted the remaining key fragments.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, just as he was about to pass Gu Li the key fragments, his hand paused in mid-air.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“After the mausoleum opens, will anyone else show up?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Why are you asking that all of a sudden?” laughed Gu Li.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“If it were just us, there would be no need for this. But since you said something about preventing a massacre, then…”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Hm, it’s just as you think.” Gu Li nodded. Then, his gaze turned serious. “There will be others, and a lot of them at that. And their ranks…. Will include the people you least want to see!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“The people I least want to see?” Ye Zichen frowned, but before he could guess, Gu Li laughed.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“For instance… Zhou Wu!”</p>
