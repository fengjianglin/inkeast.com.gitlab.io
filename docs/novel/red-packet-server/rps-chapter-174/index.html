 <p><span style>Chapter 174 – The Canopy Marshal got into trouble</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei sat in the front seat and looked at Ye Zichen with a pout and continuously drew circles on his arm with her fingers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I thought you forgot about me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taking the opportunity at a red light, Ye Zichen reached out a pinched her cheek, “How could I? I’ve just been rather busy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk, you’re busy even with going to school. It’s just an excuse,” Xiao Yumei was dissatisfied with his excuse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Due to this, Ye Zichen could only smile wryly. Then, he started up the car when he saw the lights change.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen and Xiao Yumei arrived at the jewelry store that Zu Siliang had gifted him, Li Shuang quickly walked up to him after they entered the door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After becoming the manager, she cut her hair short, revealing an aura befitting that of a strong independent woman in the city.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at the jewelry store. Although Li Shuang had only taken it over for a short while, it still looked very proper under her handling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ve done pretty well,” Ye Zichen pursed his lips and smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Shuang revealed a confident smile, “It’s not bad.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t chat here, let’s go to the VIP room.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, I’ll go and inform them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen walked to the VIP room with Xiao Yumei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s with this jewelry store? And what’s with that girl?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei frowned. This jewelry shop was not much smaller than hers, and more importantly, that female shop manager…</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was something wrong with her gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This shop is the reason I brought you over. Since you’ve always been running a jewelry business, I want to merge this jewelry store with yours.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>To be honest, this jewelry store didn’t matter to Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But there was no reason to not take such a large jewelry shop since it was offered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was a layman when it came to management. It was fortunate that he had a strong woman like Xiao Yumei, to help him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As for the girl, she’s the shop manager of this shop.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dongdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A knock on the door to the VIP room sounded out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei stopped herself from saying what she had planned. Then after looking at Ye Zichen, she straightened her back, “Come in.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Shuang pushed open the door. The moment she entered the room, she felt a gaze glaring at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She looked up and noticed that it was the woman who came with her boss.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She ignored Xiao Yumei’s gaze and directly walked in front of Ye Zichen with a normal expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pointed towards the chair opposite him, and indicated for her to sit down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Li Shuang sat down, Ye Zichen also started to speak, “Let me introduce you. This is Xiao Yumei.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hello,” Li Shuang nodded slightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei also smiled without replying.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Such a weird atmosphere.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled stiffly, then coughed, “It’s like this, she’ll take over this jewelry store from now on, so Li Shuang, just work under her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Ye Zichen felt a bit of pain at his waist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He turned his head and looked at Xiao Yumei, and saw her maintaining a faint smile towards Li Shuang, “You should have something that makes you stand out since you can become the shop manager of this jewelry shop. Just briefly tell me about your management ideals.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, Li Shuang and Xiao Yumei started to chat, leaving Ye Zichen with nothing to do.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He sat on the side and took out his phone, then looked at the advancement of the Immortal Heart of Pure Yang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>False Spiritual Body (Experience: 2/100).</span></p>
 <p><span style>Current Immortal Heart Level: 2. Experience gained per day: 2.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seems like he would seriously need more than a month to reach the Spiritual Body level. It seemed like it’s too slow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a retort that might actually cause others to beat him to death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Using only 50 days to ascend from the False Spiritual Body level to Spiritual Body level would only make a person a monster for the rogue cultivators outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Ye Zichen had nothing to do, he went to lurk in the Heavenly Court’s WeChat group once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: Did you guys know…</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Know what!? &lt;insert a row of shocked emojis&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mother of Lightning: Know what!? &lt;insert a row of shocked emojis&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: People like you who only speak half a sentence is truly annoying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: Watching intently in the front row.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: Someone new appeared on the Reputation Leaderboard of the Three Realms. I wonder who this master is.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: How did you know!? Don’t bullshit with us!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: How could I? Erlang Shen, you are also someone on the leaderboard, wouldn’t you know after taking the leaderboard out for a look?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reputation Leaderboard of the Three Realms!</span></p>
 <p><span style>What kind of high-end topic were they chatting about?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t resist the curiosity in his heart, and so directly asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s the Reputation Leaderboard of the Three Realms?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: Welcome, great deity. Great deity, can you tell Yue Lao to sell the snacks at a slightly cheaper price?</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Great deity has come.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mother of Lightning: Great Deity, Yue Lao said that he got his stock from you. I want to be a retail agent as well, is that okay? If you are willing, then I can… &lt;insert of roll of blushing emojis&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: I’m still here!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The group immediately turned into a mess. When Ye Zichen took a look, he saw that most of them retorted about Yue Lao selling the stuff too expensively.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I wonder how high that geezer is selling the stuff, he could actually make the people so angry.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I might need more retail agents in the future as well. I will speak with Yue Lao about the price, but before then, just what exactly is the Reputation Leaderboard of the Three Realms @Canopy Marshal!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He received a reputation point a few days ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Back then, he also activated the reputation mode.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he didn’t pay much attention to it. When he saw that Canopy Marshal and co. were mentioning it, he naturally got interested.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: Sky Sovereign, are you perhaps not someone on the leaderboard?</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why can I feel the mockery from him through this cold screen?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes and curled his lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you going to say it or not?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please don’t be angry, Sky Sovereign,” the Canopy Marshal smiled coyly and explained. “The Reputation Leaderboard of the Three Realms contains highly reputed people in the three realms. After getting onto the leaderboard, they are able to participate in the Conference of the Three Realms, and nominate themselves for the leader of the Three Realms and also vote.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s the use of this!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Celestial sovereign, there is a huge use of it. Every single matter on the Reputation Leaderboard of the Three Realms were of utmost importance. It is extremely possible that this single vote could cause a huge change in the higher-levels of the three realms.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Erlang Shen also returned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: F*ck, it really was a new guy, but why isn’t the leaderboard displaying his name?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Aiyo, Bro, when did you arrive?</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why was Erlang Shen like a brainless guy?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why did I choose to become sworn brothers with this guy?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve been here for a while.” Ye Zichen replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, the Canopy Marshal suddenly said mysteriously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let me tell you in secret, the Jade Emperor has ordered Taibai Jinxing to investigate this person. It seems like he’s trying to find out who this person is, it would be fine if he was someone belonging to the Heavenly Court, but if it was of the other two realms… Zeze…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment the Canopy Marshal said this, before anyone was able to reply, Taibai Jinxing suddenly appeared in the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Due to the Canopy Marshal breaking Section 6, Rule 47 of the Heavenly Court’s non-disclosure agreement, three years of salary from the Heavenly Court is to be deducted alongside three million cultivation experience as punishment!”</span></p>
