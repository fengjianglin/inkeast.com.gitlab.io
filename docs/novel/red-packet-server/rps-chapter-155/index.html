 <p><span style>Chapter 155 – The Crazed Han Xiangzi</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen licked his lips, then decided to accept all of the Eight Immortals’ friend requests.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The phones of the immortals within the Eight Immortals manor all rang together. They raised their eyebrows, put down their tasks at hand and took a glance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, that great deity added me,” Lan Caihe put his basket to the side and laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lü Dongbin also threw his celestial sword into the void, “He added me too.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He added me as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He added me as well!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The immortals within the Eight Immortals manor all sounded off. Not long later, everyone set their gazes on Han Xiangzi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Han, that…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Xiangzi already released the hand that he used to grip his phone very tightly with before Lü Dongbin finished speaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had been a very hard week for him to endure. He had to release all of his anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandson, you dare to finally add grandpa.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at everyone’s intimacy level the moment he accepted all of their friend requests.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All friendly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Ye Zichen received Han Xiangzi’s message. He looked at it, then at the intimacy level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laozi knew it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen laughed coldly, it seemed like he already pissed Han Xiangzi off to no end, otherwise, he wouldn’t have said this sort of thing that was unsuited to his identity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you seeking grandpa for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was definitely the type of person that was nice when others were, but nasty, when other people were nasty to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Han Xiangzi wanted to flame him, then just do it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Last time grandpa didn’t finish speaking with you, but you already left grandpa to the side. What’s that supposed to mean?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What else can it mean? Laozi already said that laozi was busy, how would laozi find time for a small fry like you?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Small fry!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Han Xiangzi, who was in the Eight Immortals Manor, nearly swallowed his phone whole in anger when he saw this message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As one of the Eight Immortals, he was actually treated as a small fry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Look at that, look at this grandson’s words, he didn’t take us, the Eight Immortals, seriously at all!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Xiangzi held up his phone for all his friends to see. However, everybody ignored his words and busied themselves without looking at him at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was especially true for Iron Crutch Li. Ever since Han Xiangzi broke his phone, he got angry whenever he looked at Han Xiangzi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You guys are truly loyal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Xiangzi clenched his teeth as he raised his thumb towards his friends.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Since you guys aren’t helping me, then I’ll do it myself!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s be honest. You told Yue Lao to come and find Immortal Lady He, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, I told him to. So what?” Ye Zichen knew that Han Xiangzi definitely sought him out for that. However, in order to not worsen the situation, he added another message. “However, I didn’t tell Yue Lao to find Immortal Lady He for me to pursue her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Han Xiangzi saw Ye Zichen’s first message, he respected him for being a man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But the second message instantly caused him to explode.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Getting Yue Lao to contact Immortal Lady He. If that wasn’t to pursue her, then what was it for!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He hated people that did one thing on the surface, and one thing in the dark.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t bullshit with me. What are you seeking Immortal Lady He out for if not to pursue her?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great Deity Han, you can like Immortal Lady He all you want, but don’t make it seem like everyone in the Heavenly Court has to like her, okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes speechlessly, while Monkey Bro, who was peeking on the side also laughed, “You want to pursue Immortal Lady He? That Han Xiangzi definitely wouldn’t let you go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who the heck wants to pursue her!” Ye Zichen replied, speechless. “Whatever! If they don’t get me, you at least should get me. I’m seeking out Immortal Lady He for that lotus root!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s no use explaining to me, Old Sun. You have to explain to Han Xiangzi.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great Sage, then some help?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Great Sage scratched his face, then leaned back on the seat with a smile, “I, Old Sun, can’t help you.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ungrateful!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>This monkey truly ignored everything like it didn’t concern him. The monkey didn’t think about how much Ye Zichen had spent for him after he came to Bingcheng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now that Ye Zichen had a use for him, he didn’t care.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen took a glance at Great Sage Sun, then returned his gaze to his WeChat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you mean by that? Immortal Lady He is the number one beauty in the Heavenly Court. There are tons of people that like her!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Number one beauty?” Ye Zichen twitched his mouth. “You gave that title to her, right? I really am curious, when you said that, where did you place Chang’e and the Seven Fairies? Do you believe that I’ll screenshot this and send it to the group? If I do that, the Canopy Marshal would be able to call the Four Northern Saints and beat you to death.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I said that Immortal Lady He is the most beautiful, so she is the most beautiful…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I feel like Immortal Lady He is only so-so.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had never seen what Immortal Lady He looked like, but he didn’t think that she could be that beautiful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Immortal Lady He was truly so beautiful, then the Heavenly Court wouldn’t always say Chang’e was beautiful and never mention about how beautiful Immortal Lady He is.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you saying that Immortal Lady He is ugly?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re insane.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was clear that Han Xiangzi’s love for Immortal Lady He had reached a crazed level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To be honest, Ye Zichen respected him quite a bit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It really wasn’t hard to like someone for so long.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But even so, he couldn’t be so unreasonable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes, then deleted Han Xiangzi from his contact list. He didn’t want to chat with that crazed man anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You dare to scold me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Xiangzi replied angrily when he saw the message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Friend verification…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that his message failed to send, Han Xiangzi stood up in anger, and threw the phone forcefully onto the ground with his right hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s pissing me off!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s pissing me off!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, another one was destroyed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cao Guojiu shook his head with a sigh when he saw the floor covered with remains of a phone that had been smashed into smithereens. A phone was a rare product in the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Iron Crutch Li’s phone was broken, it took the eight of them to put enough money together to buy a new one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now another one was broken.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed like there was no need for Han Xiangzi to use a phone anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Han, I feel like you’re too impulsive.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, Lan Caihe did read Han Xiangzi’s chat with Ye Zichen, and did see in person that Ye Zichen say that he didn’t want to pursue Immortal Lady He.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m impulsive? That grandson said that Immortal Lady He is ugly!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He didn’t seem to have said that,” Lan Caihe sighed helplessly. “It’s all your guessing, it’s not right for you to keep assuming his thoughts.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lan Caihe, are you still treating me as a bro!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Xiangzi glared at him. Lan Caihe shrugged timidly and didn’t dare to say anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His sworn brother, in front of him had gone crazy, there was nothing he could say.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cao Guojiu saw all of Han Xiangzi’s actions clearly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then after a sigh, he took a glance towards Elder Zhang Guo, “Old Zhang, chat with that great deity.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“About what!” Elder Zhang Guo caressed his beard. “We don’t know the attitude of that great deity towards us, the Eight Immortals. Going to find him just like that might make him unhappy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That great deity wants the Nine Heart Lotus Root. Old Han, you thought too much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lü Dongbin, who did not speak at all, suddenly spoke up, and put his phone in front of Han Xiangzi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He immediately went to chat with Ye Zichen the moment Han Xiangzi broke his own phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nine Heart Lotus Root? Who wants the Nine Heart Lotus Root!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Immortal Lady He walked in from the outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She couldn’t help but frown when she saw the smashed phone on the floor, “Han Xiangzi, what kind of crazy are you today!?”</span></p>
