 <p><span style>Chapter 229 – Tall Guy, You Reincarnated</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, I have business with you! Answer me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes while feeling Xie Lei’s extremely arrogant tone, which also caused him to want to flame Xie Lei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Liu Qing did not bring the phone over, Ye Zichen would have exploded upon seeing the brat’s tone.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ye Zichen, calm down, you still have things to ask him for help.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen repeated it to himself a few times, then replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I knew that you would be there,” Xie Lei’s message revealed unspeakable certainty. “I recently broke the Transformer you gave me, and Bu Er is getting a bit bored with the puzzle. Come and give us new ones.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re insane!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye ZIchen truly couldn’t help it the instant he saw the message.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Who does he think he is? Xie Bian?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>That commanding tone, what, does he think that I’m his servant? I need to give it to him just because he wants it, does he think that I owe him?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What kind of tone are you taking with me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was clear that Xie Lei had gotten angry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled, while a look of disdain appeared in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So what if I speak like that to you?” Ye Zichen sent the message, then typed extremely quickly. “The last time I sent you a Transformer was for our deal, now we don’t owe each other anything. What did you mean earlier? I owe you? Or am I your servant?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t be so short-tempered!” Liu Qing patted Ye Zichen’s shoulders. “What are you arguing with him for? If you are unhappy, just ignore him. Actually, I dislike him quite a lot too.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m just annoyed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen caressed Liu Qing’s hair, then sent another message in the chat with Xie Lei, who did not reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aren’t you guys, the Xie family, all about equivalent exchange? It’s okay if you want Transformers and puzzles! What are you going to use to trade with me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you want?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Lei twitched his mouth and replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Help me find a ghost, she only has a spiritual soul. Her name is Zhang Lingling, if you can help me find her, then I’ll give you a Transformer and a puzzle..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was way too easy for him, who was a child of the Xie family. There were no ghosts that they, the Xie family, cannot find information on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will help you find that soul as quick as possible, we’ll talk then.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your intimacy level with Level 1 Ghost Messenger Xie Lei. Current intimacy level: 100.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Intimacy level leveled up. Current intimacy level: Friendly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The intimacy level increased just like that. Also, that brat’s level… He’s a Level 1 Ghost Messenger.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>This is even f*cking higher than White Impermanence’s rank.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Xie Bian definitely helped him level it up.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen retorted bitterly in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing who stood on the side jumped in front of Ye Zichen with a giggle and stared at the phone in his hand, “Can you return the phone to me now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This girl… It seems like she really is addicted to doujinshis.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>On the next day, while Ye Zichen was sleeping on the bed, he randomly heard endless footsteps and the sound of urging within the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen opened his eyes blurrily, and saw that all of his bros in the dorm had woken up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What time is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen took out his phone to look at the time. It was only slightly more than eight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you guys wake up so early for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“For class! Ye Zichen, stop sleeping, hurry and wake up,” Zhang Rui hurried Ye Zichen, while he put on his vest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen even suspected that he didn’t wake up yet. </span><i><span style>Zhang Rui actually woke up so early just for class.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen swept his gaze across the others in the room. Kang Peng and Bai Yu kept on posing and in front of the mirror. Meanwhile, Zhu Yunbai ran around the room in his slippers and a towel dangling from his shoulder, with a look of excitement on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Kang is going to? I don’t think Bai Yu is in our faculty, right? What’s Zhu Yunbai going over there for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pa.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, a phone flew towards Ye Zichen, while Zhang Rui spoke up, “Have a look.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Major News: Polytechnic School Beauty Leaderboard might be Reshuffled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At nine o’clock last night, this journalist received news that…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen took a simple glance at it, then chucked the phone to the side, uninterested.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>No wonder these guys all acted like they were doped. So there was a transfer student coming.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen took a glance at the picture at the bottom. The face of the person could not be seen due to the dim light…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is there a need to be like this? Isn’t it just a transfer student!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you blind? Can’t you see the title!? The Polytechnic School Beauty Leaderboard might be Reshuffled. What does this mean? The transfer student is a beauty!” Zhang Rui, who had gotten dressed, rolled his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Zhu Yunbai, the youngest in the dorm, said weakly, “Don’t talk about school beauties with Fifth Bro. The school beauties of first year are all in his hands, would he care about this new transfer student…?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This sentence was instantly agreed to by the others in the dorm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen felt the weird gazes of everyone else in the dorm, he laughed dryly and crawled up from the bed, “Uhm… I’ll get up immediately and have a look at the beauty of the transfer student.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can look, but we’re going to make it clear now,” Kang Peng, who was full of muscles, walked over in a tight shirt that revealed his physique, while cracking his knuckles. “You have two school beauties by your side already, so don’t fight over her with your bros, do you understand?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, Ye-zi, you have enough women by your side, give us a chance,” Bai Yu also agreed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…” Ye Zichen, who sat on the bed, looked at the rest who stood on the same front and smiled wryly. “There isn’t a need to be like that, right? We haven’t even seen her yet… What’s more, there are tons of young and capable people in our Polytechnic University, are you sure that you guys can… can…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The others were not affected by his argument at all. They replied together, “Hmph, who cares if we can or not, we have to deal with you, the school beauty harvester, first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who the f*ck gave me this new nickname!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can have a good relationship with the four school beauties and have an ambiguous relationship with both Su Yan and Xia Keke, what are you if you are not a school beauty harvester!” Zhang Rui’s face was full of disdain. If it wasn’t due to their feelings of being roommates for two years, he would definitely beat Ye Zichen up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Yu nodded as well, while Kang Peng grabbed hold of Ye Zichen’s arm and begged, “Ol’ Five, we bros have had enough dog food. This time, let us bros give some dog food out, okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fine, fine, I got it,” Ye Zichen shrugged helplessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Ye Zichen woke up later, the others in the dorm didn’t wait for him as they rushed to the classroom to grab some seats.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Ye Zichen slowly got ready, Liu Qing flew over and teased with her hands behind her back, “Shouldn’t you hurry up? You might miss the goddess later.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go stay in the corner.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk, you’re always mean to me!” The little ghost girl twitched her mouth in annoyance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes at her, then rushed towards the teaching building.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, a call sounded out behind Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tall guy, you reincarnated.”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Original Chapter Teaser:</b>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Polytechnic School Beauty Leaderboard&nbsp;might be Reshuffled</strong></h3>
 <p></p>
 <p><b>Breaking NEWS!!!</b></p>
 <p>At nine o’clock last night, this journalist received news that&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">a transfer student is coming over to Polytechnic University. Now, that isn't anything surprising until you hear that it's a girl. Yes, it's a girl!</span></p>
 <p>As one of the people who has helped out in collecting information for the school beauty leaderboard, I'm sure you should all trust my judgement. Behold, the potential fifth school beauty!</p>
 <p>&lt;insert photo here&gt;</p>
 <p>Although this journalist's source was unable to take a photo of the front of her face, he has informed me that she has breath-taking beauty. Upon the closer examination of this photo, I feel like I can safely say that he was not lying. There is over 90% chance that she might truly change the school beauty leaderboard we have currently.</p>
 <p>So, (ladies and) gentlemen! Let me tell you what other information we know right now. This potential new goddess is in the veterinary faculty and will be reporting into school tomorrow. What's more, she is also in the same year as School Beauty Sun,&nbsp;School Beauty Xia and&nbsp;School Beauty Su, bringing the school beauty counter of their year to a total of 4!</p>
 <p><em>Man, why am I not in that year!?</em></p>
 <p>Lastly, allow me to start a campaign.&nbsp;<strong>PREVENT THE SCHOOL BEAUTY HARVESTER TO DO ANYTHING AT ALL COST.&nbsp;</strong>That is all.</p>
