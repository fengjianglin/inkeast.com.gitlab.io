 <p><span style>Chapter 17 – So-called Expert</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Director Xiao, you’re going all in?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A mocking laugh rang out. Xiao Yumei frowned, then gave the person a cold stare.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason her jewelry chain’s state was like that was mostly due to the man in front of her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, in my point of view, what’s the point of a woman being so strong? Might as well follow me, wouldn’t it be better if the two of us became one?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dream on!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, how long do you think you could possibly last against me?” The man with a dark expression sneered and snapped his fingers. “Thirty five million!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed like he was determined to oppose her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei looked at the very promising looking ore in front of her and clenched her teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Four…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Director Xiao!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before she was able to call out the price, Ye Zichen hurried over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mr. Ye?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei first revealed a hint of surprise in her eyes, then she very quickly smiled. He had saved her daughter, but didn’t ask for anything in return. She wanted to use her contacts to search for him, yet she actually bumped into him here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Does Director Xiao want to buy that ore?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, you also know that I own a jewelry business. The chance of this ore giving out jade is extremely large and it should be a huge amount. I won’t hide it from you, my jewelry chain is currently in danger, and this ore is needed to stand back up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei told him everything about her current situation. Originally, she shouldn’t speak about this sort of thing to an outsider, but she didn’t know why…</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she was facing Ye Zichen, she felt like he had some sort of magic about him, causing her to be unwilling to hide anything from him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded after hearing it and whispered in her ear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Director Xiao, if you buy this ore, then I feel like you might never be able to stand up again!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei’s expression tensed up.</span><i><span style> What did Ye Zichen mean by this?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Was he trying to tell her that this ore would not give out jade?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mr. Ye also knows about stone gambling?” Xiao Yumei asked in a testing manner. Ye Zichen chucked lightly, “Director Xiao, don’t call me mister, it feels weird. You can call me Ye-zi or Zichen. As for stone gambling, I do understand a bit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If it’s just a bit, then don’t bullshit. This ore has a clear patterns and it shows a faint greenness from within, meaning that there is moss inside. These are the signs of a lot of jade. What are you trying to accomplish by running over and saying that this rock would not give out jade?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei’s consultant, Elder Liu, suddenly got pissed. Ye Zichen frowned, then glanced over at the old man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who’s the old man?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, this is our company’s stone purchasing consultant, he is an expert at selecting stones.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Expert!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nowadays, regardless of what industry was, a bunch of experts and masters would always pop up. They didn’t have any true capabilities and merely said stuff.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen twitched his mouth in contempt, then said to Elder Liu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Elder Liu, you said that this ore would definitely give out jade, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course!” Elder Liu said with certainty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what if it doesn’t?” Ye zichen suddenly asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Liu raised his eyebrows, “It’s impossible for this rock not to give out jade.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t care about if it will or not. I’m just asking you what happens if it doesn’t!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stared at Elder Liu closely. Elder Liu smiled after a glance at that ore.</span></p>
 <p><span style> “Buying ores has always been something where the risks are proportional to the rewards. Nobody can promise that all of the stones will give out jade. If it doesn’t, then all that can be said is that the appearance of this stone tricked everyone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In the end, you’re just saying things without shouldering any of the risks, right?” Ye Zichen sneered. He pointed at that huge ore and said. “This is an ore worth several tens of millions, just by saying that it will give out jade, you made Director Xiao do everything she could to compete for it. If it gives out jade, you gain a large amount of commission. If it doesn’t, then you took no risks. Why do you get all the good stuff and none of the bad?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that Ye Zichen and Elder Liu were arguing, Xiao Yumei quickly comforted them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, these are the rules of buying ores. I do need this ore…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rules, rules my ass,” Ye Zichen snorted. “Director Xiao, if you believe me, then don’t touch this rock.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiao Yumei, do you want this rock or not?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Director Bai saw Ye Zichen, who was by Xiao Yumei’s side, his dark gaze turned even more sinister.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, no need for Director Bai to worry. Several tens of millions is not a small amount, can I not consider the matter a little?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei retorted coldly, then looked towards Ye Zichen with a questioning gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, why are you not letting me take this rock?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This rock would not give out jade.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen replied to her quickly. Xiao Yumei clenched her teeth and bit her lips, then looked closely at that really promising-looking ore, then finally chose to believe in Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The rock fell into Director Bai’s hands. He glanced coldly at Xiao Yumei, who was not far away, and said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Director Xiao, this rock is a rock for you to stand up again. You actually gave it up so easily? What, do you not have enough funds?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I truly am out of money, I hope Director Bai gains and wins the bet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei’s expression was as cold as frost. When Director Bai looked towards her, a hint of greed flashed across his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s a certainty that I will win, it’s just that how pitiful it is for Director Xiao. It’s such a good rock.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he spoke, Director Bai paid for the rock. The stonecutter, who stood by the side, also asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Director Bai, do you want to cut it here or take it back to cut it yourself?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cut it here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That rock looked extremely promising, it was highly likely to give out jade or even a large piece of jade. Xiao Yumei had given up halfway. If it really did give out jade, it would be a good way to attack her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, Director Xiao will regret it when that happens.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Liu also laughed darkly at her side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei did not even notice Elder Liu’s comment. She merely stared straight at the ore. Although she believed in Ye Zichen’s words, she was still a bit nervous in her heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If there really was jade, she would definitely regret giving up half-way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The cutting of an astronomically priced ore at the scene immediately attracted a large amount of viewers in the hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The stonecutter looked at Director Bai respectfully, “Director Bai, how do you want to cut it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Director Bai casually picked up a stick of chalk and drew three lines on the rock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cut it along these lines.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ore was very large, and since it was inconvenient to move the rock, they could only move the machine. The stonecutter machine was finally placed on the line Director Bai drew after the hard work of three stonecutters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zzzzz.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A white mist covered everyone’s gaze as the ear-deafening sound rang out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, everyone’s hearts were tense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The crowd instantly turned silent. Only the humming of the stonecutter could be heard in the hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ore was split into two as the saw cut deeply in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the grey and white face was extremely eye-catching. Director Bai’s face instantly turned pale.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This isn’t right, they should have saw green when they cut across the line he had drawn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It lost, it lost!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was unknown who had laughed out at his misfortune. Meanwhile, Elder Liu also frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The happiest person in the all was Xiao Yumei, it was clear through this cut that even if this ore gave out jade, it wouldn’t be worth the price it was bid for.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Director Bai looked at that piece of rock with a pale expression. Losing money wasn’t a big deal, his losing face was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, this ore was extremely big, even though a section was cut right now, a judgement couldn’t be made that easily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cut-Cut it again!”</span></p>
