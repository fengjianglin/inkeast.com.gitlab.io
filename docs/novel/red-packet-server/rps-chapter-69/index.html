 <p><span style>It seemed like the doctor in front of him was that female doctor that he saw when he arrived in the hospital.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Shengmei instantly frowned when she heard that he wanted to be discharged, “Stop messing around. You have a gun wound on your shoulder. The bullet was just taken out and you actually say that you want to be discharged?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen twitched his mouth, “Doctor, I recovered pretty well, and don’t like this sort of place that is full of the smell of disinfectants. Just let me go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Shengmei shook her head, “No, as your attending physician, I have to be responsible for your body. You can’t be discharged in your situation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen felt helpless. It was about to be 6. If he wasted any more time here, then he might not be able to make it to the gala.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Doctor, seriously… I know my own condition the best. Why aren’t you letting me get discharged? Black hearted doctor! Do you just want me to be hospitalized for longer so I would have to spend more!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I said you can’t be discharged, so you can’t. Just lie down and rest. I’ll be back in an hour.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Shengmei snorted and left the ward. Ye Zichen twitched his mouth as he looked at her back, then took out his phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>16:32.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He threw his phone to the side, then squinted his eyes as he leaned back against the pillow. Then, he started to laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Liu Qing, Liu Qing…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing floated out from the Dragon Eye not long later and asked, “What is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen indicated towards the door with his mouth, “Go and help me stand watch at the entrance. Tell me if my mom or that Dr. Huang Shengmei come over.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing nodded and floated towards the door. Ye Zichen immediately jumped onto the floor, then quickly took out his clothes from his closet and put them on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How is it, they aren’t outside, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen ran over to the door sneakily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing couldn’t help but be shocked when she saw him get dressed, “Where are you going like this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aren’t you tell? I’m going to hospitalbreak.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stuck his head out of the ward and looked around. When he saw neither Ye Rong or Huang Shengmei were in sight, he immediately started to run.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Shenmei looked down from the window in her office. All of a sudden, she saw Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She quickly pushed open the window and shouted downstairs, “Ye Zichen!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who just reached just hospital gate, subconsciously looked up when he heard this call.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In that instant, their gazes met.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was found out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, get back here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Shengmei called out from the office window.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen chuckled, made a face, then waved towards her, “Doctor Huang.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Catch him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Shengmei shouted towards the guards downstairs. Hearing that, that surrounding guards immediately came over. Ye Zichen shrank his neck when he saw the intimidating guards, then ran out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This guy…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen got to the Polytechnic University, the school anniversary gala had already begun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the person on the stage was Fu Chengming. His show was a song as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His idol-like and handsome look coupled with his decent voice caused a small commotion in the crowds when he finished singing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, a chair was placed on the second floor of the audience's’ seats, right next to the railing facing the stage. On the chair was a sunglasses-wearing man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Hu, how is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person that spoke was the chancellor of Polytechnic University, Shi Rui.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sunglasses-wearing man smiled faintly and raised his eyebrow, “It’s alright, let’s see more.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fu Chengming gave a deep bow, then left the stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The next performance is also a song. Please welcome out Ye Zichen to sing “Later”!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fu Chengming slightly smiled as he stood underneath the stage. Ye Zichen’s show was originally very far back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, as the vice president of the student council and the person hosting this event, it was very simple for him to change the time of a performance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had already gotten news that this school anniversary gala would be different from before. There was an agency that had come in order to choose artists through the students’ performances.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was very confident in his singing. He was sure that he would get selected when coupled with his looks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for why he put Ye Zichen behind him, he purely wanted to treat Ye Zichen as his stepping stone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only contrast would make him seem more excellent!</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, he could also use the chance to put down Ye Zichen’s pride, so why wouldn’t he do that?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Coming, coming.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rushed out from the backstage with a mic. However, his rash look caused the school directors to frown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So rash.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s young, it’s normal for him to be a little rash,” the sunglasses-wearing man smiled. Seeing that, the Polytechnic University dean also smiled without saying anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Click.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Light shone onto Ye Zichen’s face, who looked down into the crowd.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Riche Bro…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Riche Bro…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Riche Bro…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The students in the audiences all shouted crazily. Ye Zichen smiled and placed his finger to his lips, “Shhhh…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The crowd immediately turned silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not bad,” said the sunglasses wearing man suddenly. Chancellor Shi was a bit shocked, why did he say not bad before the student started singing?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Shi, you are amazing at managing a school, but you are far from capable at picking out artists. This young man is very famous in your school, and is pretty good at managing the crowd. He is a good seed to become a singer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Snap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen snapped, immediately starting the music.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s singing definitely had a magic to no one’s surprise. Thunderous claps only begun after he bowed towards the students and left the stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The entire venue yelled out Ye Zichen’s name in unity. Meanwhile, Fu Chengming, who was beneath the stage, clenched his fist tightly. He never could have expected that Ye Zichen was so good at singing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His face was extremely dark as he heard the calls in the crowd.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Stepping stone!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just who was who’s stepping stone!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“This kid is pretty good,” the sunglasses-wearing man couldn’t help but praise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen returned to the backstage during the passionate clapping.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, Ye Zichen did not manage to sing to his full potential on the stage earlier due to him being slightly nervous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He returned to the chair in the resting area while wishing for more. However, he saw Sun Yige standing there unsure of what to do. Her delicate face also showed a frown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Class Rep.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clapped Sun Yige on her shoulders. She immediately looked up, displaying a hint of smile in her eyes, “You came.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you mean I came? I already finished singing,” Ye Zichen was speechless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Finish? That’s shouldn’t be right. Your performance is clearly after mine,” Sun Yige raised her eyebrows in confusion. Hearing that, Ye Zichen also paused for a moment, but he quickly understood the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the doing of that grandson, Fu Chengming, again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That grandson didn’t dare to do anything on the surface, and only knew these sorts of petty tricks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen cursed in his heart, but stopped caring about the issue. Then, he couldn’t help but ask when he remembered the worry on Sun Yige’s face, “What trouble did you get into?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sun Yige instantly frowned and mumbled, “I... The person singing with me… can’t come."</span></p>
