 <p><span style>Chapter 35 – Team Invitation</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke chased him just after leaving the network café.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did you come out as well?” Ye Zichen smiled while Xia Keke ran up to his side with her phone, “Why did you go easy on me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn’t, I’m very competitive, how could I go easy on you? Alright, it’s late, you’d better hurry back and rest. Playing games until this late is not good for the skin.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen crossed the road, while waving at Xia Keke with his back towards her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will beat you one day.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Marriage string received.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Possessor: Ye Zichen, Possessed: Xia Keke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Current affability level: 10.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ugh.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nearly coughed up blood when he reached the other side of the road. The reason he left so quickly was because he was afraid of this happening.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>However, what was going to come still did.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>On the next day, since he had some Great Recovery Pills on hand now, and because Ye Zichen wasn’t one that liked to drag things out, he directly went and gave the pill to Xiao Hai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Ye, thank you so much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Hai was so worked up that even his arms were trembling slightly as he gripped the jade bottle. Ye Zichen might not know what this pill actually meant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Xiao Hai did.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the Xiao Family was still one of the largest families in Bingcheng, the old man in the family had become more and more sick, his father was not well versed in running a business, and he had only managed to take control of the family not long ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The corporation was already starting to fall apart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He threw everything they had into causing Hao Wen lose everything for Ye Zichen in order to get that pill. During that incident, they had offended countless families.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of that was for this very pill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As long as the old man could stand up once again, then the Xiao Family would never fall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hai-ge had helped me so much, so I naturally had to give this pill to Hai-ge. No need to be so courteous,” Ye Zichen shrugged and said. “Oh yeah, what happened to Hao Wen?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If there are no surprises, then he should be spending the second half of his life in prison.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s karma.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen snorted coldly. Then, since he knew that he had done everything he needed to do, he waved his hand and said his goodbyes to Xiao Hai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hai-ge, I’m leaving.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait a moment, I still have a present for you,” the moment Xiao Hai finished his sentence, a silver Porsche 918 was driven over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s eyes shone like the sun when he saw this car.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To be honest, he didn’t know much about cars, but he had seen this kind of limited edition sports car a few times on Baidu.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I heard that there was only 918 of this model, and it was even harder to find within the country.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“For you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing Ye Zichen’s expression, Xiao Hai smiled while pointing to that 918.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“For me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style> Ye Zichen gulped when he saw Xiao Hai’s determined expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen just might have refused if it was any other present.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But that car…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you, Hai-ge.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen truly could not resist the allure of this car. He started to touch the car with a lick of his lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Buzz…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who just had received a darling car, was just checking it out when an urgent call forced him to stop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, this is Xia Keke, come to the cold drinks store beside school.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“For what?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This lady is looking for you. You dare to not come?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen did not want to get too involved with her. Ever since he and Xiao Yumei confirmed their relationship of being lovers, he stopped having many of the flirtatious thoughts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To be honest, he was rather conservative.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only monogamy could establish a family in harmony.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, are you listening to me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Keke, on the other side of the phone got anxious. Ye Zichen could only let out a sigh and said helplessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll be there immediately.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen chucked the phone to his side, then rolled down the window and waved towards Xiao Hai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hai-ge, I’ll be going.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ten-odd minutes later, at the cold drinks store beside the university.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most of these places were where students from the Polytechnic University gathered. Ye Zichen found a place to park his Porsche 918, then prepared to walk towards the cold drinks store.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he underestimated just how eye-catching his sportscar actually was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment it appeared, a bunch of students ran out from the shop and stared at the sportscar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many female students’ eyes sparkled when they saw Ye Zichen get out from the car.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Some more observative people couldn’t help but to exclaim when they recognized Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Riche Bro, he’s Riche Bro!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Which Riche Bro?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t even know Riche Bro? He’s the one that’s really fired upthe school website!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, Porsche 918, this Riche Bro is a real rich person. I have to go back and quit my group, then join Riche Bro’s fam group…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen heard the conversation of the surrounding students, he could only hold his forehead and sigh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed like another hot topic was going to be appearing on the school’s website very soon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he entered the cold drinks shop, quite a few female students also entered. This might be the so-called celebrity effect, always having some fans around him wherever he goes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen saw Xia Keke wave towards him at a seat near the window. However, she wasn’t alone, there was a woman wearing a cap beside her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You were looking for me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing Ye Zichen’s slightly perfunctory tone after he sat down, Xia Keke looked at him in annoyance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What, you’re not happy that I was looking for you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, no,” Ye Zichen quickly denied it. Xia Keke rolled her eyes and pointed to the girl beside her, “Actually, it wasn’t me who was looking for you. It’s her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hello, I’m Jing Wan, a streamer on the Idealism Platform.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman reached out her hand towards Ye Zichen after taking off her cap. When Ye Zichen actually got a good look at that woman, he paused for a moment.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Oh? She’s quite pretty</span></i><span style>.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>She would be one of the top school beauties if she went to Polytechnic Unversity.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As expected, all streamers were pretty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen subconsciously checked her out with the Fiery Eyes of Truth.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Completely natural!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>They shook hands simply. Ye Zichen couldn’t help but take note that the girl’s fingers were very long, so she would definitely be a good piano player if she chose to be.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Furthermore, the softness of her hands also felt great.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was there when you and Keke had solo’d offline.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen replied indifferently, and casually called the waiter over for a glass of lemon juice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That indifferent attitude caused Jing Wan to be baffled for a second. She was a huge streamer on the Idealism Streaming Platform with over a million subscribers, she had never been treated so coldly before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, you need to speak properly to Jing Wan, she is very famous on the Idealism Streaming Platform, and is very good at gaming.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke warned him, since she couldn’t accept his attitude anymore. Ye Zichen nodded with a helpless expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, alright then, huge streamer Jing Wan, what did you have Xia Keke find me for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Never mind, never mind,” Jing Wan stopped Xia Keke with a smile. Ignoring everything else, this girl’s smile really caused people to like her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to establish a team.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Wan suddenly stood up from the chair, and dipped her head while reaching her white hands out towards Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I sincerely ask you to join my team.”</span></p>
