 <p><span style>In the VIP lounge, a waiter put down some tea, then took his leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After seeing the door close, Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows with a smile, “It’s been a while. I see that the future successor of the Treasure Tower is getting more and more used to it all?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You finally realized that? I’m sure you forgot about me if I didn’t tell Xue Qi to go and get you,” Zuo Mo gave him the evil eye, then poured a cup of tea for Ye Zichen with pursed lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A wry smile appeared on Ye Zichen’s face. Then, he immediately changed the topic, “I saw you doing business just now. Are you sure it’s fine for you to just leave him hanging?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He’s always like this.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Mo thought silently to herself, then glared at Ye Zichen in displeasure. When she noticed the foolish smile on Ye Zichen’s face, she took a deep breath and said casually, “He’s not an important customer. What’s more, we can also talk about the details later. Continuing talking with him just now wouldn’t help us come up with something. It’s better to give him some time to think. After all, continuously forcing the issue was not necessarily the best way, it might be better at times to put him aside for a while.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright. I really am not as knowledgeable running a business as you,” Ye Zichen smiled with a shrug. “I can tell that the Treasure Tower is doing so much better in the Immortal Region.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, it’s all thanks to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, we’re good buds.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>And with that, the atmosphere in the room became a lot more carefree.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh yeah, you have something to talk to me about, right?” Ye Zichen said after a bit of chitchat. “Don’t say something like ‘Can’t I go and get you if I don’t have anything to talk to you about?’ I don’t think I know you amazingly well, but you definitely have something to discuss with me since you asked Xue Qi and Stone to get me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, yeah, you really are the genius aren’t you?” Zuo Mo rolled her eyes. “I just want to make a report for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve started to mass produce fire powder, so we should be getting the finished products starting from three days later with the technicians from the Heavenly Court.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The demonic invasion and how the Immortal Region could only back away from that caused Ye Zichen to realize the difference in strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Immortal Region and to an extent, everybody in the Three Realms, were far weaker than the demons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ignoring the strongest ones, since the difference was truly too great, the ones who would influence the outcome of the situation the most was the common soldiers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In order to make up for the difference in strength, Ye Zichen got the Heavenly Court and Immortal Region to start producing fire powder together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although explosives were not that threatening for those above the Sky Immortal level, it was great against those of the Earth Immortal and Human Immortal level. During the demonic invasion, the Heavenly Court had not yet started manufacturing any fire powder, but if they had…</span></p>
 <p><span style>They definitely would have been able to destroy the demons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now, it was definitely great news for people of the Immortal Region that the Treasure Tower had started the manufacturing of explosives.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s amazing, but make sure to be careful. Don’t underestimate it. Enough explosives can blow up the world.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll be sure to remind them,” Zuo Mo nodded. Then, she bit her lips. “Actually, I wanted to talk to you about something else.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please,” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Actually…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen slammed his cup of tea onto the table. Zuo Mo looked at him in shock as he stood up with locked eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Mistress, there is someone out here… Hey, hey! Why are you forcing your way in!” The waiter outside called.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon, the door opened. Lin Ru walked in and scanned the two people within with a frown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re being rather carefree.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened? I sensed a powerful and strange energy fluctuation,” Ye Zichen ignored her mocking words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That subdimension base of yours shattered. Susu told me to go and get you to see what’s going on. Ugh, seriously, I can’t believe the Master of the Law is being a messenger for you mortals.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s expression turned drastically dark. He immediately ran out without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ru looked at where Ye Zichen disappeared from in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the heck? You’re just going to leave me here?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ru took several deep breaths to calm herself down, then twitched her mouth at Zuo Mo before leaving the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Zuo Liang, who just got to the Treasure Tower, saw Ye Zichen rush out. He wanted to say hello, only to realize that Ye Zichen didn’t notice him at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, he looked at the VIP lounge and saw a furious lady storm out!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s going on?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>When Lin Ru finally disappeared at the staircase, he walked into the room and raised his eyebrows, “Sis, I just saw Big Brother Ye. He was in quite a hurry. Who was that woman just now? Was she here to uhm… catch…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Catch your ass,” Zuo Mo frowned. “Why are you here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Liang’s expression sterned, “The elders of our family told me to get you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now? I thought it’s supposed to be two weeks later?” Zuo Mo replied with a nod. “Alright, I got it. I’ll sort things out here, then return. Let’s see what tricks they’re going to pull out this time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did the space collapse?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A group of people looked up at the shattering space above them on a plain several dozen kilometers away from Maple City.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the subdimension the white-robed man left behind that collapsed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had managed to safely evacuate from the subdimension immediately after things started to go wrong. While nobody was injured, everything did happen way too suddenly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For some of them, they were merely walking on the streets when they realized that the ground disappeared. That’s why many people were shocked and frightened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen arrived in a rush. The surrounding people bowed in greetings, while the women closest to him gathered over, including Xiao Yumei, who was holding Tiantian in her arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Daddy!” The moment the baby girl saw Ye Zichen, she burst into tears. When the subdimension collapsed, she was playing with Lil’ Lan the winged dragon and the floor beneath her disappeared, causing her to fall from the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it wasn’t for Lil’ Lan, she might have fallen to her death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen held Tiantian tightly and caressed her hair. Then, he looked up in the sky.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The subdimension collapsed!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>And he was certain. The main way that a subdimension would collapse was…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The death of its creator!</span></p>
