 <p><span style>Chapter 168 – Big Boss</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the Antique Street.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were plenty of customers here all year round in order to find a treasure, or to get lucky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At a traditional-styled pawn shop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A pool of black dog blood slowly started to dry under the illumination of sunlight, while a red-haired young man with a hat sat beside the pool of blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man was dressed garishly, and his rat-like eyes made it clear that he wasn’t a nice person. What’s more, there was also a huge board beside him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Evil Merchant” was written on it in large writing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qianqian put her hands on her waist and yelled angrily at the door, “Are you leaving or not! If you aren’t then I’m calling the police!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The red-hair sitting there affected her family’s business too much. Her father wasn’t in the shop, so she couldn’t help but take the responsibility as the shop owner’s daughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s okay if you want me to leave, make your boss return that painting to me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What painting, you’ve kept on yammering about that painting, but you just can’t say what painting it was,” clear rage filled Liu Qianqian’s pretty face. “I think you’re just deliberately causing trouble, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, so what if I am?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The red-hair young man stood up from the ground and held the huge board with his right hand as he checked Liu Qianqian out greedily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He licked his lips and reached his hand over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yo, I didn’t notice. You’re actually a little beauty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Be more respectful,” Su Yan, who was on the side, hit his hand away with her bag.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The red-hair teenager looked over, “It’s actually two little beauties.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you like this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qianqian frowned. She had never been in this sort of situation before. Her father would always be in the shop before, and so this sort of situation would never occur.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, her father went to go and get the goods from the supplies, so she was forced to be the owner for the day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She didn’t think that this sort of thing would happen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What am I like?” A playful smile covered the red-haired young man’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When exactly are you going to leave?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How can I leave if the beauties aren’t leaving with me?” The young man licked his lips and stepped towards Su Yan and Liu Qianqian. “Older brother can definitely make the two of you feel reaaal good…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A series of filthy words shot out from the young man’s mouth like cannonballs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, he also gradually reached his hand over to the two girls.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A clear snap followed by a terrible scream &nbsp;out, then Ye Zichen pushed the red-haired young man, who had his arm dislocated, off to the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen!” Su Yan ran over happily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen patted her back as he felt the trembling of the beauty in his arms. Then he looked up at the name of the pawn shop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So you’re Liu Yong’s daughter.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You know my dad?” Liu Qianqian was surprised.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, he frowned when he saw the dried black dog blood on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although it was an era where people believed in technology, businessmen were still very wary of things like having the entrance to their shop splashed with black dog blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qianqian felt that she finally have some backing since Ye Zichen had arrived.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She let out a long sigh, then pointed at the red-hair, who was howling in pain, “It’s him. He is determined for our family to return the painting to him, but he isn’t able to say what painting it is.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then he’s deliberately causing trouble,” Ye Zichen frowned. Since the person couldn’t even say what it was, it was obvious that he was deliberately causing trouble.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen patted Su Yan’s shoulders, asking her to stand to the side, then walked towards that red-hair with squinted eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, what you’re doing isn’t proper, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandson, you f*cking…” the red-hair looked up. When he saw Ye Zichen, his entire face turned bright red. ‘F*ck, laozi was looking for you.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Confusion.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at the red-hair repeatedly, he had taught plenty of blind people like him a lesson…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn’t remember which one this was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You were the one who bought that blue and white porcelain, right!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen instantly remembered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re that brat who sold the forged blue and white porcelain! It’s good enough that I didn’t went to find you, what did you run over here for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck you,” the red-haired young man glared. “Laozi isn’t selling that blue and white porcelain anymore. Return the painting inside it to me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was speechless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Antique Street has a rule. After the deal, everything’s unrelated. Even if you made a mistake, no one would ever offer a refund, especially when it’s someone like you, who only remembered to come after a month or so. I think you’re freaking retarded and went mad from the desire for money!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop it with the f*cking bullshit. Are you giving it back or not!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was speechless. He merely grabbed the red-hair’s arm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crack, crack, crack…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If I snap it back, then dislocate it a few more times, your arm will pretty much turn to glass, it’ll be dislocated the moment anything touches it. Do you want the painting or your arm?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just-Just f*cking wait.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The red hair ran from the crowd as he held his dislocated arm. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shrugged as he looked at the red-hair’s back and walked in front of Liu Qianqian, “What’s with your family, you guys are huge and have such a large pawn shop, can’t you hire a few fighters?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My dad does business based on trust, we’ve never met this sort of situation before, so we don’t need fighters. Only those evil merchants need fighters,” Liu Qianqian snorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled helplessly upon hearing that, “What’s with the brat just now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He-He’s a special situation,” Liu Qianqian stuttered, then quickly ran into the pawn shop to take out a bucket of water and a towel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you doing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cleaning here, otherwise, it’s affect the business a lot,” Liu Qianqian frowned, and splashed water onto the black dog blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A terrible stench was released from the solidified black dog blood the moment it came into contact with water.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen covered his mouth and nose, then pulled Liu Qianqian’s hand, “Stop it, make the grandson do it himself when he comes back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qianqian blushed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let go of me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did Ye Zichen let go with a coy smile. Just when Liu Qianqian wanted to ask the reason behind his words, she saw a group of people suddenly appear outside the pawn shop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person in the lead was the red-hair, while a yellow-haired guy stood beside him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The entire team had their hairs dyed with different colors, it was obvious that they were a very disciplined organization…</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were so hip in such an organized manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was so rare.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, it’s this f*cking brat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The red-hair held his dislocated arm, then pointed at Ye Zichen with a shout.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The yellow-hair beside him looked up…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are you f*cking calling a brat. That is the f*cking Big Boss!” The yellow-hair glared at him, then kicked red-hair to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was completely stunned when he saw the yellow-hair.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Dragon Ball fanatic.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen covered his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He could already imagine what was going to happen next.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yellow-hair walked over towards Ye Zichen one step at a time with a sacred and solemn expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ta! Ta!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Attention!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Salute!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hello Boss.”</span></p>
