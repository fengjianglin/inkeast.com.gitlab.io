 <p><span style>Chapter 590 – Souls</span></p>
 <p><span style>At a crack on the ground…</span></p>
 <p><span style>As a sinister wind howled, one was not able to see the bottom of the crack. If one listened carefully, they would be able to hear the terrible screams coming out from within the crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were no living beings within a five kilometer radius. There wasn’t even a single strand of grass, one of the most resilient plants.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That is the Howling Valley, the place which was called a dead zone in the Three Realms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Act according to the plan. Understood?” Su Liu’er glanced at Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen held the jade pendant in his hand tightly. It was something that Su Liu’er had given to him as they were coming over here. As long as he gets into any danger or sees Gu Li, he would immediately shatter the jade pendant, and she would immediately teleport over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood,” Ye Zichen nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now go in.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded, then put the jade pendant into his pocket and walked into the valley.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The death aura within the valley caused Ye Zichen to feel like he was unable to breathe. Thus, he could only erect a barrier around him with spiritual energy and slowly walk in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gu Li!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shouted every few steps. The video in the jade tablet did not clearly tell him the exact location of their meeting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gu Li!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After an hour of walking, Ye Zichen’s throat felt hoarse from all the shouting, but he still did not see Gu Li.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Roar…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The strange calls from within the valley became more and more piercing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Be careful,” Xuan-Yuan Xiang said in Ye Zichen’s sea of consciousness. Then, the Xuan-Yuan Sword came out by itself surrounding with a swirl of flames and sliced forward. “Activate your Fiery Eyes of Truth. There are souls of the deceased here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Ye Zichen quickly did as she instructed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What he saw was countless souls of the deceased floating around in midair. All of them revealed menacing expressions as they screeched and circled Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They wanted to get closer, but were afraid of Xuan-Yuan Sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are there so many souls here?” Ye Zichen frowned. Then, he recalled the news he had read in the Underworld’s staff chat.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could these be the souls that the Underworld lost?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Capture!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment, a shout sounded through the valley. Ye Zichen looked around and saw King Chujiang, who was in a green robe, holding a box in his hands which was sucking in the surrounding souls.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These souls immediately wanted to escape as if they had seen their arch enemy…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All of you, stay here,” King Pingdeng, who was in a white robe, also appeared, as a large green net fell down from the sky, covering all the souls in the valley…</span></p>
 <p><span style>As well as Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmph, there really is someone in the Underworld in cohorts with an outer realm. I didn’t expect to see so many souls here,” King Pingdeng frowned, while the captured souls wailed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Every single one of them are lacking a physical and a spiritual soul. It seems like someone is using them to increase their strength,” King Chujiang’s face was completely dark. Using the souls of the deceased to increase one’s strength was forbidden within the entirety of the Three Realms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In simpler terms, it was a method of demonic cultivation!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although absorbing the physical and spiritual souls of the deceased could quickly increase one’s strength, it was very wrong!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This seems like it’s no longer something we can suppress. We must see Lord Kṣitigarbha when we return,” King Pingdeng spoke plainly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Ye Zichen also shouted out, “You two, stop chatting up there. Hurry up and get me out of this net!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did King Chujiang and King Pingdeng notice Ye Zichen trapped inside the net.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So, they quickly retracted it. At the same time, King Chujiang also asked, “Master, why are you here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This sovereign cares about all life. I felt like something was amiss over here at the Howling Valley, so I came to investigate,” Ye Zichen smiled.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>As expected of a master.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s reply instantly caused King Chujiang and King Pingdeng’s respect for him to rise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I wonder if Master has noticed anything?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Demon Realm,” Ye Zichen smiled. “There are demons here and looking at these souls…. King Chujiang, it seems like some people in the Underworld is not acting properly!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s words were not just baseless accusations, it was something that he had concluded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Li had set this place to be their meeting point, and the Underworld’s staff chat had also mentioned that some higher-ups are often going to the Howling Valley. What’s more, there were also large numbers of souls, which were the lost souls missing from the Underworld.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After arriving, it was clear that the lost souls ended up in the Howling Valley. What’s more, although the air was filled with a deathly aura, one could still feel traces of demonic energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, there was a very high chance of some people in the Underworld being in cohorts with the demons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How’s that possible? Those of the Underworld cannot possibly be in cohorts with the demons,” King Chujiang immediately shook his head in denial.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled and raised his eyebrows, “Then do you dare to come with me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The deeper into the valley they traveled, the more souls there were, and the denser the violent demonic energy was. At the same time, King Chujiang and King Pingdeng’s expressions only grew darker and darker. They were no fool… Quite contrary to that, all of the Yama Kings were exceptionally bright people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if they didn’t believe it before, they could no longer help but admit…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Someone in the Underworld was indeed in cohorts with the demons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brothers, the time of revolution has come. Why should we become that guy’s goods? Why should we submit to their ideas? Regardless of man or beast, we should be treated equally. Are we just going to allow those guys to suck our souls!? Definitely not, we will resist…” At that moment, a man’s call sounded out from a short distance away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but gasp. </span><i><span style>Is this the start of a revolution!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, the trio quickly walked over, and saw a muscular man with a dark colored face clench his fist tightly as he floated above the other souls as he shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Think about how many of our brothers and sisters died in their demonic claws. Do you still remember how much like living corpses they were like when they came out? Do you want to become vengeful spirits and never be reincarnated!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since you don’t want to, then what should we do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We will resist, we will protect our rights!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, we will resist! We will protect our rights!” The man in the lead continued to wave his fist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The surrounding souls also began to raise their fists under his influence, “We will resist. We will protect our rights!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Blackie!” Ye Zichen couldn’t help but call out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man in the air looked down. When he saw Ye Zichen, he quickly flew over,” Boss!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, the surrounding souls all surrounded King Chujiang and King Pingdeng, and begun to tell them about their sufferings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, get back there!” King Chujiang took out another box, which all of the souls entered, except for Blackie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dark faced guy, you have quite a bit of talent for leading. How about getting an official position in the Underworld?”</span></p>
