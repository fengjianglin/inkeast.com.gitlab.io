 <p><span style>Chapter 68 – Sense of justice</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Saint Maria, Jesus, Buddha, Demacia…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen placed his hands in front of his chest, as he sat in the car and muttered what seemed to be like a prayer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The gunshots were endless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s prayers would become a bit louder every time he heard a gunshot.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck, why was he so unlucky to have come over here with that dumb woman?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>If he knew there was going to be a gunfight, then wouldn’t it be fine if he just had directly handed the car over?</span></p>
 <p><span style>What made him even more speechless was that he could just run away in this situation, but that tiny sense of justice within him caused him to stay.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, that woman doesn’t seem to be able to make it, hurry up and drive away,” Liu Qing slipped in through the gap left by the car window and said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked up and asked, “What did you just say?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry up and drive away.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, the sentence before that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I said that woman is nearly done for!” Liu Qing’s face was full of nervousness as she replied. “She seems to be in a gunfight with some association, but there are too many people on the other side. She is pretty accurate, it’s just that she’s all alone. From the looks of it, it’s definitely going to be completely over for her soon!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Liu Qing finished, Ye Zichen jumped out of the car.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing immediately followed him and shouted, “What are you doing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Going to save her, duh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you crazy? Those people have guns!” Liu Qing shouted at his retreating form.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen took several deep breaths, and placed his hands in front of his chest to pray. Then he gulped and said, “Who cares if they have guns or not, I have to save her. Bring me over.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing looked at Ye Zichen’s pale face and lips, she could hear the tremble in his voice when he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She could tell that he was terrified.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he still chose to go and save Officer Lin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it was anyone else, then they might not understand. However Liu Qing understood very quickly, that’s just the sort of person he was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen slowly moved forward tremblingly as he hid in the bushes, while Liu Qing floated in the air to guide him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tatata…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck you!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was about to piss his pants as he listened to the gunshots nearby.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen slapped himself, and silently urged himself on.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ye Zichen, you’re a man. Don’t be a pussy.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, Ye Zichen managed to make his way through the wilderness as he prayed and gave psychological hints to himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he peeked out from the bushes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tatata…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck, what a sight.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Seven men holding light machine guns were shooting at all over the place at a place not far away, while three men had already fallen beside them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked to the side and noticed Officer Lin’s figure behind a wall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did you come?” Officer Lin had already been hit. When Ye Zichen got to her side, her clothes were already covered in blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I came to fucking save you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen glared at her. At that very moment, Liu Qing suddenly screamed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, sniper!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was shocked, he didn’t know where the bullet would come from, so he couldn’t react at all. He could only subconsciously pull Officer Lin into his arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Argh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen grunted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen!” Liu Qing screamed out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but smile wryly as he felt the pain on his shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This Unbreakable Body really can’t stop hot weapons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The bullet stuck precisely on Ye Zichen’s shoulder blade. He endured the pain on from his shoulder, picked up Officer Lin and ran.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Liu Qing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since the two of them had been together for so long, they had gotten rather in tune with one another.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen ran towards the bush, while the ghost girl, Liu Qing, floated near the criminals and started to cause trouble.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tatata…</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the machine guns fired, Ye Zichen also managed to use his potential at the most dangerous moment. He shot out at a speed of ten meters per second, while carrying someone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen shut the car door, Officer Lin was already sickly pale due to the loss of blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes and cursed as he looked at her dying look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You got lucky.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen opened the Treasure Chest on his WeChat and chucked a Great Recovery pill into her mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Liu Qing also floated in from the outside. The moment she entered the car, she shouted, “Hurry up and run, those guys are coming.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked to the side and saw the some of the criminals already standing out from the pushes as she shot towards his car.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Several criminals also appeared in front of the car in order to block it off.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>We’re doing it!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Tatata.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The bullets left a row of holes on the tempered car, while Ye Zichen held on to the steering wheel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He stepped down on the pedal, lowered his head and rammed the car towards the criminals.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the First People’s Hospital.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s shoulders bled as he carried the dying Officer Lin in his arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Doctor, help.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The hospital staff quickly sent Officer Lin to the emergency room, while one of the female doctors stayed behind with a frown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are there gun wounds.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The woman is a police captain, Officer Lin. As for me…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before Ye Zichen could finish, he felt a headache. Then, everything in front of him turned dark as he fall onto the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the next day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, whose shoulder was wrapped in bandages, casually ate an apple as he laid in the bed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Rong walked into the ward not long after Chief Liu and co. left. When she saw Ye Zichen’s laid back appearance, she couldn’t help but scold him, “You’re pretty relaxed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehehehe…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen laughed idiotically. Ye Rong was extremely worried when she found out that he got hurt. He also realized that he didn’t think everything through properly, so he didn’t dare to say too much.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How is Officer Lin?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Her life shouldn’t be in danger, but she is still unconscious,” Ye Rong sighed lightly. Then, she couldn’t help but exclaim, “Don’t get involved in these sorts of situations. It’s so dangerous!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, I get it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled dumbly. Seeing that, Ye Rong walked out to fill up the water bottle, while acting like she really couldn’t do anything about him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen laid down onto the bed once again after finishing the apple.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Buzz…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The phone beside his pillow started to ring. Ye Zichen looked at the foreign number on it, then answered it with a frown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that familiar voice and gentle tone, Ye Zichen smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Class Rep Sun.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm, it’s me,” Sun Yige sounded so gentle no matter what time it was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What business does Class Rep Sun have with me?” Ye Zichen smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You haven’t come to school these few days. I just want to tell you that today is the school’s anniversary. The gala is starting at 6, are you coming?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sat up from the bed. He didn’t think that school anniversary would arrive so soon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He must go.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn’t give up this sort of chance to be in front of the entire school. He might even be able to use this great chance to flirt with a girl.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go, I’ll definitely be there on time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I’ll wait for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The door to the ward pushed open at the moment he hung up the phone. Huang Shengmei, who was wearing a white coat, walked in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen squinted his eyes and smiled, as he thought about the school anniversary gala waving towards him, “Doctor, I want to be discharged.”</span></p>
