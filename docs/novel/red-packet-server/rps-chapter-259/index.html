 <p><span style>Chapter 259 – Young Master Han, who was messed with</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Han Yu’s expression was rather dark. </span><i><span style>This “Expert” Liu, who nominated himself, did not seem particularly good at his job.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Of course, most of the stones this geezer told me to buy did not make a loss.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But my gains were pitiful compared to the pile of stones that Ye Zichen bought.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just who the heck is that brat!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It was whatever that I, as the older brother, did not take revenge for my little brother, Han Qi, after getting beaten. However, I didn’t gain any face here…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yu muttered in his heart, only to look up and see Ye Zichen walk over with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Han, how is it? Your stones raised in value, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Slightly!’ Han Yu forced a smile and replied respectfully. “But it is naturally less than Young Master Ye!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha, naturally!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen replied in a totally self-satisfied manner, then glanced at the stones that totaled to more than two hundred and fifty kilograms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These stones looked pretty good, and could be called the featured items of this ore trade.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It could be said that these sorts of stone would get fought over crazily by the jewelers, but…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Ye Zichen had no intention of buying them, they didn’t make any move either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen could see with his Fiery Eyes of Truth that that these stones would give out jade, but only palm-sized ones.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll take these three pieces of stone!” Ye Zichen lifted his fingers and pointed at the three stones, causing the jewelers to feel a hint of regret.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were several times that they wanted to buy them, but since Ye Zichen did not have any intention of buying them, they thought that it wouldn’t give out any jade.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>In the end, it seems like he just wanted to buy them last.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Although they regretted it, but when they thought back on how much they earned by following Ye Zichen, they didn’t think too much into it, and merely watched the show enviously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir, this stone isn’t sold according to its weight, it’ll be auctioned with the lowest amount being one yuan.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The heavens are truly helping me!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen laughed manically in his heart. He was only just pondering about how to make Han Yu fight over the price with him, and did not realize that the stone was actually one that would be auction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he decided to put on a look of unwillingness, “Dude, this stone has been placed here for an entire day and no one has bought it, so auction for what. Just directly sell it to me. If it really is hard, then I’ll buy double the price.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yu glanced at the three stones. Even he could tell that the stones would give out jade. He subconsciously took a glance at Elder Liu. The old man caressed his beard, looked at the stone, then looked at Ye Zichen’s desperate look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’ll give out jade, and a huge piece at that!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Han Yu smiled, then walked over with his hands behind his back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but smile when he saw Han Yu, who now stood beside him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shopkeeper, these stones are for auction, right? I’ll pay a million!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Han, you…” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows in false annoyance. “I clearly chose this stone, and now you’re coming to snatch it from me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Ye, he already said that this stone is set up to be auctioned, so how is it snatching?” Han Yu smiled when he saw Ye Zichen’s look of annoyance, causing him to feel very good about himself. “A good stone naturally belongs to the highest bidder!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This stone belongs to me, I can’t let you have it.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I also have to open it up right here in order to anger this grandson properly. After all, he was so cocky in the clubhouse yesterday, and it’ll also serve as a good way to get even for my little brother.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen felt extremely smug when he saw Han Yu’s slightly proud face.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Goes to the highest bidder, just to my liking.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen really was worried that Han Yu wouldn’t say something like that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then so be it, after all, I have to gain this stone, it’ll just be up to how much Young Master Han can pay,” Ye Zichen laughed coldly. “Five million!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ten million!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Twenty million!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thirty million!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yu did not even raise his eyebrows when he named the price. The higher Ye Zichen raised the price, the more he felt like it was worth the price.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Thirty million, twenty million more is enough.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen laughed maniacally in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fifty million!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sixty million!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Enough.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen saw the smile on Han Yu’s face brighten even more, he did stop to get worried about his plan failing if he raised the price even more. Thus, he mocked, “Is Young Master Han not afraid of making a bad bet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even if that happens, I, Han Yu, do not lack the money,” Han Yu replied. </span><i><span style>Ye Zichen saying that clearly means that he has no money left. </span></i><span style>Thus, he mocked in return, “Why isn’t Young Master Ye bidding anymore!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I’ll let Young Master Han have it,” Ye Zichen shrugged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he turned around, smiled towards the veiled girl, who stood beside him, and hooked his fingers, “Go and receive the money!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The veiled girl walked over the girl in red, who was holding a POS machine.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yu immediately felt like something wasn’t right, but he didn’t say anything, and just swiped his card.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After that, he roared at the stonecutter, “Cut open the stone!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The opening of these three emperors of stone attracted the attention with many people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Han Yu felt like something was amiss when he saw the veiled girl stand with Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Open!” Han Yu clenched his teeth and roared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The stonecutter walked up the stage with the machine.</span></p>
 <p><span style>First cut, nothing!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Second cut, nothing!</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter how many cuts were made, nothing came out!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, you f*cking messed with me!” Han Yu glared and cursed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How did I mess with you!? Young Master Han, what the heck are you saying!?” Ye Zichen walked over and glanced at the stone on the floor. “There is jade inside!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, he took up a piece of chalk and drew some lines on the stone, then glanced towards the stonecutter, “Cut it like this!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, all three pieces of stone were cut. Each one of them produced a piece of palm-sized jadeite.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pointed at the three pieces of jade on the floor and raised his eyebrows, “See? Didn’t it give out jade?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen!” Han Yu clenched his teeth. He had spent sixty million to buy three palm-sized pieces of jadeite! “You two worked together to screw me over!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He pointed at the veiled lady and Ye Zichen with a savage expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled playfully, “Young Master Han really knows how to joke. Nobody forced you to bid, so how did we worked together to screw you over? What’s more, I had reminded Young Master Han already, but Young Master Han did not listen! You even said that even if you took a loss, you could afford it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You… You…” Han Yu squinted his eyes, pursed his lips and cursed. “You two screwed me over together, fine… But don’t think that I, Han Yu, is that easy to push around!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? Young Master Han wants to deal with me?” The veiled lady stepped up with a smile. “Stone gambling is all luck. You want to blame us for you taking a loss? What’s more, I saw it just now, you were intent on buying it! Also, I am very curious, why exactly does the Han family, that’s in politics, have so much money for stone gambling? It seems like there really is a need to probe deeper!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fine, you two, just wait!” Han Yu turned around to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who stood behind him, held out the three palm-sized pieces of jadeite, “Young Master Han, the jade you bought for sixty million!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Han Yu paused for a moment, then left the scene without even looking back around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen placed the three pieces of jadeite back onto the table and smiled toward the veiled lady, “How is that? You wanted fifty million and I gave you sixty. I also left these three pieces of jadeite to you. This is fine now, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, but before Young Master Ye leaves…” The veiled lady pointed to the piles of ores. “Please give me a hand and pick out all of the stones that have jade in them. I’m not going to bring these useless pieces of stones back! Is that alright?” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
