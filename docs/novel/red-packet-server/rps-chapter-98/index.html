 <p><span style>Chapter 98 – Adventures at the cold drinks store</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who was holding the phone, laughed idiotically. He truly imagined so many benefits that he would get in the future that he couldn’t quite return to his senses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing sat opposite him with her hands supporting her head as she stared at him speechlessly, “You truly look so idiotic.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes in annoyance after his daydream was interrupted by a ghost, “The hell do you know? Big bro was just talking about business with the people from the Heavenly Court. The Heavenly Court, do you get it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You’re crazy,” Liu Qing twitched his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ghost!” Just as Ye Zichen imagined the blueprint for his beautiful future, a sharp scream rang out outside the cold drinks store.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s heart immediately jumped. Could someone have seen Liu Qing?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing also opened her eyes in fright. The two of them looked over towards the source of the sound and saw that the scream came from a woman, whose face was covered in a very thick layer of foundation, wearing a pair of red high heels. At the same time, a cold drinks store waitress stood in front of her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Phew.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen and Liu Qing both let out a sigh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They weren’t calling Liu Qing a ghost.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stood up to leave the cold drinks store with the mindset of nothing affecting him at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, when he walked to the cold drinks store entrance, he saw that waitress.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hu-ge, I was so scared.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The red high heels woman pretended to be terrified as she reached out to grab the arm of the huge man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man looked up and eyed the waitress before disgust instantly surfaced on his face, “F*ck off, were you born so ugly to scare people?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He picked up the cold drink and threw it towards the waitress. The waitress raised up her drink to block it, causing the cold drink to instantly splash onto the woman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahhh…” The woman with heavy make-up screamed, then instantly stood up to slap the waitress.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t be too outrageous.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen hurried over from the side, grabbed the woman’s hand and pushed her to the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, he turned around, looked at the hurt waitress and said softly, “Li Jiayi, are you alright?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Jiayi’s expression was clearly rather unnatural when she saw Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That day in the hotel…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ye Zichen is still not admitting to it!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Hu-ge…” At this moment, the woman that Ye Zichen pushed aside also screamed. The muscular man opposite her instantly stood up, then reached out his hand to grab Ye Zichen’s shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hands off.” Ye Zichen turned and looked at the man who had grabbed his shoulder with an indifferent gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man instantly felt an icy chill around him, causing him to subconsciously let go of Ye Zichen’s shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I feel like this is a misunderstanding, what do you think?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A faint coldness spread through Hu-ge’s heart once again. He gulped. There was only one thought in Hu-ge’s mind.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This brat wasn’t someone that should be pissed off easily.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, the woman beside him did not think that much. She stepped forward and screamed at Ye Zichen and Li Jiayi, “Are you blind? Did you not see this ugly woman wet my clothes? These are new clothes that I bought!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you believe that I’ll rip your mouth off if you say anything else?” Ye Zichen glared at her and said. “As for your clothes. How much are they? I’ll compensate you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can you afford it!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman revealed a look of disdain, while Hu-ge sneakily pulled on the woman and smiled, “Bro, I feel like you are kind of familiar, I wonder which group you run with?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry about which group I run with, I’ll compensate you for the clothes. Apologize towards her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Apologize? Dream on,” The harsh woman shouted once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehehe…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen directly slapped the harsh woman’s face, then shook his hands with a dark look in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t ignore my words…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You actually dared to hit me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The harsh woman was stunned, then she immediately reached out to scratch Ye Zichen’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What met her was another loud slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t challenge my patience.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hu-ge,” the woman covered her face, then coquettishly shook the man’s shoulders. However, the man completely ignored her and said tremblingly. “Ye… You’re Young Master Ye, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows, he didn’t think that the brat would recognize him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You know me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hu-ge felt that Ye Zichen was very familiar from first glance, but he just couldn’t recall who he was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he finally remembered when Ye Zichen slapped his woman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was definitely a powerful monster.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gulp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hu-ge gulped furiously, then slapped the woman beside him, “Apologize.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hu-ge’s slap completely shocked the harsh woman. She stared at him in shock, then exploded, “Zhao Hu, you actually dared to hit laoniang. You dared to hit laoniang.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The harsh woman raised her hand to scratch Zhao Hu’s face. Zhao Hu clenched his teeth, grabbed held of the harsh woman’s arm, then pushed her before raising his hand to slap her once again, “Liu Zhu, apologize to Young Master Ye quickly!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck you! Zhao Hu, just you wait. And you two, wait right there,” the harsh woman screamed and left the cold drinks store. Zhao Hu gulped as he cursed the woman for being retarded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She might be kind of capable, but compared to Young Master Ye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She’s nothing!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Ye…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems like this woman is more amazing than you?” Ye Zichen twitched his mouth with a smile, then hinted towards Li Jiayi. “Apologize.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sis Ye, sorry. It was I who had eyes, but did not recognize Mt. Tai…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Jiayi, who was on the side, instantly blushed, while Ye Zichen got confused as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was with this brat’s brain? He thought too much into it…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Never mind, nothing really happened to me. Just leave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Jiayi pursed her lips, while the anger in her heart disappeared as if it was due to Zhao Hu’s usage of “Sis Ye”.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows and also said, “Screw off.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ai, ai, yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao Hu immediately scrambled away from the cold drinks store. At this moment, Ye Zichen turned back and asked softly, “Why did you come here to work? Weren’t you working at Golden Spring?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is it any of your business?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>To be honest Li Jiayi felt very vexed, she was annoyed with how Ye Zichen didn’t dare to admit what he did, but then again, he helped her out just now…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Bro, it’s the two of them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The harsh woman, who left the cold drinks store earlier, returned with several policemen beside her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The policemen looked at Ye Zichen and walked over with a frown as they checked him out savagely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I suspect you of being related to the recent smuggler groups, please come with us back to the police station to aid with the investigation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re talking about me?” Ye Zichen pointed at himself in shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Jiayi, who was on the side, also couldn’t help but ask, “Officer, you misrecognized the person, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the police saw the birthmark on Li Jiayi’s face, clear disgust surfaced in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Misrecognized? I won’t do that. Also, I feel like you’re linked with their association as well. Bring them away together.”</span></p>
