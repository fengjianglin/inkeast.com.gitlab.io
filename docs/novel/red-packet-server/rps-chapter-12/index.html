 <p><span style>Chapter 12 – The Handsome Monkey King’s Monkey Wine</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen also spaced out the moment Huang Ming kneeled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry and get up…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that more and more students were surrounding them, Ye Zichen walked over to Huang Ming’s side in order to help him up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he didn’t expect Huang Ming not to get up, and instead, he straightforwardly hugged Ye Zichen’s leg.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Ye, I’m begging you, please just let me off.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t that the fake rich second-generation from the school forums!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It really is, what kind of show is going on now!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Look at that sportscar, Porsche 911!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damn, it really is, what’s going on…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many students had already started to take out their phones to take photos. In an instant the school’s forums had exploded again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was already a recent hot topic, now that this new thread was posted, lots of people instantly appeared to follow the thread.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, in front of the school’s dormitory.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing the students around starting to take photos, Ye Zichen stopped getting angry. He tried his best to pull Huang Ming up, but he was just like an permanent sticker, unwilling to move at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck, if you don’t want to die, then f*cking stand up to speak.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Ming immediately bolted up like it was a conditioned reflex.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Ye…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know the reasoning for you coming here. Go back to tell Hai-ge that I don’t have anything that can save the old man currently. When I do, I’ll contact him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Ye, are you not forgiving me…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that Huang Ming was about to kneel again, Ye Zichen was defeated by his shamelessness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I forgive you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, Young Master Ye, you didn’t forgive me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed like speaking nicely was of no use. Ye Zichen licked his lips and pointed to Huang Ming’s sportscar, then swore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Immediately get on&nbsp;your car and disappear from my sight!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Ye!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you need me to repeat myself?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen frowned. Huang Ming clenched his teeth, then turned around and ran towards the sportscar. While he was leaving, he still relentlessly asked Ye Zichen for forgiveness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After finally getting rid of that sticky nuisance, Ye Zichen quickly returned to the dorm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi, you heated up the school website again…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment he entered the dorm, Zhang Rui threw his phone towards Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After catching the phone, Ye Zichen immediately saw the top thread on the forums.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fake rich second-generation or real rich second-generation? A life like a show, it’s all thanks to acting!</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the thread were photos of Huang Ming hugging Ye Zichen’s legs, as well as a close up image of Huang Ming’s Porsche 911.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The speculations underneath the photos caused Ye Zichen to smile wryly, but what made him even more speechless were the various replies of the students.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were two main parties in the replies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One group of them believed that Ye Zichen was just a low-lying rich secondgeneration. The other thougt that Ye Zichen was simply trying to get famous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The thread was like a battlefield and the flaming was continuous from both sides.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but praise the school website’s advertisement capability. By that afternoon, Ye Zichen actually received a lot of invitations from girls to dine together that night.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was something Ye Zichen had never experienced before. Although he was a bit handsome, this wasn’t an era where he could live on just his looks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What made Ye Zichen even more speechless was that the gossip journalist from the school website actually found him and wanted to do a private interview with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>People truly were as afraid of being famous as pigs where of getting big. Ye Zichen didn’t manage to catch a break through the entire day. Even his brothers at the dorm were interested. Without any other choice, Ye Zichen could only go outside the school to eat by himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Great Sage Sun sent you a private red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s phone suddenly ran when he was sitting at the barbeque store. When he picked up his phone, he saw that the Monkey King had actually sent him a private red packet.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>One who is unaccountably solicitous is hiding evil intentions!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Recently, he had chatted a lot with the monkey King. Ye Zichen understood very well that the Monkey just wanted Wahaha.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Click.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey Wine x5</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, I, Old Sun, knew that you were here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you, Great Sage Sun.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re too courteous, these were brewed by my children when they were playing around. These five bottles were just brewed, so I thought of you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, this little deity is truly honored.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They saw gifting should go both ways. Ye Zichen casually used his phone to scan the Sprite on the table and sent it over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Monkey King received your red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nice, what kind of treasure is this now!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This was gotten by this little deity recently. Good bros should share things, Great Sage can try it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good good, good bro, good bro!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Monkey King was clearly very excited, so he disappeared after his reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>About two minutes later…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Monkey King’s intimacy level with you increased by 30, the current intimacy level is 170, 30 away from Trusted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great treasure, it truly is great!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s good that Great Sage likes it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen did understand Great Sage Sun thoroughly, so he had casually earned 30 intimacy points.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that Trusted was about to reached, Ye Zichen wondered about what changes would happen after the level up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After chitchatting for a bit, Ye Zichen closed the chat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clicked open the Treasure Chest looked at the monkey wine, then at the lamb skewer in front of him, before revealing a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Withdraw monkey wine.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A green gourd appeared in Ye Zichen’s hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he opened the cork, the smell of alcohol rushed out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good wine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, an old man sitting on the next table walked over as he had followed the smell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little bro, can you let me drink a glass?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen wasn’t a petty person, so he lifted the gourd and poured a cup for the old man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The aroma of wine filled the barbeque store for a long time. Many wine-lovers looked over. Even some women that didn’t drink wine couldn’t help but sniff a few times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Monkey wine,” the old man said after having a taste. “But it is more aromatic than monkey wine. The alcohol level also seems lower. No, I have to sip again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The old man muttered to himself, while Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That old man wasn’t simple since he could taste it with a sip.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandpa, you’re sneakily drinking wine again!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A beautiful voice rang out. The old man, who was enjoying it was shocked, and immediately drank all the wine without tasting it carefully. Then he crossed his legs and sang, while he pretended like nothing happened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandpa, the doctor said that you can’t drink alcohol.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When did I drink?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The old man played dumb.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re still saying that you didn’t drink. I saw everything. What’s more, the smell of alcohol hasn’t dispersed yet. Even if you want to lie, you have to make something better up. What’s more, if you didn’t drink, then why did you come over to someone else’s table!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are so many people drinking in the barbeque store, why do you say I drank it?” The old man started acting shameless. At the same time, he twitched his mouth at Ye Zichen, “I saw that this young man was bored eating by himself, so I came to chat with him a few times. Aren’t I right, young fellow?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The old man looked towards Ye Zichen, hoping Ye Zichen to lie with him. However, he saw that Ye Zichen had already blanked out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The girl calling the old man wasn’t just anyone else, it was Polytechnic University’s school beauty, Su Yan.</span></p>
