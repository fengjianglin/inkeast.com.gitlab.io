 <p><span style>Chapter 594 – The Domineering Lu Lu</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior, why are you so stubborn? Why do you keep on saying that I’m a demon?” Ye Zichen shook his head helplessly. “The pill I gave you just now was a healing one. As for why I have the Tower Head Token, it’s because I have a bit of relationship with the Treasure Tower, and Lady Zuo Mo is a good friend of mine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Mo,” the elder’s blurry eyes displayed a bit of emotion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, he used a tiny portion of the slither of spiritual energy to check up on his body’s condition. </span><i><span style>He’s telling the truth, he really gave me a recovery pill.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Kid, do you think that I will believe you just like that?” the elder snorted. “You despicable demons, you can do anything. Don’t think that faking kindness will make me believe you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whatever, I’m not going to waste my breath with you anymore. Do you know if a girl called Su Yan is imprisoned here? And if you do, where is she?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This old man’s too stubborn, I can’t be bothered with him. I came here to save Su Yan.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you want!?” the elder snorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I came here to break her out. She’s my girlfriend,” Ye Zichen glanced at the elder. “If you know, then tell me. If you don’t want to tell me, then I’ll look for her myself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen transformed back into an insect. At that very moment, the elder stopped him from leaving, “I don’t know where the Su Yan girl you’re talking about is, but I do know that there is a girl in this prison. She didn’t seem like a demon. She’s at the very depths of the prison, you can go over to take a look.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thanks.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Ye Zichen got out of the elder’s cell, he immediately flew towards the depth of the prison.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The truth showed that the elder did not lie to him. There was indeed a woman locked at the end of the prison hall. However, there was only a single oil lamp within, so the dim light was unable to shine onto the woman’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Buzz…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen quietly flew towards the woman.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Lu Lu!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was shocked. He understood very well just how strong Lu Lu is. It was no falsity even if he called her one of the strongest existences in the Three Realms. Everybody had to give her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After all, the title of Ice Empress was not just for show, but… </span><i><span style>Why is she here?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Her face was stark white, and her eyes were blanked out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She hugged her legs tightly, and sat against the wall in the corner of the cell. Ye Zichen was unable to tell what she was thinking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lu Lu!” Ye Zichen settled on the oil lamp and called out to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Lu, who was spacing out, looked up in confusion. However, when she noticed that the person she thought she heard wasn’t there, she chuckled in self-mockery, and resumed how she was acting before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lu Lu!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, Ye Zichen directly flew in front of her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Lu blinked, and looked at the tiny insect in front of her, “You…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, it’s me. I’m Ye Zichen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen transformed back to how he originally looked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing him, Lu Lu’s expression drastically changed, then punched him on the chest. “You bastard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, alright, I’m a bastard. But honestly, how did you get caught by the demons? Even the twelve demon sovereigns might not match up to you,” Ye Zichen frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Lu bit her lips and snorted, “It’s all your fault.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My fault?” Ye Zichen was confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, the only reason I’m here is because of you. I wouldn’t have come over here if I didn’t go and look for you in Maple City,” Lu Lu bit her lips, while hints of tears appeared in her eyes. “I’ve ruled in the Three Realms for so long. I have never been treated like this before.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop crying, I’ll definitely get you out of here,” Ye Zichen patted her shoulders. Although she did not go into detail of the situation, since she said it was his fault, Ye Zichen could only accept it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop it, you didn’t come here to save me did you? Tell me, just who did the demons capture to make you risk your life?” Lu Lu twitched his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Su Yan!” Ye Zichen replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Su Yan? How did she get captured by the demons?” Lu Lu squinted his eyes and raised his eyebrows. “I get it now. Ye Zichen, you really are unlucky. Your luck as Zhang Junbao was already terrible. It seems like the demons want to make you worried using your woman.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Perhaps,” Ye Zichen smiled wryly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s think more carefully about breaking me out. You should have seen the two gate guardians outside when you entered, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded. After all, he was nearly slapped by one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Those two gate guardians are left behind to deal with me, but they’re just scum and terribly weak. If I didn’t get poisoned, so that I can’t even use a hundredth of my actual strength, do you think I would stay here?” Lu Lu snorted domineeringly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen glanced at her.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>She wasn’t like this before!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You scared?” Lu Lu raised her eyebrows. “Ahh right, this should be the first time you meet my main body. You only talked to my Body Double before. I’m telling you, I’m like this. You have to marry me whether you like it or not.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…” Ye Zichen was rather confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh well, it’s too early to talk about all this with you. Can you see if you can get me a cure? I can definitely help you slaughter the way out if you can get me the cure. Getting Su Yan back is just a small thing then, I can even help you shatter this sub-dimension,” Lu Lu patted her chest in certainty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Ye Zichen squinted his eyes, “This is a sub-dimension?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you think? The Demon Realm is tiny as it is, they can’t live without using sub-dimensions,” Lu Lu smiled. “Most demon higher-ups have their own sub-dimension.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“307, stop shouting. You speak to much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop shitting me. Come over here if you dare. I’ll slap you to death,” Lu Lu replied mercilessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, the prison guard did not dare to retort.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Lu Lu’s probably the only one in the entire prison who dares to talk like that to the prison guards!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Keep pretending. When Lord Gu gets the Beast Fire, then you’ll just be moaning underneath him,” the prison guard muttered as he walked away. Although the prison guard spoke very softly, everyone in the prison could still hear him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Beast Fire.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just what exactly does Gu Li want the Beast Fire for? Is he going to become stronger than Lu Lu when with it?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, what are you blanking out for? Hurry up and get me the cure,” Lu Lu frowned. “Or do you want me to get on a bed with that Gu Li brat?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have to at least give me some clues, alright?” Ye Zichen was speechless. </span><i><span style>The personality of the Main Body and Body Double are like complete opposites!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Clue? How could I have any clue? Don’t you know Old Lord Taishang? Get him, he’ll definitely have a way!”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Original Chapter Teaser:</strong>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Just what is he on about? Why is he so hell-bent on thinking that I'm a demon? Could it be that they want something from him?</p>
 <p>Collude? Could he be some sort of high ranking official of a factions? If he is… then that'll be good as long as I can provide him with proof that I'm not a demon.</p>
 <p>Or heck, I just need to prove to him that I'm not a demon… but how?</p>
 <p>Also… I wonder if he knows about where Su Yan is. I've searched around for quite a while, but still haven't found her… are they imprisoning her deeper in the prison!?</p>
