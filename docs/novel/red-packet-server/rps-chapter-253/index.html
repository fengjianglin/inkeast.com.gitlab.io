 <p><span style>Chapter 253 – The End of the Troubles</span></p>
 <p><span style>A man with a knife scar on his eye appeared in the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen held Li En’s collar for a long time, while he looked behind Li En at the man.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It seems like there is a wall behind him. How did he pop out?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Who the hell are you!?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows slightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man walked over with a coy smile, “Allow me to introduce myself. This humble one is Wei Chen!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know you!” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes, then turned his head towards Lu Lu. “Where’s my knife? Let me chop this idiot up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Lu happily skipped over to pick the dagger up and returned it to Ye Zichen’s hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Ye Zichen received it, he saw a hole that had a diameter of around a centimeter on the blade.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but turn to glance at Wei Chen, as he remembered the pebble, “Who are you with?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m with Big Sis Xia Keke!” Wei Chen quickly replied with a forced smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was stunned upon hearing that, while both Lu Lu and Mu Jinglei revealed expressions of confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xia Keke! Polytechnic University’s Xia Keke?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, yes, yes, it’s that sis,” Wei Chen’s face was covered in that same forced smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen threw Li En onto the floor bitterly and stepped on him, “How did you end up following Xia Keke!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s a long story!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then make it short!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen always detested people that took a long time to explain it. </span><i><span style>Did his primary school teacher not teach him to summarize his thoughts when they’re too long?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“In short, that’s…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck, who the heck is causing trouble at my family’s casino!? Give me ten minutes to prepare my Tiger Fist!” Someone called out at the entrance to the casino with a familiar tone and phrase…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did this retard come as well!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ai, no! Dad, why are you here!” The teenager with a buzz cut ran over happily. However, the moment he saw Ye Zichen…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck, damn brat, laozi was f*cking looking for you! Give me ten minutes to get ready this time, laozi will…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wei Chen, who was standing behind the buzz cut teenager, kicked him into a kneeling position before he finished speaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go kneel in the corner!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dad, when I said I got beaten up the other day, it was by this brat. He didn’t go by the rules of the Jianghu, and attacked before I got ready! Didn’t you say that you’ll help me get even when you’ve got time? It’s him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man with a buzz cut rubbed his butt in his confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wei Chen slapped his head, “You’re still complaining? Do you want to get beaten up?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood!” The buzz cut young man struck a horse stance in the corner with his head down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at the father and son pair in shock, “How about you two have a good father and son conversation, we just came here to save a person…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then Mr. Ye, take care!’ Wei Chen bowed and smiled coyly. Ye Zichen pointed at the group of injured people on the floor…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you need me to compensate you? You’re Xia Keke’s subordinate, so I do have to take some care of you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need, no need,” Wei Chen hurriedly shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stepped down on Li En, who was sprawling on the floor, “Oh yeah, this brat has a grudge with me. I’ll give you face and leave him alive, but you can’t let him off easy. Also, I just won more than three hundred million at your casino, so I’ll leave my card number with you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you guys have a pen?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen saw both Lu Lu and Mu Jinglei shake their heads, he took a look at the dagger in his hand and Li En, who was on the floor…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He made a small cut on Li En’s finger with the dagger, then used his finger to leave a series of number on the betting table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Here’s the bank card number. Remember to wire it to me, I’m lacking money!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Ye Zichen and his group left, Wei Chen’s face, which was originally covered in a coy smile, turned dark as he squatted on the floor and yanked Li En up, “Director Li, I hope you will wire the money to the casino’s account tomorrow! Three hundred million and not a cent less, do you understand?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wei Chen patted his face, then kicked him away. Then Wei Chen walked in front of the buzz cut young man and kicked him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man with a buzz cut kneeled on the floor, then muttered as he rubbed his head, “Why did you hit me again!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Think about it yourself. If you don’t manage to understand, then don’t eat tomorrow!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Mu Jinglei drove on the way back, Mu Chuang lowered his head without saying anything, while the former remained silent as well…</span></p>
 <p><span style>They managed to save him, but the atmosphere was extremely tense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sis, I was wrong!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chuang, who had not spoken until then, suddenly looked up as they neared the city. Mu Jinglei immediately stepped onto the brakes…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You still know your wrongs!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sis, sorry!” Mu Chuang lowered his head and apologized softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen patted his shoulders, then spoke up, “Jinglei-jie, I’ll have a chat with Lil’ Chuang outside of the car.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Jinglei nodded, while Ye Zichen dragged Mu Chuang out by his collar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment they got out, Ye Zichen punched him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did you hit me?” Mu Chuang glared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen squinted his eyes, then dragged Mu Chuang out ten odd meters by his collar, “I’ll save you some face and not chat in front of the car door. Say it, why did you screw over your sister with Li En?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know what you’re talking about!” Mu Chuang frowned, while he avoided Ye Zichen’s gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t know, right!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye ZIchen punched him again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not Jinglei-jie, who can tolerate you no matter how huge the stuff that happened is. You should know that I was a delinquent in the village. Lil’ bro, did you forget all that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chuang gulped. </span><i><span style>How could I forget?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen-ge, I beg you, don’t tell my sister,” Mu Chuang clenched his teeth and looked down. “I needed money!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then!?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It was obvious that he needed money since he told his sister to get him back with three million, while cooperating with a scum like Li En.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I did lose money at Li En’s, but it was only several ten thousand yuan. I had wanted to win some from him since I had always won before…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe… Continue!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Won? That’s because he wanted you to!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>The house always wins, it was a saying that everybody knew. Him continuously winning meant that something was up!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“After I lost, I wanted to win my money back, so I went to borrow money from Li En. That’s when Li En requested me to lie to my sister, and I agreed!” Mu Chuang stuttered and spoke out everything that happened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clenched his fist and wanted to hit Mu Chuang, but then he couldn’t help but frown when he saw Mu Chuang’s dodgy look, “You still didn’t say why you need money.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I-I fell for a girl!” Mu Chuang blushed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You need several million for falling for a girl?” Ye Zichen asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She’s different from others,” Mu Chuang clenched his teeth. “She works at a clubhouse. I merely saw her from a distance before…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm, then…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Bro, she’s not the type of girl like you think she is! She merely chats with people,” Mu Chuang quickly explained. “Her price for chatting with people is very high, I needed the money to talk to her…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So low!” Ye Zichen twitched his mouth. “but this isn’t a reason for you to lie to your sister. Didn’t you know that you were pushing her into a firepit!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I-I was wrong!” Mu Chuang lowered his head even more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sighed as he saw Mu Chuang’s self-reprimanding look, “Never mind, big bro will take you to that clubhouse tomorrow to fulfill your wish!”</span></p>
 <p></p>
