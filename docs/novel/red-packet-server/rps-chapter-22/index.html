 <p><span style>Chapter 22 – A Grey for the Booster Goddess</span></p>
 <p><span style>A light-speed first blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone in the dormitory was shocked as they watched Ye Zichen, who was relaxing completely naturally.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they were playing LoL before, they were terribly thankful if Ye Zichen didn’t give up first blood. The fact that he actually got first blood completely shocked them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Fiora on the other side is too crappy, right? Ol’ Five got first blood!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is his biaodi playing or something?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My god…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen also showed a shocked expression. Indeed, he had never met this sort of situation before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Could what they said be true? It really was the cousin playing on the other side?</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, in the voice chat for LoL.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Goddess, what happened, how did a Master give first blood to a Gold?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shocked exclamations sounded out across the voice chat. They were a set elo-booster team from all over the country.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The one playing Fiora was the only female on the team. Her main account was Master on Ionia, people in the circle all called her Booster Goddess.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I got distracted.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Booster Goddess answered vaguely. When she said this, she blushed a little.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, she was concentrating fully when she was fighting just now, she just didn’t know how the other person dodged all her abilities.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their manipulation of the champion could be only described as completely fluent. It didn’t seem like a Gold player at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Could the other person be an elo booster as well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Booster Goddess had her suspicions. But so what, as a Master player, even if she meets other elo boosters, she wasn’t afraid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This time I’ll play properly and destroy him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Booster Goddess laughed coldly, causing the people in voice chat to instantly cheer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These people had played together for a very long time, they understood each other’s strengths very well. The Booster Goddess was the best in terms of controls on the team.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The team had utmost confidence in her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But…</span></p>
 <p><span style>An ally has been slain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Booster Goddess was slain once again in less than three minutes of laning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi, what happened. You solo-killed her again!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damn, it can’t be. Could it be that Fifth bro has a talent for top…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone in the dorm raised their eyebrows. At the same time, the booster team also exploded in voice chat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Goddess, have you been drinking?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Goddess, don’t worry, wait for me to gank him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Booster Goddess turned silent as she stared at the dark screen.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That shouldn’t have happened!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>She was Master!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t believe it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Booster Goddess turned completely serious. At the same time, Kang Peng also returned from the bathroom. Right after entering the room, Ye Zichen returned Riven to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, not bad, Ye-zi. You killed two? The biaodi is playing on the other side, right?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ugh.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was speechless, he truly had no way to stand up in the dorm when it came to LoL.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With two kills, Riven against Fiora was a huge advatange.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kang Peng swore that he would wreck the other side…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big bro, what happened?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even Ye-zi wrecked him, you still got killed even when you are an item ahead?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The entire dorm mocked Kang Peng, while a round of laughter sounded out in the booster team’s voice chat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Goddess is back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Booster Goddess also smiled a bit. Like she thought, how could she, a Master, be unable to defeat the other side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She just had been careless early on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After that, Booster Goddess solo-killed Kang Peng’s Riven four more times. The entire dorm groaned, while Kang Peng also got angry, as he swore while pushing his keyboard to the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck, the other side is definitely an elo booster.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How about I give it a go?” Ye Zichen got a bit excited, he clearly felt that the speed of his hands and his reaction speed had improved greatly when he was playing Riven just now</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was obvious that the Body Enhancing Pill was taking effect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then give it a shot.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kang Peng’s mood was sullen, so he just decided to let Ye Zichen play for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Goddess, what happened again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within a minute of Ye Zichen playing, he directly killed Fiora.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“An accident.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, before a minute has passed, when the Booster Goddess had just reached the lane…</span></p>
 <p><span style>She died again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Like this, Ye Zichen killed the Booster Goddess a few more times, then went to help mid and bot a few times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Solo-top Riven became their dear papa.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then the game ended.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen essentially carried the entire game by himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If you had to say it in one phrase, it would be a god carrying four trolls.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the game ended, the amazing score showed everything, and Kang Peng got crushed by the other side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter how dumb everyone was, they could guess that Ye Zichen was truly good, and the other side definitely wasn’t being piloted by a noob.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“C’mon, start another game. Ye-zi, continue playing top.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Coincidentally…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the booster team lost, no one blamed the Booster Goddess, they merely thought that the goddess was not in her proper conditions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They cheered each other up in voice chat a bit, then started another game.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We crashed, it’s them again…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Room 2016 and the booster team said at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So what if we crashed, let’s wreck them…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was completely confident in his capabilities.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, the Booster Goddess also smiled when she saw Ye Zichen’s number.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, she was still top. She played Irelia, who was definitely a strong champion in this patch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen used Pantheon. If there was no surprises, then he would definitely get wrecked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I must wash away the shame from the previous game!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Booster Goddess silently swore in her heart. She directly started off with Doran’s Blade. What surprised people was that Ye Zichen’s Pantheon did the same.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A fight between powerhouses must have a death….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes, the Booster Goddess was wrecked by Ye Zichen once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen carried his team to victory was again, while the Booster Goddess, who was wrecked twice, directly said in voice chat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not playing anymore. I’m not in the proper condition, find someone else to carry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, she quit the voice chat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she looked at her pitiful score, she clenched her teeth and chose to add Ye Zichen as a friend.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Friend has sent a friend request.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Accept.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: What, you want to curse me?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Friend: Do you dare to tell me your WeChat? I feel like you hacked, I want to solo you offline.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: You’re so childish? What? You want to pretend to be a mob on the internet now?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Friend: I’m just asking if you dare!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Nope!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After sending that, Ye Zichen directly deleted the Booster Goddess as friend and added her to the ignore list.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did he say to you just now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kang Peng asked curiously, while Ye Zichen rolled his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Idiot wants to solo me offline, I can tell that he’s underaged, so I just ignored him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, that’s pretty dumb. Play a bit more?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Play your ass, just what time is it? Let’s sleep.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pushed the keyboard to the side, then jumped into his bed to lie down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Ye Zichen did that, at the same time, in a certain girl’s dorm in Polytechnic University…</span></p>
 <p><span style>A very sweet-looking girl with a bit of baby fat sat cross-legged on a chair and looked at the account that disappeared from her friend list, as well as the conversation that she didn’t close…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is pissing me off, pissing me off…”</span></p>
