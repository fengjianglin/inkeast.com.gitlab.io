 <p><span style>Chapter 730 – Heavenly Court Blacklist</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master, I’ve already told you everything I know.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Qinguang replied sincerely on the screen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled as he scrolled through the series of messages.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was exactly as he expected.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Very well, I’ll let you back into the group now. I won’t disappoint you if you work hard for me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Qinguang has joined the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Qinguang has been set as an admin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The deities in the group naturally congratulated King Qinguang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the meantime, Ye Zichen did not say anything in the group. He merely continued to ponder about what Heavenly King Li and King Qinguang told him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Customer, all of the dishes you ordered have arrived.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The waiter placed the final dish onto the table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Flame Emperor waved his hand in front of Ye Zichen’s face. “The stuff you ordered.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s not eat anything. I’ve already gotten information on the ley line. Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But the food…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t eat it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen dragged Flame Emperor away, but not before the latter grabbing a slice of beef and throwing it into his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, the waiter chased after them, “Customers, you didn’t pay yet!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoosh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A bag of money fell into the waiter’s hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Keep the change!” Ye Zichen called out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But that’s my money!” Flame Emperor cursed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Flame Emperor was in a bad mood ever since Ye Zichen snatched his bag of money. Although he was one of the most important people in the Immortal Region, he didn’t have any actual income.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The several thousand celeste Ye Zichen took was all he had saved up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop it with that dark look. Who the heck owes you money right now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You!” Flame Emperor just rolled his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, it’s just a bit of celeste. I’ll get Zuo Mo to pay you back tenfold when we return. You know about the Treasure Tower, right? The Zuo Mo I mentioned is the young mistress of the Treasure Tower. She’s damn rich!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you for real?” Flame Emperor’s eyes lit up. He had heard of the Treasure Tower in the outer areas of the Immortal Region.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He knew that they were very rich!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just look at what sort of face you have right now!” Ye Zichen shook his head speechlessly. He could not comprehend why he became such good friends with a guy so obsessed with money.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Flame Emperor’s mood improved drastically when he heard that he would get compensated ten times the amount he had lost.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he glanced in front of him, he suddenly stopped in his tracks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’re going to the Heavenly Court?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The South Heaven’s Gate was clearly in front of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, we’re searching for the ley line! Where else are we supposed to go? The Underworld?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then aren’t you saying that the one who took it away was the Jade Emperor?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You thought of that yourself, I didn’t say anything,” Ye Zichen smirked. “I’m merely investigating. I’m not certain that the Jade Emperor has the ley line.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He’s still pretending?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Flame Emperor was already very wise after living for so long.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It didn’t matter if Ye Zichen didn’t admit that the ley line was in the Heavenly Court, that was clearly what Ye Zichen had tried to express.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Flame Emperor could not understand why the Jade Emperor stole the ley line.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Another thing that he couldn’t understand why the ley line couldn’t be sensed from the Immortal Region since it is in the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop thinking about it. You won’t think of anything with your level of intelligence,” Ye Zichen patted Flame Emperor’s shoulder, then strode over to the South Heaven’s Gate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are you? This is the South Heaven’s Gate. If you are irrelevant personnel, then take your leave now!” The guards glared seriously at Ye Zichen and Flame Emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zezeze, you must be new to not know me. I am Sky Sovereign Nameless, the Chancellor of the Grand Secretariat, so scuttle off. I have business with the Jade Emperor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He waved his hands towards the guards, then continued walking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, the guard stopped him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you Only Idealism?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Indeed!” Ye Zichen puffed up his chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then, I’m very sorry. You are now blacklisted from the Heavenly Court by the decree of the Jade Emperor,” a guard said bluntly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That old geezer...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shook his head. </span><i><span style>He really had everything planned out.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But… This is basically just telling us that he did it!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What do we do now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Flame Emperor was also certain now that the ley line was with the Jade Emperor. There was no other reason for him to blacklist Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked at Flame Emperor confidently then smiled towards the guards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I won’t go in. You won’t have any issues with me staying here, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Erhm…” the guards frowned. </span><i><span style>The Jade Emperor did not say that he can’t stay here though… </span></i><span style>“Of course.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, then go back to your work.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>These Heavenly Soldiers did not dare to go and do anything else. They had to keep a close watch on the number one of the blacklist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They could not afford to endure the consequences of letting him sneak in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen did not mind. He merely took his phone out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“@everyone. This Sovereign is at the South Heaven’s Gate now. Would anyone like to come and welcome me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: Sky Sovereign’s at the Heavenly Court? This old pig’s coming right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Same same.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen (Admin): Bro, you should have told me earlier. I’ll come and get you now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nezha: Then I’ll come too.</span></p>
 <p><span style>More than half of the deities in the group offered to come and welcome him, so upon seeing that, Ye Zichen chose a few that he was more familiar with to come instead to prevent a sudden panic As for the rest, he said that he would visit them all while he was in the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Done.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Done?” Flame Emperor was very confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ll see.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon after, a huge figure appeared at the South Heaven’s Gate. The pair looked over, it was Canopy Marshal, the first one to reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Marshal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Canopy Marshal was definitely a great deity, so all the Heavenly Soldiers saluted him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal nodded, then walked out of the South Heaven’s Gate towards Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You came pretty quickly,” Ye Zichen smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Although this old pig is fat, I’m not slow. I saw that stick God of Thunder giving orders to his subordinates hurrying up when he saw me. He should be here soon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did I hear someone talk about me behind my back from miles away?” God of Thunder flapped his wings and flew over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Heavenly Soldiers quickly greeted him as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I thought you would need to give commands for at least an hour.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whatever,” God of Thunder twitched his mouth, then turned to Ye Zichen. “Sky Sovereign.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm.” Ye Zichen nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, I’m here!” At that moment, Yang Jian flew over alongside Nezha, God of Fortune, Yue Lao and Old Lord Taishang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pretty much all the deities close to Ye Zichen had arrived.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Heavenly Soldiers were beyond excited!</span></p>
 <p><span style>These great deities that they normally won’t even get a glimpse of in six months had all arrived!</span></p>
