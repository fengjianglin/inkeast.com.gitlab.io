 <p><span style>Chapter 668 – Retreat in order to advance</span></p>
 <p><span style>The white-robed man’s words immediately made Ye Zichen realize that everything wasn’t as simple as he thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked towards the white-robed man in confusion. However, before he could speak up, Fatty Yin chuckled, “Do you really think that he would allow the Three Realms to fight amongst themselves?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then…” Ye Zichen hesitated for a moment. Judging from the chat just now, it was clear that they were fighting.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Otherwise, the Jade Emperor wouldn’t have gathered the great emperors of the four directions and told Yang Jian and co. to move out.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop hesitating and worrying. With this guy here, the Three Realms won’t actually start fighting,” Fatty Yin patted Ye Zichen’s shoulder as he spoke mysteriously with a smile. “But this guy has seriously tired me out. I’ve been running around doing errands for him, so much so that my legs are turning into sticks.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on? Can you tell me so that I can stop worrying?” Ye Zichen frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The white-robed man smile, “You’ll understand when the time comes. Alright, let’s wait for this girl’s blessing to end. She might even be able to give the demons a surprise.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened?” Lord Black Dragon looked at Su Yiyun and co. with a frown. He already noticed that something he didn’t know about definitely happened between them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun maintained his cold and silent look, while Qiu Hai was his senior from the Demon Realm, so Black Dragon did not dare to ask him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, he set his gaze upon Gu Li, then interrogated, “Gu Li, you explain.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lord Black Dragon, you truly know how to trouble someone,” Gu Li pursed his lips and smiled, then swept his gaze meaningfully over Su Yiyun and Qiu Hai. “You told me to bring Senior back, so I did. I don’t know anything else.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t want to say it?” Black Dragon said darkly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, it’s just that I don’t dare. I have always valued my life. I had better stay silent at times like this, otherwise, what will I do about my fragile life if I offend someone?” Gu Li smiled. Anyone could tell that he was signaling to someone in the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then are you not afraid of offending me?” the moment Black Dragon said that, an apologetic smile surfaced on Gu Li’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lord Black Dragon, you might not like to hear me say this, but… I really am not worried about you. Although I’m just a small fry in the Demon Realm. You… can’t really do anything about me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gu Li, that’s simply too much!” one of the Twelve Demon Sovereigns said angrily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Li looked in his direction, then picked his ear, while his gaze turned menacing, “You’re seeking death!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The one who had spoken up instantly fell down, while a spot on his chest turned blackened and charred.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You really think too much of yourself. Yet, you’re nothing in my eyes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The demon sovereign’s expression was filled with shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Li smiled, then hooked his arm around Su Yiyun’s shoulder, “What do you think about my performance?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh,” Su Yiyun chuckled coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The rest of the Demon Sovereigns stepped forward, while Gu Li looked at them provokingly with a smile, “What? You want to fight me here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gu Li, that’s enough!” Su Yiyun said calmly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Li shrugged, “They did it first. Master Su, you should be on my side. You know, in some ways, you are on the same side.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I said enough!” Su Yiyun’s tone radiated his impatience. He turned towards Black Dragon and bowed deeply. “Lord Black Dragon, I ask for punishment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The scene had put Black Dragon in a rather terrible mood. He was always the cautious type, so he would think about a lot of things just from small hints.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Li’s resistance and words instantly caused Black Dragon to become a lot more wary of Su Yiyun and Gu Li.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master Su, why would you do so?” Black Dragon asked in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have always hidden something from you. Although I belong to the Demon Realm, I am still unable to put my past behind me. One example would be the Yellow Emperor you’ve been wanting to capture,” Su Yiyun’s words shocked everyone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Min’e opened her eyes wide upon hearing those words.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s he saying that? That’s just seeking death!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Li Min’e quickly ran over to Su Yiyun’s side, then bowed towards Black Dragon apologetically. “Lord Black Dragon, Yiyun has been rather tired from all the formation research. Please don’t mind what he just said.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Min’e, no need to defend me,” Su Yiyun grabbed Li Min’e by her arm and shook his head before dragging her behind him. Then, he turned back towards Black Dragon. “Lord Black Dragon, I, Su Yiyun, will never act as a petty villain. Ye Zichen is my brother, I can’t possibly forget about it. I won’t deny that everything I did before was just a façade. All of the curses and damage I did to him, those were all me trying to protect him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master Su, do you know what you’re saying?” Black Dragon’s gaze turned even more dark, while clenching his fists.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know exactly what I’m saying, but Lord Black Dragon has been very nice to me. I don’t want to hide it from you. Actually, Senior Qiu Hai and I met Ye Zichen in the Valley of Death just now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why was he there?” Black Dragon was greatly confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, why? I didn’t expect him to be there either. Gu Li wanted senior Qiu Hai to capture him, but Ye Zichen is my dear friend, I didn’t want to see him harmed, so I let him go. That’s what you wanted to hear about. Su Yiyun maintained a calm expression. “That’s my betrayal towards the Demon Realm. I won’t deny that. I have returned to put an end to all that .If you are willing to continue to take me in, then I, Su Yiyun, will do everything in my ability to help you. If you want to execute me, then do it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Su Yiyun put down his guard, closed his eyes, while he let his hands fall to his sides.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Min’e’s face was instantly covered in nervousness. The moment Su Yiyun finished, she started to defend him. “Lord Black Dragon, Su Yiyun definitely has no intention of betraying the Demon Realm. He just treasures his relationships a lot, but isn’t that what you admire about him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>To everybody’s surprise, even the other Demon Sovereigns and demons in high positions began to do the same as Li Min’e.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lord Su is of great use to the Demon Realm. Please have mercy on him due to everything he has accomplished before.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, that was of no use, since the final decision rested on Black Dragon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unbeknownst to all, Gu Li was on the verge of breaking down in laughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He nodded in his head repeatedly, and silently praised Su Yiyun.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That was close. I didn’t expect this guy who has nothing special about him, to actually be capable on such moves.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Retreat in order to advance. That’s impressive!</span></i></p>
