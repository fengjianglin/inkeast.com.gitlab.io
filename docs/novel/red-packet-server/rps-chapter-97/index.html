 <p><span style>Chapter 97 – Supermarket Spokesperson Selection</span></p>
 <p><span style>The deities within the group already started to chatter immediately after the chat group had been created.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: Who dragged Old Sun into this group??</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Damned monkey, why are you here?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: Monkey bro!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: Idiot, why did you come as well?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha: Why are you guys here?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang: Can you guys pay attention in the conference? Do you want the annual bonus?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: What’s going on?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen became truly speechless when he saw these deities chat.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Were they really in a conference?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Both the Monkey King and Erlang Shen started arguing immediately after seeing each other, as usual. Although the Third Prince Nezha wanted to convince them to stop, when he saw that he couldn’t interrupt, he gave up on that idea.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Old Lord Taishang and Yue Lao directly treated it as a private chatroom and started discussing who is most likely to get the annual prize at the conference this year.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But it was good, at least the people he dragged in were all alive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen changed the name of the chat group to “Supermarket Spokesperson Selection”, then sent a message to the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cough, cough, everybody stop for a moment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone in the group instantly stopped the moment Ye Zichen spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But it heated up again after a brief period of calm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Bro, why are you here?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: You dragged Old Sun in?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: Great deity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha: Celestial Sovereign.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang: It’s actually celestial friend.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: What did celestial friend gathered us for?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could they not see who invited them into the group? Why were they so shocked?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen suppressed the retorts in his heart and said, “I have something to discuss with you guys.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen could definitely not let go of the business opportunity he had found in the Heavenly Court. There were so many treasures that were waiting to be bought.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He must start his business in the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But that would require an opportunity to sell it.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What were sales reliant on now?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>The celebrity effect!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Basically, he needed a spokesperson.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Ye Zichen wasn’t wrong about it, then the six of them in his group had absolute authority in the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Especially the Canopy Marshal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was definitely number one in the Heavenly Court when it came to food.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, Ye Zichen decided to…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Turn them all into his…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Spokespeople!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen thought for a while as he saw the deities in the group speak up, then finally sent a message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everyone should know the situation of this sovereign at a secret location. You should also know that I have some treasures here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: I know, I know &lt;insert a row of saliva emojis&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: Celestial friend’s cigarettes are amazing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang: I know.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha: Nutri-express is so delicious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: Those are great treasures.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: The book that bro sent over is really great too.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of them have had a taste of what Ye Zichen had to offer, and he could tell that his treasures were pretty well received by these deities.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This sky sovereign wants to start selling these treasures in the Heavenly Court. I wonder if you are all willing to aid this sovereign?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Ye Zichen were worried that they were unwilling, he added.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s not for free. You’ll get compensation out of it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The group instantly exploded with the Canopy Marshal in the lead, who pestered Ye Zichen about what could they get.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Yue Lao and Old Lord Taishang were far more calm as they asked, “What do we need us to do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It’s simple, you guys only need to advertise this sovereign’s products in your circle of friends. I will create a chat group later on. When that happens, as long as people in your circle of friends are interested in this sovereign’s treasures, then you can add them into the group.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Each deity you invite grants you a shopping card with two thousand cultivation experience, at the same time, you will also be able to get a discount when you buy things from this sovereign. The more deities you invite into the group, the higher your discount will be.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone in the group turned silent the moment Ye Zichen sent the message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stared at the chat group nervously. He’ll be screwed if he doesn’t succeed when he took the initiative like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he failed here, then it would be rather troublesome to sell to the Heavenly Court in the future.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, if he succeeded, then the profits he gained would definitely be far better than him slowly advertising himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: You’re too terrible, you want Old Sun to pay? Old Sun doesn’t get a salary from the Heavenly Court, nor am I as rich as the God of Fortune.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang: Bro, you should know I’m terribly poor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha: My pocket money is all with my dad.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy General: Celestial Sovereign, I don’t think it would work that well. The people in the Heavenly Court aren’t particularly rich.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately slapped himself after seeing their reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was too concentrated on brainwashing them that he actually forgot to tell them the transaction method. From the looks of it, they probably subconsciously thought that they needed to pay with money from the Heavenly Court…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This sovereign’s items don’t require the Heavenly Court’s money, they require cultivation experience. At the same time, item exchanges are possible as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: Cultivation experience. What do you want such a useless thing for?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Bro, could it be that you’re about to breakthrough, so you need more cultivation experience to do so?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Was cultivation experience not important in the Heavenly Court? From their tons, it seemed like cultivation experience was like cabbage, and they had however much that he wanted. Yue Lao had said that cultivation experience was very important, when he just entered the group, the God of Thunder managed to get a thousand-cultivation experience and invoked envy among people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What Ye Zichen did not know was that the Heavenly Court had been established for a long time…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cultivation experience was way too common for these deities.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But that’s good that they didn’t need it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen did.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This sovereign does need cultivation to breakthrough, I wonder if my celestial friends could give this sovereign a hand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Sheng: Since bro is in trouble, then I’ll naturally help.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha: Sure, dad taught me to find joy in people since a young age.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: This little deity would definitely aid with all his might since the great deity has asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: No problem.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang: Okay.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: Then shouldn’t you show some good will first!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first few deities were rather just, but when it came to the Monkey King…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Show some good will!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He only knew how to get benefits.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But no matter, he naturally needed to give them products in order to be his spokespeople and advertise his products in their circle of friends.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Didn’t Coca Cola give out free coke when it first started?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Wool comes from sheep, just like cultivation experience from the deities. By giving them some benefits, Ye Zichen had no fear of them not buying things from him in the future.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s for sure. Celestial friends, you should still be in the conference, continue with that for now. I’ll send you all treasures when it is finished. I’ll be troubling my celestial friends then.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure sure.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen closed the chat group and called Su Yiyun as the deities replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He must get the supermarket set up quickly. Time waits for no man, deity or not. Ye Zichen did want those deities to advertise his products a bit when the conference ended.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen simply hurried Su Yiyun a bit, then hung up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, his mood could be described in only one word.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Which was…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Amazing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was a bit excited just as he thought about the deities coming to buy stuff from him, and letting him earn cultivation experience at a crazy rate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What that happens, who cares if it was the Fiery Eyes of Truth or Body Freezing Technique…</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was one book or two books in the face of his plan?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He would buy all of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Don’t ask why. When he has a lot of cultivation experience, he could spend it to his liking.</span></p>
