 <p><span style>Chapter 406 – Awkward Birthday Party</span></p>
 <p><span style>The atmosphere at the dinner table sudden turned cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked up at the woman with thick makeup, and noticed that everyone else at the table turned their gaze towards him. Then, he saw the faint smile on the woman’s lips…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could I have been too loud, so she heard me?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you guys talking about?” Su Yiyun asked in confusion. Ye Zichen instantly squinted his eyes…</span></p>
 <p><span style>In terms of proximity, Su Yiyun was actually closer to him, </span><i><span style>but even he didn’t hear it, so how could the woman have possibly heard it?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Fiery Eyes of Truth, activate!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked toward the woman with faint golden eyes. All of a sudden, the elderly man beside her stood up and waved his right hand forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen instantly noticed that a glass-like barrier separated him and the woman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We came here to celebrate Min’e’s birthday. Everybody, calm down,” the old man said with a hint of authority in his voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman opposite Ye Zichen also nodded with a smile, “Yeah, I did come for our Min’e’s birthday. I don’t want to ruin the mood because of someone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s this? We’re all friends here, why speak so enigmatically?” Su Yiyun also stood up, then twitched his mouth. “Don’t bully my brother just because there are more of you. Calm down? I think that you guys are the ones who should calm down… Hmm?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun knitted his eyebrows closely towards, then snorted coldly as he swept his gaze across everybody’s face. “I don’t want to care since I’m giving face to Min’e, but if you guys want to make my brother uncomfortable, then I won’t let you guys be comfortable!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the atmosphere at the table got more and more awkward, the old man twitched his mouth and snorted with a hint of disdain, “Min’e, your boyfriend has a pretty huge temper. Speaking to us as if he’s lecturing… What? Do we need to be educated by him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All of you shut up!” Li Min’e suddenly slammed the table and pointed at the woman with thick makeup. “If you didn’t try to seduce someone else’s boyfriend from the very beginning, would all this happen? I didn’t invite you guys for this birthday party either. You guys just came shamelessly. Can you guys calm down? If you can’t, then just go back, okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay, everybody quiet down a bit,” the young man opposite Li Min’e suddenly raised his hand. Everyone else at the table instantly turned quiet… “Min’e, we came to celebrate to make you happy. There is no need to make everyone unhappy, right? Let’s leave this at that. Give face to big brother, okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Min’e twitched her mouth and sat back down, then dipped her head with a pout and stopped speaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man also turned to smile apologetically at Ye Zichen and Su Yiyun, then snapped his fingers, “Start bringing us the dishes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, the birthday party was rather uninteresting. The atmosphere on the table remained suppressed to the max, and it ended prematurely before even blowing out the candles on the cake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When everyone begun to leave, the woman with thick makeup intentionally walked in front of Ye Zichen and stuck her tongue out seductively. “Hmmph, I feel like you’re blind. I seem to be so much better than that innocent girly beside you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hua Kui!” Li Min’e scolded angrily with a frown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman instantly shrugged with a raise of her eyebrows, “Fine, fine, fine. I won’t say anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, she left with the others as she swung her hips left and right. Meanwhile, Ye Zichen, Su Yiyun, Su Yan and Li Min’e stood at the hotel entrance and watched the others leave in black MPVs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Min’e, what sort of friends are these?” Su Yiyun frowned. He nearly exploded in rage with his young master temper.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry, I know them from when I was working a summer job. I have no idea how they knew that it was my birthday, but they all came over,” Li Min’e’s face was filled with a pitiful and apologetic look. She walked in front of Su Yan, held her hands and shook it left and right. “Susu, don’t be unhappy, Hua Kui just likes to tease men… I’ll call and scold her later.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sis, how could I get angry!” Su Yan smiled, then raised her eyebrows. “I’m just worried if that guy being unable to hold it…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She glanced over at Ye Zichen, who was walking with Su Yiyun as they had their arm around each other’s shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen set up a barrier around the two of them, licked his lips and glanced behind them, “Ol’ Su, your little girlfriend is not so simple.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can sort of feel it,” Su Yiyun nodded. “None of those guys at the table just now were normal people, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm, they are at the very least stronger than me,” Ye Zichen nodded</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun’s pupils contracted, “There’s no helping it. I just like her. We’ll see. If it really doesn’t work, then I’ll pull out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm, my phone’s on twenty-four hours a day. Remember to directly call me if you get into any sort of danger.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They looked at each other with a smile, then Ye Zichen proceeded to disperse the surrounding barrier and walked towards Su Yan and Li Min’e.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you two men whispering for? What did you just talk about?” Li Min’e smirked and asked coquettishly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun smiled, “Ye-zi wanted to take me to see the elephants, so he asked me if I had time. I naturally rejected him justly since I’m such a proper person… But this grandson, Ye Zichen, was so sad, he actually wanted to move me emotionally in order to make me change my mind. That’s why the two of us argued for so long.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What a shitty teammate!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen already noticed the change in the way Su Yan looked towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Li Min’e raised her eyebrows innocently, “What’s seeing the elephant?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t know what seeing the elephant is? It’s blah blah blah…” As Su Yiyun explained, he made sure to gesture it out along with some sound effects. This only caused the way Su Yan looked towards Ye Zichen to become even weirder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In order to prevent the situation from getting even worse, Ye Zichen scratched his hand, “Alright, hurry up and leave you two. I’m going to send Su Yan back too, so let’s part here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen held Su Yan’s hand as they got into the car. Immediately after they climbed in, Su Yan stared straight at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Feeling uncomfortable, Ye Zichen smiled coyly, “What are you looking at me like that for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you really lack women right now?” Su Yan said indifferently.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Like I thought, she’s bothered about what Su Yiyun said just now. That brat is seriously… a great person a screwing up friends.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Your brother was kidding just now, don’t take it seriously, I’m not that sort of person,” Ye Zichen explained with a coy smile as he pondered about what to say next.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Su Yan merely nodded with a smile, “It’s okay, I can understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan replied plainly, then bit her lips, “But going to that sort of place is no good. If you really lack a woman by your side… Then I can sleep with you tonight.”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Original Chapter Teaser:</b>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Ol' Three, I know you called me over to your girl's birthday party, but... Who are these people?</p>
 <p><strong>Su Yiyun:&nbsp;</strong>I'll be honest dude, I have no idea.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Then why are they here?</p>
 <p><strong>Su Yiyun:&nbsp;</strong>She said they are her friends.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Friends...? Uhm... You do realize that these people are of many different ages right? Also, they look really shifty.</p>
 <p><strong>Su Yiyun:&nbsp;</strong>Yeah, they really do. Do you also feel a sort of oppressing aura from them?</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen: </strong>Yeah. They are at least as strong as me, if not stronger. Do be careful, the fact that Li Min'e knows these people... There might be more to her than what she's showing...</p>
