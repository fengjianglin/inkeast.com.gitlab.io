 <p><span style>Chapter 200 – The Spicy Gluten Loving Fairy, Chang’e</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within the Moon Palace of the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chang’e sat, staring blankly out the window lost in her thoughts as she held the Jade Rabbit close.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Anyone could tell from her eyes that she was not paying attention to the scenery outside. She was pondering, and reminiscing…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve been in the Heavenly Court for thousands of years, yet it seems to be just a blink of an eye,” Chang’e’s beautiful hand caressed the Jade Rabbit. At that moment, Jade Rabbit jumped down from her arms, then turned into a cute girl with a bit of baby fat on her cheeks, who looked to be around seventeen or eighteen years old.</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>“Jiejie, are you thinking about Houyi-gege<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> again?”</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>“How could I not?” Chang’e said with a sense of loss. “Houyi clearly asked for two celestial pills, yet I swallowed both. We haven’t met for thousands of years… Ai… What’s more, since I’m not good at socializing in the Heavenly Court and the Queen Mother doesn’t allow me to take a single step outside of the Moon Palace… I’m lonely!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm, Jiejie, don’t be sad. Bunny will go and get spicy gluten for you,” Jade Rabbit hopped to her room, then hopped back with drooping ears a short while later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jiejie, there’s no more spicy gluten!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? There’s no more spicy gluten!?” Chang’e stood up from the chair, while her quiet ladylike appearance had completely disappeared. “I clearly got five packs from Lord Yue Lao. Every time I want to eat some, I would just eat one… Tell me… You ate them, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uhm…” Jade Rabbit lowered her head and twiddled her thumbs without replying…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Serious…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chang’e’s phone rang, she subconsciously looked over to where it sat by the window.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was most likely Wu Gang, who was chopping wood, that had sent her a message on WeChat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jiejie, your phone rang,” Jade Rabbit stuck out her tongue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chang’e frowned, “Ignore it, tell me the truth, did you eat them…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jiejie, I’ll go and get your phone for you. Hehe…” Chang’e was angry, yet she wanted to laugh when she saw Jade Rabbit’s cute face that was clearly displaying her guilt…</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it wasn’t for this little cutie accompanying her, she might not had been able to survive in the Moon Palace.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>But…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>This is spicy gluten that we’re talking about!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Spicy gluten!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Jiejie, jiejie, it was Sky Sovereign! He sent you a friend request!’ Jade Rabbit skipped over with the phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chang’e was stunned momentarily, before raising her eyebrows, “Sky Sovereign? Which Sky Sovereign?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s the super amazing Sky Sovereign,” Jade Rabbit skipped over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chang’e received the phone with suspicion. When she saw the message…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Spicy gluten!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Spicy gluten!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Spicy gluten!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Chang’e muttered to herself, then quickly accepted the friend request.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, I’m here!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who was looking through his WeChat Moments felt his phone vibrate. When he closed the Moments, he saw that his friend request to Chang’e had been accepted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first thing he did was look at the intimacy level.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>150.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Friendly.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>That’s kinda weird. Normally, all of the accepted friend requests are at 100.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But it’s whatever as long as it is at least Friendly.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Fairy Chang’e, I wonder what you are busying yourself with?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chang’e, who was within the Moon Palace, was stunned when she saw the message…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Did Celestial Sovereign’s words mean that he was going to confess?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Previously, anyone that said this to me would always confess afterwards.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Houyi is my beloved in my heart, but Sky Sovereign has spicy gluten…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It was a struggle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her heart continuously struggled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, she finally suppressed her thoughts and clenched her teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m sewing…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She didn’t know why she replied like that, thinking back…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>In the fight between spicy gluten and Houyi, spicy gluten won.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>When he saw Chang’e’s message, Ye Zichen specifically got Liu Jing to have a look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as if he was telling her…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Look at her, she’s sewing!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Look at you, you’re reading ero-doujins!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Jing rolled her eyes at him, then ignored him. At the same time, Ye Zichen also sent his reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fairy Chang’e is truly is in a good mood.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s alright.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chang’e’s heart raced like a fawn, while Jade Rabbit stood on the side with her ears standing up straight.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Spicy gluten!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>This sky sovereign has spicy gluten.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I wonder what Sky Sovereign sought this lady out so late in the night for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ba-thump.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ba-thump.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chang’e was truly nervous to the core. </span><i><span style>If Sky Sovereign truly confesses, how should I reply?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Reject?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Not reject?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Actually, this sovereign sought out this fairy to say something!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, please.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chang’e’s felt like her heart was going to explode. She struggled really hard in her heart…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to ask Fairy for some rootless water from outside the Moon Palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pa.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chang’e’s phone fell onto the jade bed.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Sky Sovereign didn’t want to confess to me.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Spicy gluten was… gone!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Chang’e’s nervous mood turned into depression. She lifelessly picked up the phone, then saw another message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, this sovereign would not ask for it without giving anything in return. Fairy can tell this sovereign what you would want!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want spicy gluten!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chang’e pretty much replied on reflex. However, she begun to regret it not long after.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Image.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Her image…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who was lying on the bed, was also completely shocked.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>She wanted spicy gluten.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>This Fairy Chang’e truly has an intricate taste. She didn’t want stuff like Nutri-Express or Wahaha, she only wanted spicy gluten.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, as long as Fairy gives me rootless water, then you’ll get enough spicy gluten!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chang’e, who was within the Moon Palace laughed and nearly jumped up in happiness. Jade Rabbit, who was peeking at Chang’s phone behind her quickly ran out as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, she struggled to bring in a huge bucket of rootless water.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jiejie, I brought the rootless water.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This little Jade Rabbit was also a crazy fan of spicy gluten.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chang’e raised her thumb towards the little Jade Rabbit. However, she didn’t send the rootless water immediately. In order to correct her image, she replied with her own defense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, actually, it’s my Jade Rabbit that likes to eat it, that’s why I…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood, this Sky Sovereign will not tell others. About the rootless water?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll send it right now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within 30 seconds, a red packet appeared on Ye Zichen’s phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received Chang’e’s red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rootless water x30 liters</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>She sent so much?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It seems like rootless water wasn’t anything rare over at her side.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Rootless Water: A necessary material for mortals to forge a celestial body. Currently, it is mostly used as bathing water in the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The difference between the mortal realm and the Heavenly Court was instantly shown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen noticed an issue. Most of what is required for Liu Qing’s revival was used for forging a celestial body.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Did that mean that Liu Qing would have a celestial body after she is revived?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen subconsciously glanced towards Liu Qing. </span><i><span style>If it really was like that, then this little girl was going to be the carry.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, I have already sent you the rootless water!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that Ye Zichen did not reply for quite a while, Chang’e couldn’t help but send another message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but smile when he saw it.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It was way too easy to understand her thoughts, right?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“This sovereign has already received it. As for the spicy gluten, this sovereign needs to send it over to Fairy later. Right now, this sovereign is not in the secret location…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay, this lady will just wait.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need to worry, from now on, all the Moon Palace’s spicy gluten is on this sovereign.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wow!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Chang’e jumped up when she saw this message and hugged Jade Rabbit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Jade, we’re going to be happy!”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Original Chapter Teaser:[expand]</strong></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>(mutters) We're at Chapter 200 now... Hmmm, what's going to happen? Well, Chang'e was mentioned last chapter, and she's a fairy... AM I GOING TO GET HER TO FALL IN LOVE WITH ME!?</p>
 <p><b>Liu Qing:&nbsp;</b>What's with that lecherous look on your face?</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Be a good little ghost girl and stay put, I'm...</p>
 <p><b>Liu Qing:&nbsp;</b>You're going to chat up another girl aren't you? Who is it this time? Since you already chatted up a ghost and plenty of people... Perhaps a goddess? Someone from the Heavenly Court?</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>(gasps) How did you know!!! Actually, wait a second, I don't care about her, I just want some rootless water from outside the Moon Palace. Don't slander me! I need to keep my image and reputation good after all.</p>
 <p><strong>Liu Qing:&nbsp;</strong>... What image?</p>
