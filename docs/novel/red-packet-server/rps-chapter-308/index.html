 <p><span style>Chapter 308 – Great Dao of Heaven’s Birth</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was slightly shocked when he saw Erlang Shen’s message, but he still quickly replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s happened?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, he still did not see Erlang Shen’s response after a long wait.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Feeling worried, Ye Zichen suddenly thought of the secret scripture in his Treasure Chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Great Dao of Heaven’s Birth!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Withdraw.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Would you like to learn the Great Dao of Heaven’s Birth?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An astronomical amount of information surge into Ye Zichen’s brain, causing him to be completely stunned for quite a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he finally came back to himself, he raised his eyebrows and called out silently in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Great Dao of Heaven’s Birth, activate!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Activating Great Dao of Heaven’s Birth requires a large amount of cultivation experience, do you wish to proceed?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Please select the target for activation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>True Lord Erlang Yang Jian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A small window of an image appeared in front of Ye Zichen’s eyes, which displayed an wasteland without anyone in sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, he was also able to hear some levels of squabbling…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Monkey… Just… Wait!” Erlang Shen’s face was covered in bruises, while the Howling Celestial Dog laid on the ground with its tongue out as if it was going to die.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, my son, do you submit after fighting your grandpa Sun!?” Great Sage Sun stood on a huge boulder and held out his Jingu Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had already fought for three thousand rounds merely for the grudges derived from the events that occurred during Yue Lao’s new show.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One would definitely not think that Erlang Shen was merely single-handedly getting beaten up. He wasn’t the captain of security in the Heavenly Court for nothing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Monkey King also lost many patches of fur, while his hair was slightly scorched as smoke arose from it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe… Laozi can’t be bothered with you,” Erlang Shen squinted his eyes and took a step back. “This was a draw at most, do you understand?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My son, you still dare to act cocky with your Grandpa Sun!?” The Great Sage swung down with his Jingu Bang, causing Erlang Shen to hurriedly raise his lance…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A huge sound reverberated across the wasteland, and the vibrations from the lance caused Erlang Shen to drop it to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck this, monkey, you aren’t doing things logically. Laozi isn’t going to play with you!” Erlang Shen beckoned towards the lance, then shouted towards the Howling Celestial Dog. “Howling Celestial Dog, bite him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck you,” the Howling Celestial Dog, who laid on the ground, suddenly retorted with human speech. “I told you before coming here to not fight the Great Sage and again to not fight the Great Sage. You just refused to listen! That’s great now isn’t it? We’ve both been beaten up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But he didn’t get beaten up!” Erlang Shen glared. “Are you throwing a tantrum at me right now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So what?” the Howling Celestial Dog stood up from the ground with a wobble and morphed into a long-haired man as he cursed. “Just look at what I’m like right now. You’re still telling me to go and bite him!? I’ll f*cking bite your grandma!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The image immediately turned towards the Howling Celestial Dog…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just how should I describe his condition? </span></i><span style>Ye Zichen thought about it for a long time, then concluded that he could only describe it as pitiful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not only was his face bruised, he even lost two teeth, while his clothes were even more tattered than the hobos who lived underneath overpasses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You barely got beaten up. Just look at how much that monkey beat me up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So what? Aren’t we bros!” Erlang Shen glared. “Shouldn’t you be happy when you got hurt for your bro?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you two done yet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A voice leisurely sounded out behind them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Great Sage appeared a meter away from them with the Jingu Bang in his hands, while his eyes flashed with a gold light…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Save the infighting for later, laozi…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sun Wukong plucked a monkey hair from his neck and blew on it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thousands among thousands of yellow monkeys suddenly appeared in the wasteland!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My kids, beat them up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen looked at the wave of monkeys in front of him, then thought about the lack of celestial spiritual energy due to the prior fighting with Sun Wukong…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He immediately shouted out, “Bro, save me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Save your ass. Kids, hit him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Great Sage took charge and ran forward. Erlang Shen wanted to resist, but he was unable to muster up any strength…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rumble.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thunder rolled across the wasteland. The Great Sage stopped at looked up, while the monkeys around him did the same.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think we can leave everything at this!” A voice sounded out from the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Great Sage squinted his eyes and snorted towards the sky, “Who are you? Stop hiding like a coward, come out and fight!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who sat on the sofa, shrunk his neck. </span><i><span style>Great Sage really does have a terrible temper. If I didn’t speak up just now, Erlang Shen really would have been beaten up.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Great Sage, give me face. Just stop fighting with Erlang Shen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, who’re you to ask I, Old Sun, to give you face? Even if this son’s real uncle, even if that geezer Jade Emperor came, I, Old Sun, would still give him the stick!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Great Sage lifted Jingu Bang with a dominating aura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The eyes of Erlang Shen, who was panting heavily on the ground, lit up, “Bro, that’s you, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s me,” Ye Zichen answered slightly dazedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he did not have the image conjured by the Great Dao of Heaven’s Birth, Ye Zichen would never believe that his jerk of a bro was actually such a noob…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He actually got beaten up by the Great Sage to this degree!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>And earlier, he even ask me confidently to wait for the news of his triumph return. This…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Who… Just who are you!” The Great Sage snorted with the stick in his hand. “If you are his bro, then come down and fight I, Old Sun!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“… I am Sky Sovereign Nameless!” Ye Zichen sighed.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Sky Sovereign Nameless.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, the Great Sage paused, then scratched his head, “Are you really Brother Nameless?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then how am I supposed to prove it? Does your stealing food at my secret location count?” Ye Zichen licked his lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Great Sage’s face immediately reddened as he chuckled, “You really are Brother Nameless!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Secret location?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen, who was laid out on the ground, raised his eyebrows, “Monkey, you went over to Brother Nameless’s?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“None of your business!” The Great Sage glared, then gave him a menacing look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen rolled his eyes, then went off to the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since Brother Nameless came to find I, Old Sun, then I, Old Sun, will give you face,” the Great Sage put away Jingu Bang and smiled. “Bro, how about you come down for us to have a chat?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“… Uhm… This sovereign is still in that secret location. I merely used the Laws of the World to talk with you guys. Both of you are good friends of this sovereign. This sovereign does not wish to see you guys like this. If there is a chance, then I think it is possible for the two of you to become friends!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Laws of the World?” Erlang Shen and the Great Sage were both shocked. “You have already started to understand the Laws of the World?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was surprised when he saw their shocked expressions. </span><i><span style>Could I have said something wrong?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Were the Laws of the World not easy to pry into?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, since he already said so, he could only continue, “I did gain some understandings of it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Amazing!” Erlang Shen raised his thumb towards the air, then chuckled. “Monkey, do you submit? My bro has already pried into the Laws of the World before reaching the complete stage of the Sky Immortal Stage. Take a look at yourself! You’ve already stayed at the early stage of the Sky Immortal level for ten thousand years… Embarrassing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You still dare to complain? Take this!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Monkey King waved Jingu Bang and smashed it towards Erlang Shen.</span></p>
