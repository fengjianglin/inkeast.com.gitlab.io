<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p><span style>Chapter 61 – The chance is here</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen opened the chat group and saw that most of the people inside were bragging. Ye Zichen typed out a message, hesitated for a moment, then deleted it without daring to send it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was afraid of being found out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was better to send his question through private message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clicked on his chat with Erlang Shen…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Bro, do you have anything that can increase the duration of a lifetime?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: How… Why would I have something like that. Those durations are merely for mortals, the lifetimes of us deities are eternal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen thought to himself, </span><i><span style>it truly was like that</span></i><span style>, when he read Erlang Shen’s reply, but he at least had to ask who would have something like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Then do you know who does?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: There shouldn’t be anyone in the Heavenly Court with something like this. However, the Peaches of Immortality from the Queen Mother’s Immortality Peach Garden’s are able to increase the duration of a mortal’s life time. If you really want one, the monkey should have some. If you want peaches, he’s definitely the one to go to.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Thanks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately opened his chat with the Monkey King after exiting the chat with Erlang Shen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Great Sage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: What business do you have with Old Sun? Did you get some good treasures again? &lt;insert a row of anticipation emojis&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled wryly, then typed on the screen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: This little deity has a request for Great Sage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: Go on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: I wonder if Great Sage has any Peaches of Immortality from the Immortality Peach Garden?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Silence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen felt a bit anxious when he saw that the Monkey King had suddenly stopped replying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Su needed the Peaches of Immortality to extend his life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a long time, the Monkey King finally replied with a message that turned Ye Zichen completely speechless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: How did you know that Old Sun has some Peaches of Immortality? Did the news of Old Sun stealing peaches get leaked?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The f*ck, he stole peaches again.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The Monkey King had stolen peaches from the Immortality Peach Garden in Journey to the West.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t think much of it when he was younger, but after growing up, everyone started to make fun of the Monkey King.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Who was the lamest person in Journey to the West!?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Answer: Sun Wukong.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As for the reason…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had managed to freeze the all fairies of the Immortality Peach Garden, but he didn’t do anything except going in to eat peaches!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thinking about that, Ye Zichen had a thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he could learn the Body Freezing Technique from the Great Sage…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zeze, then wouldn’t he be amazing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wait, no, his purpose was to ask for a Peach of Immortality.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen felt a bit shameless, so he couldn’t help but ask.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Did you freeze the fairy again?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: How did you know!? &lt;insert several shocked emojis&gt;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck, he’s truly lame!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen mocked the Monkey King several times in his heart. However, what the Monkey King had said did reveal that the Great Sage did indeed have Peaches of Immortality.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Don’t care about how this little deity found out. Great Sage, can you give this little deity a Peach of Immortality?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: Old Sun, I, didn’t steal much, this is a rare good.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The underlying meaning was that Ye Zichen should exchange for it with his ‘sincerity’.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Great Sage, this little deity needs the Peach of Immortality desperately. As for the item of exchange, wait for this little deity to go back before sending it to Great Sage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: Then what are you using to exchange for it?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Two rows of Wahaha.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: And two cup noodles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Deal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Monkey King sent a red packet over the moment he sent the news.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Damn.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>You received the Monkey King’s red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Peach of Immortality x1</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clicked open the Treasure Chest and read the Peach of Immortality’s effects.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Peach of Immortality: A 500 years old Peach of Immortality from the Queen Mother’s Immortality Peach Garden.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Effects: Improve health and lengthen lifespans. Increases lifetime by 20 years.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen finally stopped worrying after seeing that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He already found the thing he needed to increase a person’s lifetime, the remaining thing was to return the soul to the body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen thought about it for a while, then decided to ask the Great Sage just in case.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Great Sage, do you have anything that can return the soul to the body?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: Nope, but if you want something like that, you’ll have to find Old Lord Taishang. That old brat’s Nine Reincarnation Soul Pill is a pill to return the soul to the body. But that old Daoist might not give it to you.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Old Lord Taishang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sighed in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, he already thought about how Old Lord Taishang would have something to return the soul to the body, but he didn’t add Old Lord Taishang as a friend yet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had only added three people from the group: Yue Lao, Erlang Shen and the Monkey King.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, they had taken the initiative and added him, and their intimacy level were all above Friendly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he wanted the Nine Reincarnation Soul Pill, he had to take the initiative this time and add Old Lord Taishang as friend.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nobody knew what was their intimacy level…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen thought about it, then sent a message of thanks to the Monkey King. He immediately replied with a message that told him to hurry up and send the treasures over before the two stopped chatting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen opened the member list of the WeChat group and clicked on Old Lord Taishang’s icon.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>To add or not to add, that is the question.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen thought about his bet with Su Qihu and Elder Su, who was floating behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He made his decision.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Add.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I have accepted your friend request. Now let’s chat!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Accepted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately glanced at the intimacy level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>0.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang: ?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had never met any deities that would send just a symbol.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He gulped, then bravely sent a message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Old Lord Taishang, this little deity has a request to beg of you.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang: ?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It was another f*cking question mark.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It seems like this Old Lord Taishang was pretty cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, if Ye Zichen recalled at the intimacy level of cold, he could understand there wasn’t anything else the other person could reply him with.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Old Lord Taishang was any more intimate, the intimacy level wouldn’t be cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: I want to ask Old Lord Taishang for a celestial pill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang: What pill?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Nine Reincarnation Soul Pill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were no more replies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though Ye Zichen waited ten minutes, Old Lord Taishang did not send any reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It truly was as the Monkey King had said. This pill was definitely rather valuable, so Old Lord Taishang was reluctant to give it out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sent another message with the mindset of just giving it a shot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Old Lord, is that alright?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang: What is your celestial title? Why have I never heard of you?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s finally here.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s heart jumped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was exactly what he was worried about. Celestial title, how could he have any celestial title.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen let out a long sigh, then got ready to show off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: I am Erlang Shen’s brother and am good friends with Yue Lao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang: Oh? &lt;insert three shocked emojis&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your intimacy level with Old Lord Taishang increased by 20. Current intimacy level: Cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bringing people up truly was good.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed like the Heavenly Court was more or less the same with the mortal realm. As long as you would bring people up every now and then, everyone are good friends.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen beat the iron while it was hot after seeing a sliver of hope.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Old Lord, if you don’t believe it, then you can ask. As for my celestial title, this little deity would really find it inconvenient to say it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang: Oh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang did not even reply him after ten-odd minutes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Ye Zichen was getting impatient…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your intimacy level with Old Lord Taishang increased by 80. Current intimacy level: Friendly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nearly jumped up in excitement after seeing this message.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s Friendly now.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>According to his experience dealing with these deities. As long as the intimacy level was friendly, his false identity would definitely not be seen through.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most importantly, the chance has come!</span></p>
