 <p><span style>Chapter 531 – Art of Soul Guidance</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pill was completely green, while six spiral lines were laid out across its surface, as it glowed faintly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fragrance of the pill did not disperse, and one could tell that it was clearly not a normal pill just from looking at its surface.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is… a pill you just refined?” Old Lord Taishang was stunned. He carefully put the pill into his hands and sniffed it. “You refined it with the materials I gave you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you think? I don’t understand any of this at all. I just refined whatever you put inside,” Ye Zichen smiled while looking at Old Lord Taishang’s surprised demeanor. “How is it? My talent is pretty good, isn’t it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t believe it.” With that, Old Lord Taishang popped the pill into his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao and God of Fortune both set their gazes on Old Lord Taishang. After a while, the latter opened his eyes and grabbed Ye Zichen by his shoulders. “How did you do it? Soul guidance… You actually know how to use your soul to guide it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both God of Fortune and Yue Lao were rather surprised by Old Lord Taishang’s excitement. As one of the Three Pure Ones, and as the imperial pill refiner of the Heavenly Court, Old Lord Taishang hadn’t shown such a demeanor in a very long time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The previous time he had been that excited was right before the Immortality Peach Feast a thousand years ago when he refined a Level Nine Sky Grade Pill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I refined it just like that. How else could I have done it,” in that moment, Ye Zichen finally confirmed that his pill refinement was a success. Actually, the main reason he was able to refine it was because he was dead set on it, then all of a sudden, his soul randomly went into the pill furnace…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t have a clue about how it happened at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Soul guidance. You are actually capable of soul guidance…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang muttered excitedly to himself as he took a few steps back. Soul Guidance was a technique that any pill refiner would be desperate to learn, and Old Lord Taishang was naturally no exception to that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, only geniuses were able of figuring out how to do it. Even though he had refined pills for several hundred thousand years…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was still clueless about the technique.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can you teach me the method of Soul Guidance?” Old Lord Taishang requested like a disciple would.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both Yue Lao and God of Fortune were dumbfounded. They had never seen a situation like this occur with Old Lord Taishang ever since they came to know each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not so sure,” Ye Zichen scratched his head. He was speaking the truth. Back then, his soul had randomly entered. He didn’t even know what was going on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All he knew at the time was shape the pill, open the furnace and take the pill out. There was nothing else on his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Keeping secrets for yourself isn’t the act of a good daoist friend,” Old Lord Taishang raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I really don’t know,” Ye Zichen pleaded his innocence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk, never mind. Whatever, this old man doesn’t want to learn it anymore,” Old Lord Taishang replied in annoyance. “Isn’t it just Soul Guidance? Sooner or later, this old man will figure it out for himself!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen really didn’t know what to say. It was clear that Old Lord Taishang thought that he didn’t want to teach it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, in all honesty, he really doesn’t know how to teach it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, he ignored Old Lord’s sour words, then raised his eyebrows, “Don’t make me feel guilty. I meant it when I said that I don’t know. Also, that pill just now was my hard work, and was actually my first pill ever. You should compensate me since you just ate it, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kid, have some conscience. This old man introduced you to the art in good will, and this old man actually tried the pill for you personally, fearlessly. You’re actually telling me to compensate you?” Old Lord Taishang raised his eyebrows and put his hands on his hips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop bullshitting here, you’re useless if you don’t know the properties of the pills after refining pills for so long. As for what you said about introducing me, can you stop messing around? I didn’t even see you when I finished refining the pill. When I came out, I just saw you playing cards here. You didn’t even say anything from start to finish. Seriously, hurry up and compensate me!” Ye Zichen was completely speechless, so he chose not to argue with Old Lord Taishang, and promptly reached out his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then tell me what you want. Isn’t it just a crappy pill?” Old Lord Taishang answered with disdain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want your Pill Refining Manual. You said that you were going to check my talent before I could start. It is definitely clear that my talent is superb. You said that keeping secrets is not a good daoist friend, so don’t hide it!” Ye Zichen answered with a coy smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang’s expression immediately turned &nbsp;upon hearing that.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pill Refining Manual!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Seriously!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re way too daring! You’re actually asking for my Pill Refining Manual, that is seriously way too much. Do you even know what that represents!?” Old Lord Taishang rolled his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shrugged with a smile, “Then… give me my pill back. If you can’t do it, then refine one that’s exactly the same as mine was for me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh…” Old Lord Taishang suddenly laughed coldly. </span><i><span style>If I could refine one that’s exactly the same, I wouldn’t have a need to learn the method of Soul Guidance from him.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen glanced at Old Lord Taishang with innocent eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang immediately got annoyed when he saw the gaze, “Fine, I’ll give it to you, but don’t get so full of yourself. You can’t refine anything without fire.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn’t you say I can use Beast Fire?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows and smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang nodded, “Indeed, but do you think that’s easy to get? I can give you the manual, but contact me after getting Beast Fire. Otherwise, it’s pointless.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Old Lord Taishang raised his hand, and pushed God of Fortune, Yue Lao as well as Ye Zichen out of the manor with a snort, “Alright, stop bothering this old man. You guys are annoying!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After pushing the three out, Old Lord Taishang put his hands behind his back, then walked towards the pill refinement room with a loud shout, “All of you, come to the pill refinement room and refine pills!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Seriously, that old man…” Ye Zichen couldn’t help but shake his hand after leaving from Old Lord Taishang’s manor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Yue Lao had been his friend for many years, he naturally understood Old Lord Taishang’s personality, “He has an obsessive interest in pill refinement. It would’ve been fine if Sky Sovereign taught him directly!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But I really don’t know, Ye Zichen shrugged his shoulders helplessly. “If I actually knew, would I hide it from him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao and God of Fortune nodded. They understood very well that Ye Zichen wasn’t someone like that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh yeah, do you guys know where I can get Beast Fire?” Ye Zichen couldn’t help but ask. All he lacked to refine pills was fire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uhm… Beast Fire is rather hard to come by. I heard that only the Beast Fire is shed by ten-thousand years old spiritual beasts as they undergo a change, can be used by others. Old Zhao and I are not pill refiners, so we’ve never actually paid much attention to it,” Yue Lao said with a frown. “But if Sky Sovereign wants me to, then I will pay more attention to it from now on.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Same here,” God of Fortune agreed. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then thanks!” Ye Zichen nodded thankfully, then returned to the True Lord manor after bidding Yue Lao and God of Fortune farewell. It had already been several hours since he left the manor. </span><i><span style>It’s time for me to see how the fairies are doing!</span></i></p>
