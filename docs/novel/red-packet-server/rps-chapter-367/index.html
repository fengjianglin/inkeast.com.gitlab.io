 <p><span style>Chapter 367 – Su Yan’s Abnormality</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ye Zichen!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Yang Yushi spoke aloud his name, all the passengers within the cabin were shocked. Plenty of them had paid attention to the news about Maintaining Beauty Corporation, and even though the news report did not mention Ye Zichen’s name, someone did reveal after wards that the young man who uttered such brave words at Maintaining Beauty Corporation’s press conference was named Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No wonder I felt like that young man was a bit familiar,” the surrounding passengers couldn’t help but mutter, while the others also exclaimed in awe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Song An’s expression turned for the worse when he noticed the chatter of the surrounding passengers. However, nobody cared about how he felt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, Yang Yushi nodded towards Yang Zhen, “Yeah, it was Ye Zichen. You suddenly fainted earlier, then this self-proclaimed expert nearly caused you to pass on, it was Ye Zichen who saved you miraculously.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A hint of pride and excitement was evident on Yang Yushi’s face when she mentioned Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What a joke. Both him and I acted. How can you be sure that it was the brat who cured him?” Song An couldn’t help but snort.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the surrounding passengers revealed looks of disdain. None of them had known previously that this person actually had such bad character.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He actually still wants to steal the honor at a time like this. </span></i><span style>Some of the people who were subscribed to his Weibo all decided to unsubscribe after getting off the plane.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck, how can someone be this shameless?” a man amongst the passengers stood up and frowned. “Laozi doesn’t know you, Song An or whatever. This person was clearly cured by that little bro, and you actually still came over to take the honor. I seriously want to punch you. Hurry up and f*ck off… Laozi gets annoyed just from seeing you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm? Hehe? Trying ‘hehe’ing again!?” the man immediately rolled up his sleeves, while the surrounding passengers immediately held him back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Song An glanced at his physique and shrunk his neck, “I don’t want to speak to a brute like you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, he hurriedly left the cabin.</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>“Tsk, what the hell!” the man snorted at Song An’s fleeing back. Then he raised his eyebrows towards Yang Zhen. “Let me tell you, the only reason you managed to live is all thanks to that little bro’s medical skills. We passengers all witnessed that. As for Song An, it would be better if it was named Farewell<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>.”</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the surrounding passengers nodded in agreement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Yang Yushi also spoke up, “Dad, how about we go and thank him. No matter what…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ll talk about it later!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, even until they got off the plane, Yang Zhen still did not go and thank Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was something Ye Zichen had expected. He understood Yang Zhen’s personality way too well. Having Yang Zhen lower himself down to thank Ye Zichen was even harder than killing him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi!” Su Yiyun immediately walked over with a smile when Ye Zichen walked out of the airport, while giving him a bear hug. “The Dominating CEO finally came back from the capital. Zeze, a small target of a hundred million.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I just said it randomly. Is there a need of reacting so much?” Ye Zichen put on a helpless expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun immediately teased, “You just randomly said something that normal people and even some businessmen can’t even imagine in their entire lives. Did you know that you’ve even become an internet celebrity!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Internet celebrity!?” That was something Ye Zichen never expected. It was something that didn’t happen even when he sang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah… Dominating CEO, National Hubby, National Love Rival! Seriously, if you trust me and shout out that you’re Ye Zichen, a bunch of girls would immediately express their willingness to give themselves to you within three minutes!” Su Yiyun laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately frowned towards him and walked in front of Su Yan, “You came.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm,” Su Yan replied plainly, then smiled. “Congratulations, you've become successful.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she reached out her hand, the distant action caused Ye Zichen to frown. </span><i><span style>It shouldn’t be like this between us.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen thought that Su Yan was unhappy due to what Su Yiyun had said unfiltered, so he immediately wrapped Su Yan into his embrace with a small, “I’m still a worker in front of you no matter how successful I am! You are the proprietress!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm, that’s true,” Su Yan continued to reply plainly. Ye Zichen could see how forceful her smile was, and he noticed how stiff Su Yan’s body was when he pulled her into his arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As confusion rose in Ye Zichen’s heart, Su Yiyun raised his eyebrows on the side, “Hey, if you are just being lovey-dovey here, then that’s too outrageous!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You brat!” Ye Zichen held Su Yan’s head, then shook his head with a chuckle. “Didn’t you find your true love recently? Why don’t I see her with you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I came to welcome you back, so she…” the moment Su Yiyun replied, a faint giggle sounded out from afar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who said I didn’t come!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ E, why did you come? Didn’t you say that you have lessons?” a hint of shock alongside excitement appeared on Su Yiyun’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The girl instantly pouted with a snort, “I’m just seeing if you’re cheating on me. I’m just going on a daily patrol.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Ye Zichen glanced at the girl.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The girl was rather tall, and emitted the feeling of being the daughter of a small family. Ye Zichen blessed them true-heartedly in his heart when he saw how well she and Su Yiyun got along.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh my dear mistress, how would I dare with you here!” Su Yiyun’s face was covered with smiles. Then he introduced the girl to Ye Zichen. “Li Min’e, my girlfriend.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph!” Li Min’e smiled and wrinkled her nose. Then she pouted at Ye Zichen. “You’re Ye Zichen? There’s nothing special about you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but raised his eyebrows with a chuckle when he saw her cute expression, “What? Did I disappoint you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk, what does that have to do with me?” Li Min’e pouted with a snort. “Su Yiyun keeps on talking about you all the time, telling me just how amazing you are… if I didn’t know that Susu’s your girlfriend, I would suspect you two of… Ugh, that’s disgusting!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, she stuck out her tongue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, Ye Zichen couldn’t help but exclaim in his heart. </span><i><span style>So this girl is pretty playful. Her personality definitely gets along well with a playful person like Su Yiyun.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Damn girl, you actually thought that of me… It seems like I have to find a chance to eat you to make you know how amazing this lord is,” Su Yiyun chuckled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph! Keep dreaming!” Li Min’e pouted, before the two started to argue again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but smile as he looked at the scene with interest. He subconsciously look towards Su Yan, only to noticed that she looked as if she was lost, while she started straight in front of her with unmoving eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Su Yan?” Ye Zichen called her name out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only after a while did Su Yan return to her senses and smile brightly, “What happened? My older brother and older sister… They seriously just argue all the time!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that Ye Zichen did not reply, she raised her eyebrows with a smile once again, “Are you a bit tired? Do you need me to get my brother to send you back?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Su Yan!” Ye Zichen said slightly worriedly, then looked at her confused face. “Just what happened to you?”</span></p>
