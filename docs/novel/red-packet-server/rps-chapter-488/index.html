 <p><span style>Chapter 488 – Acquaintance</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was left all alone in the room after Zuo Mo left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He put his phone onto the table, then supported his head with his hands, “It’s all been dealt with.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment he said that, the phone on the table rang, and a system notification popped up on the screen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: That’s correct. You dealt with it very well. It seems like it won’t take long for the entire Eastern Continent to know of your existence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you sure that they will really come and find me after doing that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, Ye Zichen did have some selfish reasons for causing havoc at the Azure Sky Pavilion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had gotten separated from everyone else after ascending to the Immortal Region. Thus, if he wanted to find everyone else in that ocean of people, not only was it too inefficient, the chances of him even being able to do so were too low.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter what, the Azure Sky Pavilion was one of the peak powers, by causing havoc there…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The others should be able to hear about him, and come over!</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: At the very least, it’ll be a lot easier to find you compared to when you were completely nameless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s true,” Ye Zichen smiled. At the same time, the system also sent another notification.</span></p>
 <p><span style>System notification: No need to think about so much. Those allies who favor you will appear by your side in the end no matter what. However, your actions just now are going to cause trouble a bit of trouble for you. Pay attention to that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had already anticipated what the system just mentioned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, one wasn’t worried about more trouble when already surrounded trouble. He was trouble himself, and if he was afraid of people causing trouble for him, then Ye Zichen might as well just directly tell the system to kill him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, he merely returned his phone to his pocket, then left the restaurant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment he walked out of the restaurant entrance, a voluptuous woman wearing a white flowery dress walked up to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re looking for me?” Ye Zichen looked around, and noticed that there wasn’t anyone else around him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn’t you tell me to come and find you? Why are you so shocked? Do you think that laoniang could eat you?” the way the lady spoke was of a huge difference to how she appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stared at her in shock for a while…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stone Fairy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shhh,” the lady quickly covered his mouth. “What Stone Fairy, I’m called Blue Lotus Fairy now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So basically, she is Stone Fairy!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the two wandered on the streets, since Blue Lotus Fairy was a fairy of the Heavenly Court, when it coupled with her nice figure and looks, plenty of men turned their heads to look at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen, who was chatting with her did not think so much. </span><i><span style>Seriously… this fairy…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you say? You want laoniang to be the teacher for the makeup lesson for those fairies? Stop kidding me. How could I have time when I have dates all the time!” The moment she spoke, her rough personality was immediately revealed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but facepalm and sigh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, at that very moment, three or four lecherous looking men surrounded them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Beauty, interested in coming to play with us?” the man with huge eyebags asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was completely speechless.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Seriously, why are people like this everywhere. If this was in the Modern World, they would literally just be delinquents and rascals! </span></i><span style>However, Ye Zichen was not going to make a move. Blue Lotus Fairy was of the Sky Immortal level herself, and the men only barely reached the Spiritual Body level…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>They’re going to get beaten up so quick!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, Blue Lotus Fairy did not actually make a move immediately. She quickly put on the appearance of a frightened girl and looked around in a way that sought help.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can anyone help? There are bad people here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The surrounding people did want to help, but they all trembled and stopped in their tracks when they saw the four people. Those four people were famous bad people in the city, and were named the “Four Evil Men.”.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The four of then didn’t have great power, but they did have people backing them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their big boss was the greatest bandit leader just outside the city, and his people would do all sorts of atrocious acts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, beauty, don’t be scared. We aren’t bad people,” the rascals all thought that Blue Lotus Fairy was scared, so they immediately smiled and walked closer while displaying their yellowed teeth. At the same time, they also snorted towards Ye Zichen with frowns. “Grandson, don’t interrupt this lord’s business. F*ck off.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck, is laoniang not charming enough? Why is not one coming to help even after shouting for so long? The Immortal Region is really no good, why are there just a bunch of pussies here,” Blue Lotus fairy cursed. She raised her hand and ripped the sides of the bottom of her skirt, then kicked the four bad people with her white legs. “If you want to pick laoniang up, then at least brush your teeth, ya’ know?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sudden change in attitude turned everyone speechless. Ye Zichen also gulped silently. </span><i><span style>No wonder this woman could arm wrestle Yang Jian, she’s definitely a female tyrannosaur!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You youngsters actually aren’t doing good, and want to take advantage of good peasant women on the streets… You guys are definitely unlucky since you met laoniang. This time, treat it as laoniang eradicating evil!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She easily broke then men’s legs, then grabbed the collar of one of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After throwing him out by ten-odd meters with a shoulder throw, she did the same to all of the others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You actually dared to bully the subordinates of I, Yellow Hair Bro. Speak up your name, who are you!” an angry shout sounded out behind them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blue Lotus Fairy rubbed her nose, then tilted her head, “Laoniang did it. Skinny, what do you want to do!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the young man immediately smiled in excitement, and ran over when he saw the Blue Lotus Fairy and Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, Blue Lotus Fairy immediately thought that he was attacking her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She easily dislocated the Yellow Hair’s arm, then kicked him down so that he kneeled on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You want to attack laoniang? Heh…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ouchie ouchie, it hurts!” Yellow Hair bared his teeth and shouted. “We’re on the same side. Sis, don’t attack me, we’re on the same side!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who’s on the same side as you!? Laoniang has never seen you before,” Blue Lotus Fairy frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yellow Hair immediately tuned towards Ye Zichen, “Boss!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That completely shocked Blue Lotus Fairy. She quickly glanced towards Ye Zichen with raised eyebrows. “You know him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t think so?” Ye Zichen replied in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Yellow Hair immediately shouted out, “Boss, it’s me! Super Saiyan, transform!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That instantly caused Ye Zichen to recall who he was.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>How did this kid get over here? And he actually has the strength of a False Earth Immortal.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Release him, I do know this brat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blue Fairy immediately re-attached the kid’s arm. Then, Yellow Hair scrambled up, then ran into Ye Zichen’s arms and sobbed, “Boss, I finally found family!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can cry, but don’t rub all your snot on laozi,” Ye Zichen tried to push him away, but he still did as he pleased.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, you aren’t listening, right? Blue Lotus… Teach him another lesson!”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Original Chapter Teaser:</strong>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Man, everything went... So much simpler than I imagined it would have gone. Heck, I felt like it was almost too easy. I literally went over, kicked down a few doors, beat a few people up, and now the Pavilion Head just agreed to my terms? Like... What?</p>
 <p>Or was it because of Zuo Mo and the Treasure Tower? I do think that bringing them along was a superb decision. It was a bit expensive, but it was definitely worth it. Without them, we probably wouldn't have settled things so quickly...</p>
 <p>Now that I've dealt with that, I suppose it's time for me to go and see what I can do about the stuff in the Heavenly Court. I did ask Stone Fairy to come down to see me. I wonder if she'll be arriving any time soon?</p>
 <p>Also, demons... I need more information about them, and how to deal with them.</p>
