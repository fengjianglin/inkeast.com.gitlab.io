 <p><span style>Chapter 595 – Poisoned Old Li</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang was truly annoyed in the recent times. </span><i><span style>There’s actually someone even more talented than me at pill refinement in this world! He’s managed to learn the art of spiritual guidance right after coming into contact with pill refinement, and even managed to get a Beast Fire.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just look at these apprentices I took in…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Exploding furnaces!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Exploding furnaces everywhere!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>All they do is waste my materials. </span></i><span style>Even though the materials were only of the lowest grade, he was still beyond annoyed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Look at you guys! You’ve learned pill refinement from me for around half a year haven’t you? Yet, you only have a thirty percent success rate for the most basic of pills. Don’t you dare say that you’re my disciples. I’m way too ashamed for that!” Old Lord Taishang scolded them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The surrounding disciples all lowered their heads, and did not dare to retort.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master, stop getting angry at these junior brothers,” Old Lord Taishang’s chief disciple walked over with his phone. He smiled towards his junior brothers, then handed Old Lord Taishang’s phone over. “Someone is looking for you. Take a look, please allow me to watch over these junior brothers for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm,” Old Lord Taishang nodded.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>If I continue to stay here, I might really beat them to death due to my anger…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, he took his phone, and went to sit down on a vine chair. He thought that it was only Yue Lao telling him to play cards with them, but…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why is it him again!?” Old Lord Taishang threw his phone to the side in his anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment, the phone rang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang picked his phone back up and was rather annoyed by the new message notifications.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just what do you want!? I’m not in a good mood, so don’t annoy me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Back in the Demon Realm…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sat on top of the pile of straw in the prison cell. Since Lu Lu was around, the prison guards did not dare to get near them at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How is it?” Lu Lu asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Doesn’t seem too good,” Ye Zichen replied, and rolled his eyes at Old Lord Taishang’s response.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is he having his menopause? God, it’s so hard to understand what makes him angry and what doesn’t!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t want anything. You should have some sort of poison curing pill right? Give me one.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you think I’m your pharmacy? Do I have to give you a pill just because you want one?” Old Lord Taishang replied in anger. “I don’t have any. Go and look somewhere else, stop pissing me off.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Lord, look at what you’re saying…” Ye Zichen smiled. “No matter what, you’re one of the Three Pure Ones, you have to be more magnanimous. What’s more, doesn’t our revolutionary friendship run deep? Did you forget how I gave you better cigarettes when you were competing with Yue Lao?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This old man bought it from you,” Old Lord Taishang snorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, alright, stop throwing a tantrum. I’m really desperate here, so be more forgiving and send me one,” Ye Zichen replied with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What poison is it?” Old Lord Taishang didn’t want to waste his breath. </span><i><span style>I’ll just give him the pill, so he’ll stop annoying me.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What sort of poison is it?” Ye Zichen asked Lu Lu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Lu blinked, “How would I know?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at Lu Lu speechlessly, then typed out a reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know what poison it is.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Send me a blood sample.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang was already speechless. Instead of retorting, he directly sent a red packet over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received Old Lord Taishang’s red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Clay vial x1.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Put the blood sample inside and send it back over. I’ll examine it, then give you the cure.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen withdrew the vial, and crooked his finger towards Lu Lu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?” Lu Lu walked over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I need some of your blood.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Ye Zichen used a blade formed from spiritual energy to make a small cut on Lu Lu’s arm before she could react, then moved the vial so that blood dripped into it…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her blood was a purple shade that had a hints of black smoke coming out of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ouch!” Lu Lu yelped softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen used spiritual energy to seal her wound, then stared at the vial.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Scan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Send.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang received your red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style> “This is the blood sample of the person you said was poisoned?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang’s eyes twitched. Purple blood with black vapor… </span><i><span style>I literally just cured someone of that poison.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes,” Ye Zichen nodded. “How long would it take for you to prepare the cure?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment he sent the message, he noticed that Old Lord Taishang had already sent him a red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received Old Lord Taishang’s red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blood Exorcism Pill x1.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Here’s the cure, give it to him,” Old Lord Taishang replied. Then sent a follow up message. “Where did your friend get poisoned?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How did you know that it’s a friend and not me?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“After getting poisoned, the victim will suffer a shock. When they awaken, they will feel powerless in their limbs. You’ll be very lucky if you manage to actually survive this poison with your pitiful cultivation level,” Old Lord Taishang snorted. “Even Old Li couldn’t get up for half a month after getting poisoned.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Old Li!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King Li!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was stunned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You said Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King Li fell victim to this poison as well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm, don’t you remember him investigating the situation after the Seven Fairies’ concert?” Old Lord Taishang confirmed. “Oh yeah, where did your friend get poisoned? Tell me, I might be able to find out more.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The demon realm!” Ye Zichen squinted his reply and typed out his reply. If Old Lord Taishang was in the same room as him, he would be able to see just how unmistakably dark Ye Zichen’s expression had turned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There!? Doesn’t that mean you are currently…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, I’m in the Demon Realm,” Ye Zichen confirmed. “It seems like demons have already infiltrated into the Heavenly Court. This isn’t the time to speak. I’ll come to the Heavenly Court after getting out of here. Let’s chat in detail then!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay. Do you need me to get God of Thunder and co. to back you up?” Old Lord Taishang replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Probably not, the demons haven’t noticed me yet,” With that, Ye Zichen told Old Lord Taishang that he’ll talk to him later before putting his phone again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, he was unable to calm down…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Heavenly Court… underworld…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>The demons have their claws on these two realms already, and there was the elder from the Treasure Tower as well…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just what exactly is the demons doing!?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Are they trying to take over the Three Realms at once!?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>No matter what, I can’t let them get what they wish for. But more importantly right now, I have to break Lu Lu and Su Yan out.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“How’re you doing? Have you recovered?” Ye Zichen turned around and raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Lu, who was sitting cross-legged, opened her eyes. Her sharp gaze seemed to pierce through everything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She stood up from the straw pile and stretched lazily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Lord Taishang is truly the top pill refiner in the Three Realms. Kid, come with me, it’s time for the slaughter!”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Original Chapter Teaser:</strong>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Old Lord Taishang... Would he really help? That geezer might think that I'm asking him for the secret manul of pill refinement again....</p>
 <p>Ahh, whatever. I have no other choice. Let's just hope he doesn't ignore my messages...</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Now, c'mon old man. C'mon. Please answer. Please...</p>
 <p>Hmm now... Would Lu Lu be strong enough to get us out of here when she recovers? Probably, but I still need to find Su Yan.</p>
 <p>And what if Gu Li poisoned her too?</p>
 <p>What if it's something that Old Lord Taishang can't cure?</p>
 <p>What if...</p>
 <p>Ugh.</p>
 <p>And worst of all, Yumei's somewhere here as well. I should take this chance to get her out too, but how... This place seems to be Gu Li's territory... I don't think Yumei's going to be here, and I have no idea where Su Yiyun's territory is...</p>
