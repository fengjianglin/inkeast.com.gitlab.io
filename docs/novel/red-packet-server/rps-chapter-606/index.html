 <p><span style>Chapter 606 – A Love-Hate Relationship</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Report to the Heavenly Court?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Since the Great Sage is the Victorious Fighting Buddha of the Heavenly Court, then it’s natural for me to find them, but I don’t seem to recall his little brother Yuan Hong being related to the Heavenly Court?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s more, this is the land of the fox yaos in the Endless Beast Region. The Heavenly Court and the Beast Region…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>They don’t even speak.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>They fight!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Am I really going to report this to the Heavenly Court?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen felt a bit hesitant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The white-shirted man immediately said to him once again, “Get Old Lord Taishang in the Heavenly Court, and Hua Tuo in the Underworld!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, the white-shirted man walked beside Su Liu’er and glanced at her, before grabbing Yuan Hong from her arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you doing!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Saving him,” the white-shirted man replied plainly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Liu’er immediately handed Yuan Hong over and pleaded, “I beg you, please save him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm,” a faint golden light enveloped the white-shirted man and the two injured people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Ye Zichen got into contact with Old Lord Taishang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Lord!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In order for Old Lord Taishang to get the message right away, Ye Zichen spammed him with several tens of messages, then directly sent a video chat request.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m really busy right now. If it’s nothing special, then wait till I’m free.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Old Lord Taishang moved his hand over to turn off the chat. He still thought that Ye Zichen wanted the pill refinement secret manual for him. That was the most important thing to him, so he didn’t want to hand it over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen naturally understood what Old Lord Taishang was thinking. “I don’t want the secret manual, I want to ask you to save someone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Save someone? If it’s a normal mortal, then you’re enough. Why do you need me?” Old Lord Taishang raised his eyebrows. “What’s more, I specialize in pill refinement. The pills I refined aren’t suitable for mortals.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s to save the Great Sage.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The monkey?” Old Lord Taishang. “What happened to him? Is he dying? That’s great news. I never liked him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, then keep gloating. There’s no need for you then.” Ye Zichen turned off the video chat coldly, then sought out Hua Tuo of the underworld.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In terms of medical ethics, Hua Tuo was definitely one of the best people. Ye Zichen merely spoke about the situation briefly before Hua Tuo agreeing to hurry over as fast as possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After chatting with Hua Tuo, Ye Zichen noticed that Old Lord Taishang had sent him a bunch of messages.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The monkey’s seriously going to die?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s impossible. He’s the monkey with the Fiery Eyes of Truth, he’s damn sturdy. How could he die?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, is he seriously in trouble?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry up and tell me your location. I’ll come over there immediately.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason Old Lord Taishang had spoke like that during the video chat was mainly because he didn’t really believe what Ye Zichen said. He knew very well just how strong the Great Sage was. The Great Sage was completely fine even in Old Lord Taishang’s pill furnace, and even managed to get a pair of Fiery Eyes of Truth out of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He really didn’t believe that the Great Sage could come into such danger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, when he saw how cold Ye Zichen was when he turned off the video chat, he felt something amiss…</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s why he sent so many messages to Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The back mountains in the land of the Endless Beast Region’s fox yaos, on the Central Continent outside the Immortal Region.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen left the chat after sending the message, and instead sat on the ground to stare closely at the white-shirted man who was keeping the Great Sage and Yuan Hong alive.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He… should be the system, right?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen muttered silently. Yet, a lot of his actions confused Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He calls Su Liu’er Liu’er-jie.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>He seems to know everything about what I will experience in the future, as if he has been through all that.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I’ve never been able to see his face, since it seemed to be hidden and censored.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just who is he!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen muttered to himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment, a spiritual fluctuation occurred at the portal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone in the back mountains immediately looked towards the portal vigilantly. </span><i><span style>Since we were causing trouble in the Demon Realm earlier, are they attacking now that some of us are injured?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“We meet again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The people who walked out of the portal were Gu Li and Su Yiyun, while Su Yan and Lu Lu stood beside them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ sis,” a hint of light returned to Su Liu’er’s dimmed eyes. Yet, she couldn’t help but yell coldly when she turned towards Gu Li. “What do you want!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she spoke, she also subconsciously protected the white-shirted man, Yuan Hong and Sun Wukong with her spiritual energy. She understood very well that they could not afford to get harassed under these circumstances.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master of the Fox Yaos, you are truly amazing. But don’t fight with me, I didn’t come here for that,” with that, Gu Li shoved Su Yan and Lu Lu forward. “That senior asked us to bring them over, but don’t overthink things. We didn’t come to ask for peace.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen,” Su Yan and Lu Lu ran towards Ye Zichen together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was momentarily surprised, before he pushed them behind his back, and squinted his eyes coldly, “It’s impossible even if you do want peace.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha…” Gu Li snorted. “No matter what you say, I’ve already brought them over. That’s that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why didn’t you bring Xiao Yumei back!?” Ye Zichen interrogated Gu Li.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have to ask your good bro about that,” Gu Li indicated towards Su Yiyun. “Who knows what sort of secret technique he used to actually evade that senior’s detection. But then again, Xiao Yumei is his new pet, so it makes sense for him to be reluctant to part from her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Su Yiyun!” Ye Zichen looked towards Su Yiyun darkly. He could still remember every single one of the stabs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go back,” Su Yiyun turned towards the portal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clenched his fist and cursed, “If you dare to touch even a single strand of hair on Xiao Yumei, I’ll never be done with you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm,” Su Yiyun continued to answer indifferently before entering the portal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Li looked meaningfully towards Su YIyun, then back onto Ye Zichen, before he shook his head with a chuckle, “Bye bye.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he stepped into the portal, the portal disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>What they didn’t know was that…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you want to die!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Gu Li entered the portal, Su Yiyun suddenly turned around and grabbed him by the neck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t try and challenge my bottom line again. Gu Li, it’s extremely simple for me to kill you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kill me? Don’t kid yourself. Do you want to ruin this huge plan of yours by killing me?” Gu Li pushed his hand away with a smile. “You managed to stay undercover for so long for some shocking ploy, right? But that senior isn’t Black Dragon, do you think you can continue on with it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, just think about yourself first,” Su Yiyun looked at him sullenly. “Don’t think that I don’t know what you’ve been doing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, yeah. But, thinking about it, it really is interesting. One doesn’t know what’s going on, and the other is hiding everything. If this was a tv show, then it would definitely top the charts! What a love-hate relationship. Hahaha…” Gu Li chuckled, then twitched his mouth. “Hey, can you give me a hint of what you’re planning? Let’s be honest, neither of us are actually devoted to the Demon Realm, so it’s fine if you tell me, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You want to know?” Su Yiyun chuckled. “I’ll tell you right before you die!”</span></p>
