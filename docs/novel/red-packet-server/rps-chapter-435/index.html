 <p><span style>Chapter 435 – Gu Li Appears</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Rebel!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>This was a thought that the abyssals did not even dare to harbor. The moment the abyssals were born, their minds would be scorched with an imprint that prevented them from rebelling. It could be said that they are the utmost loyal ones within the entire demon race.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Highness, we have no intention of rebelling!” the gigantic abyssal leader looked up with bloodshot eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen merely snorted faintly in response, “You’re still saying that you don’t want to rebel? I saw a murderous gaze just now, you wanted to attack me, right? Are you trying to kill your master to take his place?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Highness!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop calling me that. I think that you do want to rebel. Kill me now if you can. Otherwise, I’ll immediately return to the demon race and tell them that you abyssals want to rebel, so we’ll slaughter every last one of you!” Ye Zichen said in an extremely oppressing manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The abyssals kneeling on the ground all lowered their heads timidly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, the leader looked up and clenched his teeth, “Your Highness, how can I make you believe that we have no intention of rebelling?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you even need to ask?” Ye Zichen smiled. “Only the dead is trustworthy. If you are truly loyal towards the demon race, then… You know what you should do!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>According to what Taibai Jinxing said, the leading abyssal was the strongest amongst them, and would cause us the most threat.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>As long as I deal with it, then we’ll be under a lot less pressure later.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The abyssal clenched his teeth and kneeled onto the ground. Since he has already reached the level of a high leveled abyssal, he possessed the ability to think. He understood very well that if he died, then all his hard work would have been for nothing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, since His Highness wants him dead, how would he dare to stay alive!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fine! Since Your Highness wants me dead, then I’ll die!” the abyssal raised the bone club in his right hand, while it shimmered with a purple light, and smashed it down towards his own head…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Did I succeed?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stared at the huge abyssal below him, only to find the abyssal still kneeling on the floor. However, there was a young man beside him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, your actions are truly despicable!” the young man laughed playfully, then snatched the abyssal’s bone club and threw it to the side. He looked up towards Ye Zichen, who was in the sky. “You actually want to kill them using this method. Ye Zichen, I didn’t think that you actually learnt to use such petty tricks within a few days!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lord Gu!” the abyssal who swore death to prove his loyalty looked up in shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Gu Li also smile, “Qiu YI, don’t think that everyone with wings are the lords. He… is the demon race’s traitor at best!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Traitor?” the huge abyssal looked up him in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Li nodded, “You won’t understand it even if I tell you in detail. I’ll just tell you this, he is the enemy of the demon race!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gu Li, and trying to use them to kill me is not despicable?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was clear that the abyssal did not quite understand what was going on, so Ye Zichen merely spoke like that to confuse it even more, and cause it to be unsure of who to obey.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zeze, I didn’t think that you’d actually improve!” Gu Li snickered with a shake of his head, then smiled towards the abyssal. “Alright, there’s no need for you to deal with that traitor, but you should be able to tell that the person beside him is not of the demon race, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!” the huge abyssal nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Very good, then go and kill him. I have some things I want to chat with this Lord Fallen,” Gu Li laughed sinisterly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a brief consideration, the huge abyssal stood up from the ground and screeched, causing the other abyssals to all screech as well. The slimy monsters on the group also grew out pairs of invisible wings on their backs and flew towards Taibai Jinxing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need to mind this old man. Kill that Fallen!” Taibai Jinxing clenched his teeth, and switched his spiritual formation to the wind state, then quickly moved away, while the huge abyssals and low level abyssals to chase after him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come down and have a chat?” Gu Li squinted his eyes. His appearance had already changed a lot from their previous encounter. His hair was already turning a purplish red while his skin color had begun to turn bronze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a hint of red light in his eyes, while dense demonic energy surrounded his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, what did not change was his soft and dark smile, that made people want to punch his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m so sorry. I… don’t have much to say to you!” With that, the mirage of a huge dragon appeared behind Ye Zichen and roared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So annoying!” Xuan-Yuan Xiang gripped Xuan-Yuan Sword in her hands and continuously killed the abyssals crawling out of the shattered space.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the abyssals were weak, they were extremely numerous. What’s more, as the fractures between the Otherworld and Modern Realm increased, Xuan-Yuan Xiang felt like she was getting tired out. What’s more, she was also very worried about Ye Zichen’s situation within the Otherworld.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Screech…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Several tens of black MPVs stopped. Wei Chen jumped out of the car in a silver robe and ran in front of Xuan-Yuan Xiang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiang-jie, why are you here!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You guys finally came. Ye Zichen has already entered the Otherworld. He told me to guard this place! Since you guys have arrived, then I’ll leave this place to you. I have to return to his side,” Xuan-Yuan Xiang said anxiously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wei Chen nodded, “Then hurry. I have already contacted the local authorities. They will evacuate the civilians here very soon. When that happens, you do not need to suppress your own powers anymore!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brat, not bad,” Xuan-Yuan Xiang patted Wei Chen’s shoulder. “Then I’ll be off.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xuan-Yuan Xiang immediately disappeared from the Modern World.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Wei Chen also shouted towards the surrounding members, “Execute the mission according to our plan!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a brief exchange of blows, both sides backed off to a safe location and looked vigilantly at each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the recent period of time, Ye Zichen’s strength had already rose to a shocking height, and even the Dragon God had repeatedly called him a monster…</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he did not expect Gu Li to actually be no weaker than him, and even seemed slightly stronger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, not bad!” Gu Li smiled sinisterly, while getting very shocked… For he had actually paid a huge price to gain such strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He squinted his eyes, then proactively attacked without waiting for Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck off!” a shout sounded out. Not long later, Xuan-Yuan Sword, which was shimmering with golden light stabbed in the space between Ye Zichen and Gu Li.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xuan-Yuan Xiang, why did you come… The outside!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wei Chen and the rest of them have already arrived. I was worried that you would be in danger!” Xuan-Yuan Sword’s hands shook.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Gu Li suddenly smiled sinisterly, “Divine artifact? Hehe… Serious…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, a dense mist appeared beside him. At that moment, a chuckle also sounded out from the mist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xuan-Yuan Xiang, we haven’t met for so long. You’re still so alluring!”</span></p>
