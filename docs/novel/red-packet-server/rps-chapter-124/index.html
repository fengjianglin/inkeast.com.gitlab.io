 <p><span style>Chapter 124 – Deal</span></p>
 <p><span style>One of the Ten Yama Kings actually sent him a friend request.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, Ye Zichen had wanted to use this chance to get into the Underworld group, and save King Qinguang, in order to gain some fame in the Underworld.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But that’s great, King Chujiang added him almost instantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He heard that King Chujiang controlled the second hell in Hell, and he was an existence just behind King Qinguang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Accept.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately looked at the intimacy level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>100.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen instantly stopped worrying after seeing this number. At least it wasn’t Cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen thought that King Qinguang would sent a message to him, but he didn’t think that King Chujiang would directly make a group and add White Impermanence in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang: White Impermanence, the person that you said can save King Qinguang is him? @Only Idealism.</span></p>
 <p><span style>White Impermanence: Yes, that’s him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang: @Only Idealism! You are not someone of the Underworld. Just now, this king has checked through the list of all the ghost servants and ghost messengers of the ten halls, you are not on it! Who are you, you actually dared to say that you can help King Qinguang out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed like King Chujiang was a very vigilant person. The first thing he did was investigate Ye Zichen’s identity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed like he couldn’t pretend to be someone from the Underworld. However, if he said that he was someone from the Heavenly Court, then he might be beaten to death by King Chujiang, and it would affect White Impermanence as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen thought about it for a while, then answered honestly, “This little one is a mere mortal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mortal? How can a mortal know people of our Underworld!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s none of your business.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes at the screen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That Yama King was so cocky, asking so many questions, he wasn’t even that pressured when he chatted with the Great Sage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You dare to speak to this king like that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So what?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen replied with complete annoyance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang was the one asking him to do stuff, yet King Chujiang acted like he owed him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m telling you, King Chujiang, don’t use your underworld stuff with me. It’s no good, okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, a mere mortal actually dared to be so cocky, are you not afraid of me adding something onto your section on the Book of Life and Death, causing you to die earlier?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang sent him a question mark.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen squinted his eyes and replied the message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t try to scare me here, I’ll tell you clearly right now. I can help King Qinguang get out of trouble! Do you need me to help!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why should I believe you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t care if you do or not!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Oh wow, Ye Zichen offered to save King Qinguang, but actually needed to gain King Chujiang’s trust!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the chat group fell into silence, White Impermanence suddenly sent him a private message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“King Chujiang has the worst temper out of the Ten Yama Kings, he is also the most suspicious of people. He will be unhappy if you speak to him like this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“These sorts of people just got spoiled. He was a big boss for so long, he really thought that no one could deal with him. Don’t worry, he definitely wouldn’t dare to do anything to me, and would have to beg for my help.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Ye Zichen sent the news, King Chujiang spoke up in the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How are you going to help King Qinguang!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“None of your business either.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen mercilessly sent the message over, then immediately added something else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll save King Qinguang. As for you… We have to talk about the conditions.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t be unwilling, if the Heavenly Court really locked King Qinguang up, you guys will definitely revolt, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brat, don’t just say things, us, the people of the Underworld have always accepted the Heavenly Court as our leader.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was clear that they couldn’t just say things like revolting. Especially since King Chujiang was still suspecting Ye Zichen of being someone from the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since King Qinguang was taken away by the people from the Heavenly Court, the Underworld was in a mess.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was possible that Ye Zichen was the spy sent by the Heavenly Court in order to get evidence from them, the Ten Yama Kings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If they got evidence, then they could promptly lock all of them up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, I don’t care who you people from the Underworld look to as your leader! I’m just saying that you guys will definitely pay a heavy price in order to save King Qinguang, but if I do it, then your price will be much smaller.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Say it, just what do you need?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to know how to revive a ghost that died before their time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang replied without thinking. There was pretty much no loss for the Underworld by revealing this information.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, even if Ye Zichen was someone from the Heavenly Court, it was useless for him to know.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone in the Heavenly Court were deities, so they didn’t need to use this information.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If this brat was really a mortal as he said, then knowing this information was useless, since he wouldn’t be able to gather the materials for the revival.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You agreed so quickly?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen didn’t think that King Chujiang would agree so straightforwardly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Agreeing is no problem, but I can only tell you after seeing King Qinguang safely return to the Underworld.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem, but a verbal promise is no use. I need a written proof.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received King Chujiang’s oath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This King promises to tell you the method of revival as well as ten thousand Heaven and Earth merits as the reward after you save King Qinguang.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, just wait for my news.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>White Impermanence sent Ye Zichen another message after he left the chat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can you really save King Qinguang?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t trust me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course I trust you, I’m just a bit worried…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry, it’ll definitely be alright.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If the Heavenly Court really wants to do something to the Underworld, then they definitely wouldn’t let King Qinguang go back. They might very possibly lock him up in a secret dungeon in the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But what did Erlang Shen do?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was the head of security in the Heavenly Court. He definitely had the right to know after such a huge thing happened.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What was his relationship with Erlang Shen!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Sworn brothers.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Isn’t saving King Qinguang super simple?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sent Erlang Shen a message without thinking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, you busy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah!” Erlang Shen instantly replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you busying yourself with King Qinguang’s matters?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“King Qinguang?” Erlang Shen was clearly shocked. “Isn’t King Qinguang somebody of the Underworld? I’m advertising your products!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen slapped his thigh. He was in too much of a hurry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing had just taken King Qinguang away, how could they reach the Heavenly Court so quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I’ll leak a news to you first. King Qinguang should be brought to the Heavenly Court by Taibai Jinxing later. It seems like he caused some trouble, but that brat helped me out before, so I hope you can help me out a bit and directly tell me any news.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, why do you still have contact with people from the Underworld? The relationship between the Heavenly Court and the Underworld is really tense, if someone will ill intentions find out, then you’ll be in huge trouble.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen felt a lot of care from Erlang Shen’s message, causing his heart to warm up. Although Erlang Shen and him had never met, their bond was very strong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No worries, my identity is rather special. No matter what, King Qinguang is very important to me. So, bro, it’s on you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen definitely would do anything for his bro without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Ye Zichen quit WeChat after a simple thanks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He touched the Dragon Eye in his pocket.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>You’ll be able to be revived very soon.</span></i></p>
