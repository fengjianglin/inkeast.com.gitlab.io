 <p><span style>Chapter 584 – Wait there for me</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Someone is destroying Mount Supreme’s seals.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>This piece of news was like a bomb for everyone. However, plenty of people were actually excited about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Including… Qiu Yuan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was forcefully brought over by Ma Teng. All he wanted was…</span></p>
 <p><span style>To not be forced to cultivate!</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was also Mu Chengtian…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t even know how he managed to get out of the Hell Trials. He was sick of the rules of the game. He didn’t want to stay in a place where people were just going to die randomly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was the junior family head of a top family of the area outside of the Immortal Region, it was much better for him to just go back to inherit the family head position, then go out and play with girls.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, they were not the only ones. Ye Zichen’s entire gang seemed to want to leave as well. Of course, there were people who didn’t. These people still wanted to risk it and see if they could manage to get a divine artifact, since if they did manage it, then their time will finally have come.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t care what you all think, but the game must continue!” Duan Hai said firmly, and looked towards Ye Zichen meaningfully. “Of course, if anyone is dissatisfied with me, then you can fight me here and now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone else looked towards Ye Zichen’s group. They knew that the gang had some kind of conflict with Duan Hai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even the new black-robed people looked over, and one of them had even fixed his gaze on Ye Zichen for quite a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We don’t have any issues with you. Let’s begin!” Ye Zichen smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ruan Qingtian and Bai Hai had suggested that Duan Hai might be limited by the gaming rules.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Since that’s the case, I have no need to clash with him. All I have to do was wait for my chance.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha, since that’s the case, then before the game starts, let’s form the teams once more!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, a table with a box on top of it appeared in front of everyone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are twenty-six balls inside. The ones who gets 1 to 3 will form a team, 4 to 6 will form another, and so on. As for the people who received 25 and 26. Sorry, but you were unlucky, so you’ll be eliminated. Now… Let’s begin!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone immediately went up to the table one by one. However, they what they cared about when they picked up the balls were not who they were teamed up with. Rather, it was whether they would be able to form a team in the first place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“6!” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows when he got his. He had thought that Duan Hai would give him a 25 or 26.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Impossible, I can’t possibly be 25…” Suddenly, a person shouted maniacally. Then, after him, another person also revealed a dead expression, and the number on the ball in his hand was… 26!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm, sorry. You’ve been eliminated!” Duan Hai, who sat on the throne, smiled. The two people who got the balls of death immediately ran towards the exit of the hall as fast as they could.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Be eliminated!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two players fell limply onto the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone else in the room revealed looks of shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although elimination meant death, it was the first time it had actually happened in front of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The way this game works is simple. I’ll send you all to a secret location later. There are treasures, opportunities and danger everywhere in the secret location. If more than one of you want to get a treasure, then it is very simple, grab their jade pendant and crush it. That’s will be the end of his journey. However, if you find grabbing the jade pendant too troublesome, and just want to kill the other person, then I’m sorry. You will die after you killed him as well! Alright, I’ll give you half an hour to find your teammates. Let’s begin!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Duan Hai disappeared once again, while the people in the hall begun to shout…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m Number 17!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m Number 21!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m Number 14!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s group also got together and looked at each other’s numbers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems like I’m going to have to team up with outsiders,” Ye Zichen scratched his head with a wry smile. None of the group had a number that grouped up with his.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Approximately several minutes later, everyone in the hall stood together in threes. Only Ye Zichen and two people in long black robes didn’t.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You guys are in the group for 4 to 6, right? I’m Number 6!” Ye Zichen walked in front one of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That person nodded, then showed Ye Zichen his ball.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Number 5.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The remaining person also walked over and held up the Number 4 ball.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then please take care of me during the mission,” Ye Zichen smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two people nodded, but neither of them spoke.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Two strange people.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>And they don’t seem like they know each other.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As time ticked away, all of the other groups were in intense discussion as they got to know each other better. Yet, Ye Zichen’s team was...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Times up! Mission start!” Duan Hai suddenly appeared in the room, and clapped lightly. Everyone in the room disappeared in their groups.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When all of the players left, he squinted his eyes and snorted, “You want to ruin my plans? You’re just seeking death!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uhm… What should I call the two of you?” After teleporting to the secret location, Ye Zichen scratched his head, and glanced at the two black robed people beside him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“One!” The slightly smaller person replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then call me Two,” said the other one.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>These two are so weird.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but retort silently. </span><i><span style>But who cares about their real names. At least it is easier to have a conversation now that we have a way of addressing each other.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“One, Two, where should we go?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You choose.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, the two black-robed people spoke up together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rubbed his forehead…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It really is tiring to team up with people like this.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Since it was a secret location, it was not marked on the map, so Ye Zichen could only let out a soft sigh, then signal the two to wait a moment before walking over to the side to take out his phone and call the system.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, I’m at the third stage now. Where should I go?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, outside Mount Supreme.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man who had appeared to break the formation stood outside the mountain with a solemn frown. </span><i><span style>As expected of something left behind by a Sky Sovereign, it really is hard to break through it using only the formation skills of these realms.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, he paused for a moment, then walked to the side with a shake of his head, and took out his phone to type out a reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait at the teleportation point.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: Wait at the teleportation point.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What does the system want? Does he want me to give up on the treasure hunt? I don’t really care, since I’ve gotten enough from this place, but my teammates might not agree.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m in a team!” Ye Zichen frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later…</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: There are no treasures in the secret location. On the other hand, it’s actually filled with traps. Your luck isn’t that great, so you’ll end up triggering a lot of traps if you move around. The location of the teleportation point is a safe zone. Staying in the room is your best choice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: As for the teammates you’ve mentioned, they won’t refuse.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Huh?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows. </span><i><span style>The system sounds so sure. I don’t know these two people, why would they listen to me?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, before he could retort, the system sent another message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: Wait there for me!</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Original Chapter Teaser:</strong>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Someone's breaking in? Who could that be?</p>
 <p>Also… breaking into Mount Supreme!? How's that even possible! The seals here were placed by a Sovereign! That's supposed to be above the level of an Immortal King, and an Immortal King is already the strongest beings here! How the hell are they breaking through?</p>
 <p>Also, just what are they trying to do… Gah, this is way too frustrating…</p>
 <p>I have no time to waste… I have to figure out a way to do what Lil' Blues father asked of me… Its the least I can do to pay respect to that deceased old man.</p>
