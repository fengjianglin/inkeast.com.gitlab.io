 <p><span style>Chapter 13 – School Beauty Su Yan’s Red String of Marriage</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m going to ask if it is or not.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan pouted, then looked towards Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just now, did my grandpa drink… Hey, why is it you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan didn’t know Ye Zichen before, but due to all of the controversy caused by Ye Zichen in school recently, it would be hard for her not to know him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Su-Su Yan!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was the first time that Ye Zichen had spoken to the goddess at such a close distance. Furthermore, the goddess was the one who started speaking first, causing him to stutter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The old man was definitely a highly intelligent person at such an old age. Within only a few moments, he saw what was going on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You know each other.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s in the same university as me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan started to explain, while a light flashed across the old man’s eyes as he smiled towards Su Yan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, Grandpa will tell you the truth, Grandpa did drink. But don’t blame the lad, I was determined to bum a drink off him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But the doctor…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What about the doctor, is my darling granddaughter going to tell on me? What’s more, the doctor said that I can’t eat barbeque, didn’t you still sneak me here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The old man smiled and looked towards Su Yan with a hint of threat in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re being unreasonable.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan bit her lips in anger. She only brought Grandpa Su over was because she saw that he was too bored at home.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her act of goodwill actually was taken advantage of by Grandpa Su.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He, just pretend that grandpa is unreasonable. If you tell them about me drinking, then I’ll tell them that you took me to eat barbeque, then neither of us will end up well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan instantly stopped getting frustrated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what do you want to do!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s grandpa’s darling granddaughter. Go and buy grandpa two bottles of water to rinse my mouth, otherwise, it would be bad if your dad smells it on me when we get home.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can’t we buy it here? You can’t be just wanting to sneakily drink again, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is grandpa that sort of person, now go!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, I’ll believe you this one time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan left the barbeque store with a frown. Meanwhile, Ye Zichen’s gaze continued to remain on her retreating form.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As expected of the number one beauty in school, she was so pretty even when she was angry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, it seems like she didn’t put any makeup on!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>She was so beautiful without any cosmetics; then how beautiful would she be if she put makeup on?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Old Man Su saw Ye Zichen’s reactions completely. He only waved his hand in front of Ye Zichen after Su Yan’s figure could no longer be seen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Laddie.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen returned to his senses at that point. As he saw Old Man Su’s playful smile, he was clearly apprehensive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is your name?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen,” Old Man Su raised his head slightly, then indicated towards the direction Su Yan left in. “What do you think about my granddaughter?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was a bit confused by Old Man Su’s question, but he still replied honestly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Su Yan is a famous school beauty in our Polytechnic University. She’s pretty, kind and good at studying, basically, everything about her is good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that so!?” Hearing that, a meaningful smile flashed across his eyes. “How about we make a deal?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the way back to the school, Ye Zichen walked very slowly, but his heart was racing. It was merely because the school goddess, Su Yan, was beside him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, despite both of them walking together, neither had said a word.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a long while, Su Yan finally broke the silence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you reach some sort of agreement with my grandpa?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s heart beat quickly. Su Yan had truly guessed it right. However, Old Man Su had warned him many times that he should not say anything, so he could only reply forcefully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nope.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk, stop helping my grandpa hide it, I know everything.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan twitched her mouth and said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When he left, his waist was bulging so much. If I didn’t guess it wrongly, you probably bought alcohol for him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was already really beautiful, and she’s also so smart, what are other people going to do.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sighed heavily in his heart. He thought back to outside the barbeque shop and Su Yan’s appearance in stopping Old Man Su from drinking, so he quickly explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My wine is different from others, Old Man Su wouldn’t have an issue even if he drinks it, it will only be good for the body.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whatever, I never heard of any alcohol that is good for the body. But don’t worry, I won’t blame you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan smiled. Ye Zichen managed to see that smile, a simple smile from the goddess causing him to be awestruck all of a sudden...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So pretty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen replied idiotically. Su Yan blushed randomly after hearing it. She already heard this sort of things many times, but for some reason when Ye Zichen said it, it actually felt different to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In order to hide the changes in her heart, Su Yan shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, what are you spacing out for. My grandpa told you to make sure and escort me back to my dorm safely.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, oh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen quickly caught up, but he continued to check out the side of Su Yan’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan blushed slightly. All of a sudden, the atmosphere between the two of them actually seemed a bit strange.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh yeah, just what exactly is your identity? The school’s gossip site has been filled with loads of news about you recently.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan broke the silence once again. Ye Zichen patted his forehead helplessly and sighed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why is even the school beauty so into gossips?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All girls like to gossip, is the school beauty not allowed to be human!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan complained strangely, causing Ye Zichen to chuckle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As they chatted, the two of them had already returned to Su Yan’s dorm. Su Yan pursed her lips and waved towards Ye Zichen as she walked towards the dorm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ermm…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan suddenly turned around. Even she didn’t know why she would have such a drastic reaction to him. What was much more terrifying was that she actually was looking forward to something happening.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good night.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen finally said after hesitating for a long time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan didn’t know why, but there was actually a hint of sadness in her heart. However, she still replied with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You too, get some rest. I’m going back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen waved his hand towards Su Yan. When Su Yan’s figure had finally faded from his sight, Ye Zichen slapped his thighs and cursed at himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damn pussy! Is it so hard to just get a phone number!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was the goddess so easy to get into contact with? It was such a good chance, that might be permanently missed now that he had missed it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Ye Zichen was getting annoyed with himself…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Received Marriage String x1!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Marriage String?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clicked open the Treasure Chest, and saw a red string in it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Marriage String: Fate tied together by a string. Hand-made by Yue Lao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Possessor: Ye Zichen; Possessed: Su Yan</span></p>
 <p><span style>Current affability level: 10.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the heck is this thing?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was completely confused by the marriage string that had suddenly appeared. How did a marriage string appear when he and Su Yan had only just met?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Were he and Su Yan meant to be together?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But what’s this affability level mean? It doesn’t say how much is needed for them to be together!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
