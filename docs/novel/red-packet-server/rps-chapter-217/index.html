 <p><span style>Chapter 217 – Human? Ghost?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen wore a baseball cap and stood outside Jing Wan’s base after intentionally pushing down his the cap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To be honest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was extremely awkward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The base was right opposite his home. So, in order to prevent Ye Rong noticing him, Ye Zichen ended up acting like a thief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jing Wan-jie, someone’s pressing the doorbell, I’m going to open the gate,” Di Xinpeng took a look at Jing Wan, who was frowning heavily on the sofa.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Wan looked up and glanced outside the mansion gate.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The guy’s wearing a hat.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Thinking back to what happened when she streamed a while earlier, she quickly stopped Di Xinpeng, “Don’t go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened?” Di Xinpeng scratched his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Wan bit her lips, “Never mind, go and open the gate. I’m going upstairs. If that person is looking for me, then tell him that I’m not here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, she ran up to the second floor with his slippers. Meanwhile, Di Xinpeng scratched his head in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What happened?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The more in a hurry Ye Zichen felt, the more it seemed like the gate won’t be opened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had pressed the doorbell for a long time, but nobody came out of the mansion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Ye, is it because no one’s here?” Huang Yi couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows as he stood outside the gate and notice that the base did not react at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since nobody came to open the gate for so long, even Ye Zichen started to suspect that no one was inside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Creak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The door to the mansion opened, then Di Xinpeng wandered out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tell me who, hurry up and open the gate,” Ye Zichen took of his hat, then quickly put it on again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Di Xinpeng’s naïve face was covered with a hint of forcefulness when he saw Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, why did you come?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop bullshitting, hurry up and open the door,” Ye Zichen continuously urged. Di Xinpeng hesitated for a while, then opened the door outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen only took off his hat after entering the mansion, then he sat down on the sofa and kept on fanning himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where’s Jing Wan?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not here!” Di Xinpeng did not treat him nicely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This little fellow really held a grudge. Back then, Ye Zichen destroyed him, and stole his goddess…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He got mad just by seeing Ye Zichen!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I practiced League a lot recently, do you dare to solo again? This time, I definitely won’t lose to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen took a glance at the little fellow’s forceful expression and shrugged without care.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Even if he practiced for his entire life, he wouldn’t be able to beat me.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>In order to not hurt this child’s self-esteem, Ye Zichen indicated towards Huang Yi, who was looking around the mansion, “Go and play against him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Him?” Only then did Di Xinpeng put his attention onto Huang Yi. He was too intent on arguing with Ye Zichen that he didn’t notice Huang Yi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is he capable?” Di Xinpeng smiled in disdain. </span><i><span style>No matter what, I’m a Master on the China Telecom #1 server…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t be too proud, there are plenty of people better than you,” Ye Zichen stood up from the solo, then patted Huang Yi’s shoulder. “This brats wants to solo you, wreck him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that a good decision?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The people that can be in this mansion should be the team members, I didn’t even join yet, and now I have to solo a teammate.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>If I win, then he loses face.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>If I lose, then I lose face.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t think so much, just solo him. Beat him until he submits!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since the Big Brother Ye he trusted most said so, then he decided to just go with it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Di Xinpeng also hooked his fingers at Huang Yi before the two went off to solo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Jing Wan, who was on the second floor, heard the noise downstairs, she noticed that it didn’t seem to be the person she was worried about it being.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she took a peek down from the stairs, her eyes lit up when she saw that it was Ye Zichen, causing her to quickly run down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm? Didn’t that brat, Di Xinpeng, say that you aren’t here?” Since Ye Zichen had gotten ready to leave, he couldn’t help but be shocked when he saw Jing Wan come over. “This shitty brat, he actually dared to lie to me…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, I told him to say that,” Jing Wan smiled wryly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she saw Ye Zichen’s appearance at the gate, she thought that it was the fanatic from when she streamed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, Di Xinpeng’s angry roar was heard. Only then, did Jing Wan look back and notice Huang Yi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Him? He’s the top laner I got for you,” Ye Zichen pursed his lips and smiled. “Didn’t I take Xia Keke away? I was worried that you are lacking people here, so I got one for you. I’m telling you, he is so much better than Xia Keke.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“About this…” Jing Wan instantly revealed a joyous expression, then looked down and bit her lips. “I really don’t know how I should thank you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had been very worried after the misunderstanding about Di Xinpeng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She never expected Ye Zichen to send a top laner over to her so quickly after last time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s there to thank me for? I also hope that you can establish a super strong team and bring the world championship trophy back to our country.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If that’s really the case, then I feel like you can’t be missing from the team,” Jing Wan’s beautiful eyes sparkled as she smiled. “If you were here, then I have completely confidence to bring the trophy back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can you stop getting ideas about me?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows and smiled wryly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This girl was truly determined.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who told you to be so amazing!” Jing Wan smiled. At this moment, a suspicious-looking man suddenly appeared at the gate to the base.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Wan’s expression immediately changed when she saw the man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked over according to her gaze…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man dressed up in a similar manner to him earlier… like a thief!</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, that sneaky look also caused people to become suspicious of him, so Ye Zichen looked at him a few more times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The doorbell rang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Wan’s face turned grey like a frightened doe, as she fidgeted with the corner of her clothes and bit her lips, “Came, he really came…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What came? The hell are you talking about? Someone’s pressing the doorbell, are you not going to open the door?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows, then rolled his eyes at Jing Wan, who stood dumbly, frozen in place.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>She truly lacks hospitality, and now I, the guest, have to go and open the door.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen twisted his neck, then walked towards the mansion door. At this moment, Jing Wan also came back to her senses. When she wanted to stop Ye Zichen, it was already too late.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you doing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stood at the mansion gate, and looked at the young man standing outside the metal gate, who wore black-framed glasses and was about Ye Zichen’s height.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The guy had a pure otaku face, and when Ye Zichen thought back to what Jing Wan muttered just mere moments ago…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It can’t be a crazed fan of hers, right?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The glasses young man outside the gate was also shocked when he saw Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He raised his hand to push up his glasses, then gulped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did… you go bungee jumping at Extreme Park a few hours ago?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was Ye Zichen’s turn to be shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He glanced at the young man and raised his eyebrows, “How’d you know? You can’t be my fan that’s tailing me, right!?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It really is you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man outside the gate revealed a shocked expression, then he took a few steps back as if he saw a ghost.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn’t you-you-you-you die? Are you a human or a ghost!?”</span></p>
