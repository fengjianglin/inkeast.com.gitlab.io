 <p><span style>Chapter 603 – Unable to Withstand Even a Single Blow</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Liu’er frowned as she looked at the fatty who stood in front of the portal to the Demon Realm. It had already been several days since Ye Zichen had gone through the portal. As she thought more about it, she did feel a bit bad for making him go to that sort of dangerous place all alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, when she decided to go to the Demon Realm, Fatty Yin had appeared in their lands and stopped her and her group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior, just what are you trying to achieve by stopping us!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuan Hong, the Great Sage and co. also stood beside Su Liu’er. They were planning to go to the Demon Realm together, but they were stopped by Fatty Yin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you trying to seek your death by going to the Demon Realm?” Fatty Yin glanced at them with a solemn look on his chubby face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, you’re friends with Ye Zichen, right? We’re going to go save him,” Su Zhu said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty Yin glanced at her, then smiled randomly. “Of course I believe you. I, Lord Fatty, actually managed to get such a pretty wife. I hope that guy didn’t trick me, otherwise, I’ll beat him up no matter where he is.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you looking at me like that?” Su Zhu held herself by the shoulders, then stepped backwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty Yin rubbed his chin with a smile, “Don’t be so scared of me. You’re my wife in the future. We don’t know each other too well right now, so let’s get to know each other better?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you want to get to know her, then go on. Don’t try stop Old Sun from saving my bro!” The Great Stage stepped forward, and slammed down his staff onto the ground. “Hurry up and move aside before Old Sun attacks.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t even think about it. Nobody here can go there,” Fatty Yin strengthened his tone, and stared at everyone with his green pea-like eyes.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That guy emphasized that the Great Sage, who was in the golden armor, and Yuan Hong, as people I cannot allow to go over at any cost.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, Fatty Yin had asked that guy why that was the case. He was still able to recall the wry and self-mocking smile on that person’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I finally returned here to change history.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was all that person had said before patting Fatty’s shoulder and leaving. The reason Fatty Yin had come to the land of the fox yaos, was to fulfill what that guy had asked him…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>To stop them!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I, Old Sun, have a terrible temper…” Great Sage Sun scratched his face, then pointed forward with his Ruyi Jingu Bang. “Hurry up and move out of the way, or I’m going to be merciless!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the Demonic Dragon Palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The appearance of the white-shirted man surprised everyone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun frowned, then subconsciously moved backwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zeze, you’re in a rather pitiful state,” the man helped Ye Zichen sit up, he then took out a jade vial. From it, he took out a jade green pill and pushed it into Ye Zichen’s mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, he looked up towards Black Dragon up on the throne, and smiled, “Black Dragon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are you!?” Black Dragon glared at the person. Yet, the face of the man was a blur, so he couldn’t tell that the man looked like at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, from the man’s tone, Black Dragon could tell that the man was very familiar with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you know where this is? You actually dared to come here to act so outrageously.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s the Demon Realm, I’ve been here quite a few times,” the white-robed man smiled, then looked towards Gu Li with squinted eyes. “I wanted to point you in the right direction, but it seems like I thought too much into it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon looked at Gu Li with a confused frown. </span><i><span style>He haven’t been here for long, and no one else had come to the Demon Realm recently.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>This man actually knows me, as well as Gu Li.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahhh…” Ye Zichen, who had his eyes closed, begun to cough intensely. Not long later, he opened up his eyes. His wounds had already fully healed, and it was only because of the blood on his clothes that he looked absolutely terrible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re awake,” the white-robed man smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked up in confusion at the man, “You…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Came to save you,” the white-shirted man patted his shoulders, then smiled towards Lord Black Dragon. “I’m going to take him away. You got a problem with that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ridiculous!” Black Dragon stood up from the chair and laughed mockingly. “You want to take him away just like that? Are you taking us, the Demon Realm, seriously!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I really am not,” the man shrugged with a smile. He grabbed Ye Zichen by the shoulder and began to walk out. “Don’t get in my way. If anyone dares to attack me, then this won’t end as easily as this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Outrageous! Get them!” Black Dragon shouted the moment the white-shirted man finished speaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Twelve Demon Sovereigns left their seats at once, and blocked off the door to the palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ridiculous,” the white-shirted man curled his lips, and snorted. “Scram!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Twelve Demon Sovereigns standing in front of them, were sent flying, then fell onto the floor and coughed up blood. Both the Twelve Demon Sovereigns and Black Dragon had expresions of absolute shock.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>These are the strongest of our demons’ fighting force, yet, they were defeated by a mere word….</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>They couldn’t even withstand a single hit!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just how strong is this person!?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Even the Jade Emperor nor Great Emperor Equalling Heaven wouldn’t be able to do that!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re a person from up there,” Black Dragon gripped the armrests of his throne with a tremble.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The white-shirted man turned around and shrugged, “Perhaps, but regardless of where I’m from, I can tell you very clearly that you won’t be able to stop me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems like there’s something interesting going on here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment, a short young man with a strand of dog-tail grass in his mouth suddenly appeared in front of the Demonic Dragon Palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man had pitch black skin, curly purple hair, and eyes in the shape of crescent moons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mo Di!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was surprised. This person was someone he had met in the Modern Realm, he never expected to see him here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, it’s the son of a saint and a demon. What a coincidence,” the young man spat out the strand of grass and waved towards Ye Zichen. “Why did you come here to the Demon Realm? Oh wait, I forgot to comfort you. The place you lived seems to have been frozen, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kui Yin!” the white-shirted man smiled. However, Ye Zichen could sense that he was not as calm as he was while facing Black Dragon and the demons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re calling me?” the young man squinted his eyes and looked towards the white shirted man in confusion. </span><i><span style>I’ve never used this name before, but…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It sounds pretty nice.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, you like it, right? I gave you the name back then as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Although I don’t really remember you, but I like this name quite a lot. Alright, then I’ll be called Kui Yin from now on,” Kui Yin shook his head with a smile. Then, he slid his right foot backward, and released a suppressing aura from his body. “Even though you gave me my name, you… still have to die!”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Original Chapter Teaser:</strong>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Everybody turned around when they heard the announcement. From the demons' point of view, the one who had arrived was definitely a peculiar&nbsp;one. If he was someone who had come to aid Ye Zichen, then he couldn't be more foolish to announce his own arrival. Yet, if he was not and was someone of the Demon Realm... That only meant that he was a fool. Announcing his own arrival in such a loud voice was insulting and only meant that he was challenging Lord Black Dragon's authority.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Ye Zichen felt a bit more hopeful.&nbsp;<em>Is he here? Is the system finally here?&nbsp;</em><em>Ugh, f*ck him. Didn't he say that someone was going to protect me in the hall? Where the hell is that guy and what the heck is he doing right now? He didn't even speak up when I got this amount of shit done to me! What the hell!</em></p>
 <p><em>But... The system... He should be plenty strong. Perhaps... Even stronger than all the demons here. But... If he is, then why didn't he just come over to slaughter every single last one of them? That would have prevented all the incidents, disasters, and tragedies from happening. So... Why...</em></p>
