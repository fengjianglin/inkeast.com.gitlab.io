 <p>Chapter 419 – Break Down</p>
 <p>This was the first time Ye Zichen began to doubt himself. There were a few times previously when he wanted to become stronger when he felt powerless…</p>
 <p>However, in the end, becoming stronger only became an excuse for him to avoid things. Yet, that was before he began to doubt his existence.</p>
 <p>But this time…</p>
 <p>After experiencing everything, Ye Zichen was truly moved.</p>
 <p><em>If it wasn’t for me, then none of this would have happened. </em>In order to prevent the same sort of situation from happening in the future, Ye Zichen… kind of wanted to give up everything.</p>
 <p>Including his life.</p>
 <p>“Boss Ye, what bullshit are you saying!?” Wei Chen shot up from the chair and shouted with a red face. “What do you mean by your existence is a mistake? Everyone has a reason for existing, what’s more, you are the Yellow Emperor…”</p>
 <p>“I know I’m the Yellow Emperor!” Ye Zichen, who had been holding back, roared out. He grabbed his head and glared at Wei Chen viciously. “It’s because I’m the Yellow Emperor that all these troubles came to find me! But what did it result in? I am merely the Yellow Emperor’s reincarnation in name, and lack even a ten thousandth of his original strength… Just what is this!? Tell me, what exactly is this supposed to be?”</p>
 <p>He stood up from the chair and pointed outside the window…</p>
 <p>“Do you know who those abyssals from yesterday were? They were my college classmates! Do you know how old they are? They are merely twenty something. Dead… They’re all f*cking dead now! I killed them with my own hands! I… killed them with my very own hands,” Ye Zichen lifted his hands, while his eyes turned red. He clenched his teeth tightly and forcefully held back his tears, before he smiled wryly. “This pair of hands should have been used to protect them, but what happened? Do you know what I felt when they smiled towards me before they died? They didn’t want me to blame myself, but it merely looked like mockery in my eyes. They mocked me for being powerless. They mocked me for being unable to save them…”</p>
 <p>As Ye Zichen furiously expressed his sadness, Wei Chen suddenly turned silent.</p>
 <p>He was unable to comprehend what Ye Zichen felt, but he could feel that Ye Zichen was truly in great pain.</p>
 <p>“I really am afraid… afraid that one day, my friends, family, and even the strangers around me will disappear one around another. I’m afraid that I will have to use my hands, this pair of powerless hands, to kill the innocent again. In order to prevent that from happening, you might as well… Wait for the Yellow Emperor’s reincarnation next life. I’ve had enough!”</p>
 <p>All of a sudden, Ye Zichen’s palm radiated with golden light as he began to smack it towards his own head.</p>
 <p><em>I might as well die and end everything.</em></p>
 <p>Wei Chen, who stood on the side, did not expect Ye Zichen would do something like that. When he realized that he should be stopping Ye Zichen, it was already too late.</p>
 <p>“What a fragile little fellow. Boss Ye, this is very embarrassing for you,” Xiang-jie suddenly appeared in the room beside Ye Zichen. She lifted her hand and grabbed Ye Zichen’s arm with one hand, while tapping the middle of his eyebrows with a finger. “Technique of Composure!”</p>
 <p>Xiang-jie patted Ye Zichen’s shoulder softly, then pressed Ye Zichen back down onto the chair.</p>
 <p>Then, she squinted her eyes and turned towards Wei Chen. “What are you looking at? Doesn’t the White Tiger’s Body Double feel embarrassed about not even able to take care of someone? Go and send a message to the White Tiger, tell him to pass you thirty percent more power. The current you is unable to handle the situation anymore.”</p>
 <p>“You… I understand,” Wei Chen nodded silently, then glanced at Ye Zichen, who already closed his eyes. “I’ll leave him to you. Don’t stimulate him!”</p>
 <p>“You don’t need to worry about that. Hurry up and do what you should be doing!”</p>
 <p>Xiang-jie pushed Wei Chen out of the room, then sat beside Ye Zichen and pinched his cheeks softly, “Why are you keep getting more fragile from one life to the next? Seriously, the more I age, the more I worry. Sigh, you really cause me to worry too much!”</p>
 <p>A good half an hour later, Ye Zichen woke up. When he opened his eyes, he saw Xiang-jie’s face so close that it was almost on his own face, as she watched him closely.</p>
 <p>“Xiang-jie!”</p>
 <p>“You woke up? You don’t want to commit suicide anymore, right?” Xiang-jie smiled softly.</p>
 <p>Recalling the previous situation, Ye Zichen couldn’t help but blush and apologize, “Sorry, I kind of broke down…”</p>
 <p>“Don’t apologize towards me. Go and apologize to your family and your deceased friends! Seriously, you want to die and end everything, how can things be so easy in this world… Right now, what you represent is not only your own life. You have to live for all those deceased people, do you understand?” Xiang-jie lectured him.</p>
 <p>Ye Zichen sat beside her and nodded like primary schooler, “Understood, I’ll live for them.”</p>
 <p>“That’s a good boy!” Xiang-jie rubbed his hair, then stood up from the chair and yanked his arm towards the outside.</p>
 <p>“What?” Ye Zichen looked at her in confusion.</p>
 <p>Xiang-jie immediately raised her eyebrows in annoyance, “What do you think? Didn’t I tell you that I’ll take you to see that treasure after you become an Earth Immortal? What? You forgot!?”</p>
 <p>“Oh…” Ye Zichen nodded, then licked his lips and smiled wryly. “I don’t think I’ll go. It’s pointless even if I do go. Xiang-jie shouldn’t rely on me!”</p>
 <p>“You spouting that mess again? Little fellow, why do I feel like you’re naturally pessimistic… You only just said that you are going to live their share, and now you’re looking down on yourself again?”</p>
 <p>“Alright, alright. Fine, I'll go!” Ye Zichen shrugged helplessly.</p>
 <p>Seeing that, Xiang-jie smiled, “Now that’s a good boy!”</p>
 <p>With that, she grabbed Ye Zichen’s arm and giggled, “Close your eyes. Big Sis will take you to find treasure!”</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>Whoosh.</p>
 <p>Xiang-jie let go of Ye Zichen’s arm and clapped, “Okay, open your eyes!”</p>
 <p>Ye Zichen slowly opened his eyes. At the very beginning, he was not used to the darkness, but he felt like they were in a dark cave.</p>
 <p>“This is the place you talked about with the treasure?”</p>
 <p>“Of course,” Xiang-jie smiled, then snapped her fingers.</p>
 <p>Sizzle.</p>
 <p>Balls of fire suddenly ignited on the walls of the cave, illuminating the cave itself. At the same time, Ye Zichen also saw a sword stabbed within a circular platform in the middle of the cave.</p>
 <p>The sword seemed to have a long history, but there were no stains on it at all. What’s more, through the blade itself, Ye Zichen was able to feel a faint aura of an emperor.</p>
 <p>“This treasure…” Ye Zichen was stunned, then turned his head back in shock.</p>
 <p>At the same time, Xiang-jie also smiled, and pushed him forward…</p>
 <p>“Go, take back the glory is only yours.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Original Chapter Teaser:</b>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Everyone breaks down under pressure, and Ye Zichen is no different. Burdened with the destiny for being the Yellow Emperor's reincarnation, burdened with the loss of a girl he spent months to revive, burdened with the responsibility of his dead roommates, burdened with the duty of saving the world...</p>
 <p>Was that truly something that a twenty year old should bare upon his shoulders? Is he even supposed to be able to bare all of it as a more or less normal person? He may be a cultivator, but he is merely one that is at the very bottom of the food chain. Everyone is able to trample on him with ease...</p>
 <p>How is that the state the reincarnation of the Yellow Emperor, a great monarch, should be in? He has already suffered so much misfortune, perhaps, it was time for fate to balance things out...</p>
