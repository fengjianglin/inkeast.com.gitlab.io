 <p><span style>Chapter 518 – Jade Emperor has sent a friend request</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who can explain to me just why that woman was there?” Zuo Qingcheng knitted her eyebrows and looked at the people around her coldly after leaving the auction house.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn’t you all say that she was in the Endless Beast Region? Why was she at the auction house when I came over just now!? Who can give me an explanation?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Smash.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Qingcheng smacked the peach wood table into smithereens, but everyone in the room continued to stay silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a long time, a young man answered with a trembled, “Master told us that First Young Lady was in the Endless Beast Region. We didn’t say it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm?” Zuo Qingcheng squinted her eyes and looked at the young man before raising her eyebrows, “Why have I never seen you before?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve only just joined Treasure Tower…” the young man lowered his head as he replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since you are new, then you already dare to argue?” Zuo Qingcheng’s expression darkened even more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then suddenly, the young man tore at the area around his throat as if an invisible hand was choking him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone else in the room all lowered their heads and did not dare to say anything. Not long later, the young man levitated off the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He kicked out, while his eyeballs bulged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A good five minutes later, the young man’s struggle gradually began to weaken until he finally stopped struggling and was dropped onto the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Deal with him,” Zuo Qingcheng looked indifferently at the lifeless young man. When two people dragged him out, she spoke up once again. “Go and contact someone to destroy Zuo Mo’s auction regardless of the cost. Understood!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood!” the people in the room nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Qingcheng snorted, then smiled in satisfaction before the foxy smile surfaced on her face once again as she left the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen-ge, this is the room my sister arranged for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Liang led Ye Zichen to a room on the eighth floor of the auction house with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but shake his head with a soft sigh after seeing the arrangement of the room.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So luxurious.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>There were plenty of expensive spiritual items within, and just stepping into it caused everyone to feel like their pores opened up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you need anything, just press the bell by the window over here. There will be an attendant waiting outside to tend to your needs.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay,” Ye Zichen nodded with a smile. “Oh yeah, who was that woman just now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Her? She’s our second uncle’s child,” Zuo Liang raised her eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems like Zuo Mo isn’t on particularly good terms with her?” Ye Zichen asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It isn’t just now. They’re on extremely bad terms. They’ve always been like oil and water. What’s more, the Treasure Tower is planning to elect a new Tower Head. Both my sister and Zuo Qingcheng are good candidates, so their relationship naturally worsened.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t seem so hostile towards Zuo Qingcheng?” Ye Zichen raised her eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m different from them. My father actually died before I was born, and Zuo Mo-jie’s father adopted me in good will. I have no ambitions to become the Tower Head, so I naturally wouldn’t act like them,” Zuo Mo chuckled. “I’m leaving now since I still need to warm the audience up when the auction begins. If you need anything, just ask the attendant outside.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, then go and busy yourself. Don’t mind me,” Ye Zichen nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Zuo Mo walked out of the room, Ye Zichen sat down by the window, which allowed him to see how the auction was going.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen chose to take out his phone using the time before the auction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He clicked on Red Packet Server, and saw that the deities in the group were having a flame war once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Do you know just how long laozi endured you for? You’re blabbering on and on in the group with your alt. Do you dare to use your main!?</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Yeah. I have to watch you blabber every single day. Why are you so annoying?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: Dude, the Jade Emperor isn’t here, so even if you kiss ass here, he won’t be able to see!</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Fortune: What a retard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing used to be the peacemaker in the Heavenly Court’s chat group, but ever since he left the Heavenly Court, the task was left to Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King Li.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since he saw that the deities in the group were about to fight, he couldn’t help but try to calm them down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King Li: Everyone, just take a step back and leave it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Little Prince: Old Li, don’t mind me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Little Prince: Yang Jian, Zhao Gaoming, Old Pig and Lei Zhenzi, you guys are seeking death. You actually dared to challenge Heavenly authority.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Don’t bullshit if you can fight. Use your main account if you dare. See if laozi beats the shit out of you.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It seems like they are arguing with Little Prince.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>To be honest, Ye Zichen didn’t have any good impression of Little Prince. He had been speaking to the others like the big boss of the Heavenly Court from the get go. Since everyone in the group were real major deities, nobody could accept a suspicious person like him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Little Prince: Hehe…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Oh wow, you dare to hehe? Grandson, you are truly sick of living aren’t you. Speaking anymore is pointless. Fight me!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Little Prince: Hehe…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen kicked Little Prince out of the group the moment the message was sent.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This brat has been destroying the serenity of the group from the very beginning. I can’t allow such actions to proceed further.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Grandson, stop going hehe with laozi. Fight me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, I already kicked him out of the group,” Ye Zichen spoke up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Sky Sovereign is finally here. You should have kicked him out from the start. He’s been blabbering on and on and on these few days. He’s got a problem with us playing cards, with us chatting etc. So damn annoying!</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Fortune: Yeah: He’s lucky that laozi doesn’t know who he is. If I know, then… Hmph…</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Fortune’s meaning was obvious. If he knew who the kid was, he definitely would have dispersed all of the brat’s fortune.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Bro, you finally came. That brat was truly lucky, otherwise, I would have broken his leg.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King Li: Alright, calm down. He’s already out of the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Hmmph, never mind. I don’t want to care about that brat. Oh yeah, bro, since I’m not on duty today, how about I come down to play with you?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: Take Old Pig with you.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Are you guys going to find Sky Sovereign? He’s returned to the Heavenly Court?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: I want to go as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Little girl, don’t go. Watch your Immortality Peach Garden properly. Did the Queen Mother not punish you for the monkey stealing peaches? You really are forgetful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: My bro isn’t in the Heavenly Court, he’s over in the Immortal Region. You want to come?</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Immortal Region? Then never mind. I’m on duty today.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Fortune: I actually want to go quite a bit, but I can’t leave. If Sky Sovereign comes to the Heavenly Court, then let’s find a time and get together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: So only Old Pig and I will go. @Only Idealism, bro you free or not?</span></p>
 <p><span style>While the people in the group chatted about descending to go and find him, Ye Zichen felt his brain explode as he stared at a friend request.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jade Emperor sent a friend request.</span></p>
