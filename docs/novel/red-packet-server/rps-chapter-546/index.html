 <p><span style>Chapter 546 – The Seven Fairies Were in Danger</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qiu Yuan kicked the door open and left for the city, leaving the old city lord Qiu smiling wryly, while hints of tears flickered in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“City lord!” A long-haired man in a warrior entered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The old city lord let out a sigh, “Li Zhi, take some people to go and search for the key. It is for the best if you can find it. If you can’t, then… never mind.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood!” Li Zhi cupped his fist and left the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then the old city lord let out another long sigh once again before the also departed with a shake of his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Outside the city lord’s manor the next morning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Ye, why not stay a few more days?” Qiu Yuan stood at the entrance and sent Ye Zichen off without the old city lord.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I still have urgent business to take care of for this trip, so I won’t trouble you too much here. I’ll come to the city lord manor and find you after I’m done with everything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, the earth dragon carriage was also drove over by the driver. Seeing it, Ye Zichen cupped his hands towards Qiu Yuan and smiled, “See you soon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>As they sat on the earth dragon carriage, Zuo Mo took out a map, “We should be here right now. It’ll take at least six hours for us to reach Mount Biluo.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm, okay,” Ye Zichen nodded, then took out his phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was a man of his word, and so he would definitely do what he promised Earth Traveler Sun. Since they weren’t yet to Mount Biluo, he took out his phone and was going to chat with the Jade Emperor about it, only to think of the private video the Seven Fairies had sent him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen took a glance at Zuo Mo. When he saw that she was resting her eyes, he clicked on the video.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Purchasing this video requires a hundred thousand cultivation experience. Would you like to continue?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Yes.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A familiar tune sounded out. The background music was the song that Ye Zichen played while the fairies practiced, but the screen was completely black for five minutes…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehehe, you got tricked!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Ye Zichen was wondering why there was no video, Seventh Fairy suddenly sent him a message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The cultivation experience from him purchasing the video naturally went over to them, so they knew that he clicked on it after he paid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“… you actually dare to mess with this sovereign,” Ye Zichen was completely speechless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seventh Fairy giggled, “Hehehe, what is Sky Sovereign doing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve naturally been busy,” Ye Zichen replied. “Why are you girls so free? Don’t you need to go and practice? I’m telling you, you have to work hard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay. We’re just resting for a little while,” Seventh Fairy said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How was the concert yesterday?” Ye Zichen asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The concert?” Seventh Fairy twitched her mouth, then shrugged. “It didn’t go particularly well. Someone came to wreck the concert yesterday. Fortunately, Canopy Marshal and Yang Jian were both here, otherwise, we might have been in danger.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wreck!?” Ye Zichen frowned.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That’s the Heavenly Court, someone actually dares to do something to the Jade Emperor’s daughters!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Has the culprit been caught?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not yet, but our imperial father is furious. He has already sent out the entire army to investigate this. He also forbid us to not go out and about recently, then told us to stay home,” said Seventh Fairy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, just stay home properly. It might be very dangerous for you to go out. Practice with your sisters, I’m going to find out about the situation from other people.” Ye Zichen replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, okay,” Seventh Fairy replied with a giggle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After that, Ye Zichen went straight to the Red Packet Server, and saw that the group was actually talking about the Seven Fairies getting endangered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King Li: I hope everyone can actively provided us with any information you might have.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: Don’t be in such a hurry. Wait for Yang Jian’s news. He gave chase, and might be able to help you when he comes back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: But the person who came to cause trouble didn’t look like someone from the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Barefoot Immortal: Indeed. There was a very evil aura radiating from his body. If this sovereign bump into him, I definitely have to cast a spell of mind purification on him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: Why did they come to destroy the concert?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: There are too many possibilities. No matter what, we must investigate this thoroughly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jade Emperor: Yes, everything must be investigated thoroughly. They actually dared to bully this emperor’s daughter. They really are seeking death!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was unable to get any useful information from their chat. The only helpful piece of news was that Yang Jian had given chase.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He raised his eyebrows, then quit the group and clicked on his chat with Yang Jian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are they, please reply when you receive the message.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen returned his phone to his pocket after sending the news. When he looked up once again, he saw Zuo Mo staring right at him. “Huh? Why are you looking at me like that!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Anyone would feel awkward in that sort of situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Zuo Mom merely blinked, and supported her head with her hands, “When did I start to stick to you every single day? I have never been so close to a man before!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Never mind, pretend I never said anything,” Zuo Mo shook her head. “Let’s talk. What price are you paying me if I help you find that jade pendant?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You want a price?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, I’m a merchant. I care only about profits. As the young lady of the Treasure Tower and the future successor of the Treasure Tower, wouldn’t it be wrong if you don’t give me anything when I go around with you every single day?” Zuo Mo raised her eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fine, fine, fine, then tell me what do you want!” Ye Zichen replied speechlessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I haven’t decided yet. I’ll tell you when I have. Oh yeah, don’t say that I haven’t reminded you, Mount Biluo is the resting grounds of half-beastmen, it is very dangerous,” Zuo Mo replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen has already heard a lot about Mount Biluo’s danger, but he didn’t have a choice when the situation was forcing him to go to the dangerous place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, so what if Mount Biluo is dangerous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His journey till that point was not the safest either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A call suddenly sounded out outside the carriage. Hearing that, the carriage stopped as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who is inside? Tell them to come down to be investigated.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What now?” Zuo Mo bit her lips and revealed a look of displeasure. </span><i><span style>We haven’t been in peace ever since coming over here. Just how terrible is the security over here? Someone actually dares to block us off in broad daylight.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, a conversation between the driver and the other person sounded out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, that person clearly didn’t believe the driver’s words, since he rolled up his sleeves and walked over, “What Treasure Tower? I don’t know it. Since you don’t want to accept investigation, then don’t fault me for using violence.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoosh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person pushed the curtains over, causing Ye Zichen and Zuo Mo to both manipulate their spiritual energy in preparation for a fight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, both of them were completely shocked when they saw the person in front of the carriage door, and the other person had the exact same reaction as them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did you come over here?”</span></p>
