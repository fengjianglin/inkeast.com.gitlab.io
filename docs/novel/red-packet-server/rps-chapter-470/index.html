 <p><span style>Chapter 470 – Protect My Daisy</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Liang put on an expression as if he was watching a show, while he snickered stealthily on the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The chance to see Zuo Mo getting stuffed was too addicting. </span><i><span style>It’s his fault that he keeps on bullying at me at home. It’s great, now he has met his match.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Mo also frowned, dissatisfied. He had never met a man who treated him like that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, this sort of person only triggered his curiosity, causing him to want to speak more with that man. “I don’t want to do anything!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you don’t want to do anything, then move aside. Otherwise, laozi’s going to beat you up!” Ye Zichen glared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Mo twitched his mouth and smiled, “You…?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His eyes were filled with disdain as a spiritual aura no weaker than a Human Immortal’s was released from his body. “You want to beat me up?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Damn it, why does is a sissy so strong? </span></i><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes speechlessly, even though that level of spiritual pressure was of no threat to him. “Stop showing off. If you have something to say, then speak. If you don’t, then leave!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both Zuo Mo and Zuo Liang raised their eyebrows in shock when they saw that he was completely fine.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This person is hiding his strength.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>They had both detected Ye Zichen’s strength to be around that of a False Spiritual Body. When Zuo Liang said that he was strong, they both thought that Ye Zichen was genius at body cultivation. Only now did they realize that he was intentionally hiding his strength!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Interesting.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, Zuo Mo only got more interested in him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He squinted his eyes, and stopped releasing the spiritual pressure, “I wonder which of the Six Pavilions or Three Gates you are from?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The places you spoke of are too high-leveled. I’m just a small miner from Spiritual Breeze Village,” Ye Zichen replied straightforwardly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Miner? Alright, then are you interested in following me? I can give you a wage of a thousand celeste per day. How about that?” Zuo Mo smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen scratched his head, and twitched his mouth, “I refuse!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Too little?” Zuo Mo raised his eyebrows. “Then ten thousand!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even if you give me a million, I am not interested,” Ye Zichen shrugged helplessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can you tell me the reason?” Zuo Mo smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m worried that you have an abnormal sexual preference. If I follow you, then my daisy that I’ve protected for twenty something years will have to bloom with you. I have to protect my daisy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…” Zuo Mo bit his lips softly, while his face flushed as red as an apple.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Zuo Liang couldn’t help but laugh loudly on the side as he slapped his thigh. After a while, he raised his eyebrows, “Bro, actually, he…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shut up!” Zuo Mo glared at Zuo Liang angrily. Then he turned back towards Ye Zichen. “Wow. I’ve remembered you now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop thinking about my flower. Even if you think about it all the time, this flower wouldn’t be yours!” Ye Zichen replied indifferently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Liang laughed even harder, and nearly fainted. After a long while, he finally came back to his senses, then put his hand on Zuo Mo’s shoulder, “Let’s go. No matter what you say, this bro isn’t going to leave with you. Or, you could try and strip?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck off!” Zuo Mo cursed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, alright. The auction’s about to start. Don’t forget our reason for coming here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Seriously…” Zuo Mo bit his lips once again, then stomped his feet like a girl before snorting. “Let’s leave!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the Zuo brothers left, Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows and looked at the direction they left in. </span><i><span style>Auction? That sort of place should have plenty of treasures!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Perhaps I can find the Barrier Breaking Grass there!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen immediately felt uncomfortable when he remembered that Zuo Mo would be there as well.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Never mind, I’ll be more careful so he won’t see me. I’ll go over and take a look to see if there is any Barrier Breaking Grass!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was able to enter the auction without any issues.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The auction house was split into nine floors. The first six were the normal trading areas, where various shopkeepers sold things like different ores, spiritual herbs etc.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, the seventh to ninth floor were for the auction. The seventh floor was the normal area, while the eighth and ninth floor were the VIP areas that only people with an impressive background could stay in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen naturally sat down in the normal area on the seventh floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he entered the auction house, Ye Zichen had acquired a lot of new information. The auction house itself was actually established by the Treasure Tower, and the coming auction as going to be hosted by the Treasure Tower’s people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rumors said that the Treasure Tower only had rare or valuable items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, those who sat on the seventh floor were mostly just there to see the show and learn something, while the ones who could afford to put up a price in the auction sat on the eighth and ninth floors.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, it wasn’t like all of the seventh floor’s customers would not be able to, since the phrase “experts are amongst civilians” did not come from nowhere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everyone, thank you very much for attending the Treasure Tower’s Auction. We, the Treasure Tower, have always kept pointless chatter to the minimum, so let us now begin the auction for the first item!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two servants brought up a plate covered in a red cloth onto the stage, then flipped the cloth over, revealing a lance…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Earth Grade Spiritual Treasure – The Wind Shattering Lance! This spiritual treasure was crafted by the item refining expert Bai Ling. The artifact itself carries a fire attribute attack, so friends with a fire attribute spiritual energy, you can start bidding. Of course, I won’t stop friends with spiritual energy of a different attribute to bid if you would like to collect it…” The host smiled on the stage, while the people begun to bid maniacally.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen was stunned.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Isn’t that Zuo Liang?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck, doesn’t that mean that sissy and him are both people of the Treasure Tower!?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>No wonder they could offer ten thousand celeste per day to me. The Treasure Tower’s people are truly rich!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But what the hell are they talking about? Earth grade spiritual artifact, fire attribute attack, item refining expert…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Although Ye Zichen was completely dumbfounded by everything, he did notice that the final price of the weapon was nine hundred celeste…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This should be really expensive, right?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I do remember that the most expensive weapons from what I saw on the sixth floor was a hundred something thousand…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Nice, Wind Shattering Lance is sold for nine hundred thousand celeste. Congratulations to the lucky gentleman. Our staff will contact you shortly. Now, let us start revealing the second item.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, the bidding for twenty items occurred without any break in between. All of them were sold at a price between five hundred thousand to two million. Ye Zichen did a rough calculation, and the auction house had gotten nearly thirty million in about half an hour…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This is truly a crazily profitable industry if I assume that they take a five percent commission.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, Zuo Liang immediately left the stage after auctioning the twenty items. Yet, the customers did not show any strange expressions, and instead put on more heated and anticipatory gazes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoosh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A long-haired lady walked out from behind the curtains.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Screams sounded out though the auction house the moment she appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shh,” the lady put her finger on her lips with a smile, causing the entire place to suddenly turn quiet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen was even more quiet…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>My god, am I a f*cking retard? </span></i><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but retort, then shook his head with a speechless expression as he looked at the woman on the stage. </span><i><span style>So this Zuo Mo was actually a girl!</span></i></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Original Chapter Teaser:</strong>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p><b>Zuo Liang:&nbsp;</b>Ahahahahaha</p>
 <p><strong>Zuo Mo:&nbsp;</strong>You..!</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>C'mon, just let me off already.</p>
 <p><strong>Zuo Mo:&nbsp;</strong>No! (pouts)</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Ugh. Then seriously, tell me exactly do you want?</p>
 <p><strong>Zuo Mo:&nbsp;</strong>I said it already. I don't want anything.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Then can you leave me alone?</p>
 <p><strong>Zuo Mo:&nbsp;</strong>No?</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Then stay away from me. (shudders)</p>
 <p><strong>Zuo Mo:&nbsp;</strong>Why are you looking at me like that?</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Please stay away from me. I'm a straight dude.</p>
