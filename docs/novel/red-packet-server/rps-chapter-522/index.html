 <p><span style>Chapter 522 – Trouble</span></p>
 <p><span style>The auction naturally was unable to continue with such a fiasco occurring again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Mo sent the audience apologetically, while Ye Zichen brought over a chair from the backstage and sat down to look at Shi Qian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did you become a robber?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t put it so terribly, alright? I’m a thief!” Shi Qian replied in annoyance. “Honor amongst thieves, have you never heard of that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmph, fine! Then why did you come to rob, no, steal… Why did you repeatedly come to steal from the Treasure Tower?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Treasure Tower is rich,” Shi Qian licked his lips. “Laozi doesn’t use whatever I steal. Laozi is a gentleman thief. Laozi gives all the treasures I steal to those civilians who can’t even afford to pay for their daily necessities.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows when he heard that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Shi Qian continued, “The first time I came, it was because I didn’t understand the situation well. I thought the Treasure Tower ripped civilians off. After returning, I went to research a bit and found out that the Treasure Tower would often give food to the poor. That’s why I decided not to steal from them anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But you still came again,” Ye Zichen smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The situation this time is different,” Shi Qian waved. “Someone contacted me this time and told me to destroy this auction. I wanted to refuse, but the offer was too alluring. Thus, I decided to go against my morals and do it. I never expected to bump into this big bro once again!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Qian looked over at Yang Jian with a tearful expression, then raised his eyebrows. “Oh yeah, if we’re talking about robbery, this big bro is the real robber. He robbed me of the stuff &nbsp;laozi stole last time. Why aren’t you guys capturing him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s my bro. He returned the stuff he got from you back to the Treasure Tower,” Ye Zichen replied calmly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Mo, who stood on the side, smiled, “No wonder this savior didn’t want anything except the Barrier Breaking Grass. That was your decision, wasn’t it? I was wondering where you got the ingredients from when you gave me the Barrier Breaking Pills.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahem…” Ye Zichen coughed, then quickly changed the topic by turning towards Shi Qian. “You said just now that someone told you to destroy this auction?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!” Shi Qian answered resolutely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who?” Ye Zichen squinted his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Mo’s expression also darkened upon hearing that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In her perspective, the people who would want to destroy the auction were limited. Currently, the Tower Head was going to be elected once again, so the other party was definitely going to make things difficult for her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As long as they could ruin the elders’ impression of her, then those other people might be able to take the opportunity and raise to the top.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The person who went to find me was an old man, he was rather strong… Part of the reason I came was because I was forced by this old man. Although I’m good at escaping, I can’t really do much against a Sky Immortal!” Shi Qian shrugged and smiled wryly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen and Zuo Mo looked at each other.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Old man.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Sky Immortal!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The two of them were able to see that they had thought of the same possibility.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment, Elder Lin, who had not yet appeared, hurried up from the sixth floor. When he saw Shi Qian, who had been suppressed, his expression froze…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, yes, yes. It’s that old man!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Treasure Tower people looked over, and revealed shocked expressions when they saw that it was Elder Lin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Mo smiled meaningfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noticing everyone’s strange demeanors, he immediately walked over and asked as if he didn’t know what was going on, “What’s going on? This old man noticed there was something strange to the North, so I went over to take a look.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Elder Lin, are you sure?” Zuo Mo smiled faintly. “This divine thief just told me that you asked him to destroy this auction.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ridiculous!” Elder Lin’s expression sank. He rolled up his sleeves to his elbow, then quickly walked in front of Shi Qian with a snort. “Just kill a scum like him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His right hand flared up, and an intense killing intent could be felt from his body as he smacked his hand towards Shi Qian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Elder Lin, why are you in such a hurry? Wouldn’t we know if it is actually ridiculous after we confront each other?” Ye Zichen raised his hand and stopped Elder Lin’s attack. Even though Ye Zichen had two layers of protection on him, the attack still turned his arm numb, and the blood in his chest to boil.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Qian, who stood behind Ye Zichen, was rather surprised…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This brat saved me.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen,” Zuo Mo quickly supported Ye Zichen with a worried look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both Yang Jian and Zhu Ganglie glared at Elder Lin and wished to attack him for daring to attack their bro.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yang Jian, Old Pig!” Ye Zichen called sullenly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both Yang Jian and Zhu Ganglie retreated with a frown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shitty brat, you dare!?” Elder Lin’s heart was filled with shock. </span><i><span style>My enraged smack was actually stopped by that brat.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He was indeed the one who had sought Shi Qian out. Since the title of the divine thief was not just for show, he thought that Shi Qian would be able to fulfill his task.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His return was supposed to be perfectly timed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Shi Qian succeeds, he would be able to use the opportunity to complain to the Council of Elders about Zuo Mo’s faults. He never expected Shi Qian to be caught.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since he would not allow his actions to come to light, he… could only shift the blame.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Lady, this brat has been colluding with Shi Qian. They actually have ill intentions towards you. You should know very clearly that I’m on your side. The reason they’ve blamed me is to weaken your influence in the clan! Young Lady, think about how wholeheartedly Old Lin has worked for you all these years. Don’t you believe me?” Elder Lin kneeled onto the floor, and spoke in a manner that caused others to be moved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen merely smiled towards him, while Zuo Mo laughed coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, wholeheartedly. You want to say that Ye Zichen got close to me under Qingcheng’s orders?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This old man is uncertain, but he definitely isn’t a good person,” Elder Lin glared with bloodshot eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old man, you really are shameless. I, Divine Thief Shi Qian, have always been completely truthful. It was clearly you who told laozi to wreck this place. You even said that after it’s done, all of the treasures would be mine, and you would even give me three percent of the Treasure Tower’s profits. It has nothing to do with this little bro at all. You’re actually trying to shift the blame?” Shi Qian retorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Lin merely snorted, “Listen to what’s wrong with your words. It’s one thing that the treasures all belong to you, but three percent of the profits afterwards? This old man is merely the leader of the Guest Chamberlain Council, how could I possibly give you such conditions.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are truly shameless!” Shi Qian roared in anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Mo, who stood on the side, also raised her eyebrows and smiled. “How is it impossible? As long as you drag me down, Qingcheng will be able to rise, and when she does, so will her dogs. How is it... impossible for you not to give this sort of condition?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Lady!” Elder Lin said frantically. “Why don’t you believe me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, what do you think we should do?” Zuo Mo ignored Elder Lin, who kneeled on the floor, and looked towards Ye Zichen, who had turned silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kill him,” Ye Zichen squinted his eyes. “Leaving someone like him behind is leaving trouble on your doorstep.”</span></p>

 <p></p>
 <p><b>Zuo Mo:&nbsp;</b>Let's start from the very beginning then. Who are you?</p>
 <p><strong>Shi Qian:&nbsp;</strong>(looks at Ye Zichen)&nbsp;I said I'll answer everything you ask me, not her...</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Just answer the damn question.</p>
 <p><strong>Shi Qian:&nbsp;</strong>Okay. I'm Shi Qian, the divine thief.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Why are you here?</p>
 <p><strong>Shi Qian:&nbsp;</strong>To steal stuff.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Again? Even though you failed last time?</p>
 <p><strong>Shi Qian:&nbsp;</strong>Yes.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Why?</p>
 <p><strong>Shi Qian:&nbsp;</strong>Because I was asked to. I didn't want to try again anymore, but the offer was truly too tempting.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Oh? Tell me more?</p>
 <p><strong>Shi Qian:&nbsp;</strong>Some old guy literally just contacted me not so long ago and asked me to hurry up and come over here to destroy the auction at all cost.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>So you just... did as he said?</p>
 <p><strong>Shi Qian:&nbsp;</strong>Yeah, he promised to give me five percent of the Treasure Tower's annual earnings.</p>
