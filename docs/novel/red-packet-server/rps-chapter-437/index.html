 <p><span style>Chapter 437 – Su Yiyun’s Strength</span></p>
 <p><span style>The slash shot through the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was so mighty that even the space itself was about to be cut open by it. The stones on the ground continuously exploded into smithereens and followed the ray like the trail of a comet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, hurry up and dodge it!” Xuan-Yuan Xiang called out from within the sword. Even she was shocked by the slash.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That guy has clearly gotten a grasp of the enlightenment of swords. This sword of sword intent would be able to increase his strength by at least ten times.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, what are you blanking out for? Hurry up and move aside!” Xuan-Yuan Xiang was beyond worried when she saw that Ye Zichen did not move. She even wanted to use her own strength to drag him away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t move.” At that moment, Ye Zichen spoke softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Xuan-Yuan Xiang immediately scolded angrily in his consciousness, “What bullshit are you saying? Do you actually want to block it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm,” Ye Zichen nodded, then gripped the hilt of the sword tightly with his right hand and lifted his arm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey… Don’t be reckless!!” Xuan-Yuan Xiang said. If Ye Zichen failed to block it, then both of them were going to be goners.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t be afraid,” Ye Zichen smiled. He looked up, at the slash that was approaching him…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is this your determination?” Ye Zichen shook his head, then let out a sigh. “If this is your determination, then that is truly disappointing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A savage aura was instantly released from Ye Zichen’s body, shocking even Xuan-Yuan Xiang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This…”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Even a complete stage Human Immortal might not be able to match this!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I chose to burden countless crimes in order to gain Xuan-Yuan Sword. In terms of determination, you’re way too lacking!” the light on Xuan-Yuan Sword’s blade brightened. Then, Ye Zichen glanced forward deeply. “Slash!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he waved Xuan-Yuan Sword downwards, it released a long slash that was over fifty meters in length.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment the slash materialized, the Otherworld shook, and a huge crack appeared on the ground…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shatter!” As Ye Zichen shouted, the air pressure from his slash directly broke Gu Li’s without stopping, then continued towards Gu Li.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Im-Impossible!” Gu Li’s eyes twitched intensely as he shook his head. He was unable to believe that the wind slash filled with his determination was shattered so easy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry up and run. What are you blanking out for!?” Diyou roared angrily within Chiyou Sword, but Gu Li was already out of his senses.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Diyou cursed, then controlled Chiyou Sword to move out of Gu Li’s hand. He did not want to die together with a retard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, you’re actually abandoning your master as a sword spirit. That is truly… shameful,” a playful laughter sounded out from beside Diyou. Before he could react, he was grabbed by someone. At the same time, the man also walked beside Gu Li and looked towards the wind slash… “You grew up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A huge palm suddenly appeared from the sky, which gripped the wind slash and shattered it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, brat, come back,” the man kicked Gu Li.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did Gu Li return to his senses. Seeing the young man in front of him, he immediately grabbed the young man’s trousers and shouted, “Kill him, kill that guy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck off. Why are you so annoying!?” the young man kicked Gu Li away, then looked towards Ye Zichen with a smile. “Zichen, long time no see!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Su Yiyun,” this time, Ye Zichen was very calm. He gazed at the man standing more than a hundred meters away from him. “Even a split second ago, I didn’t believe that you actually joined the demon race, but it seems like I have to believe it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, you’re still so friendly!” Su Yiyun smiled, then shrugged. “I came over this time for this brat. I heard that he’s a Fallen, and the demon race is very worried about him, so I have to bring him back safely.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I feel like that’s not going to happen,” Ye Zichen smiled, then walked forward. However, within a few steps, he felt like he was trapped within a barrier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi, you should know me. I won’t fight fights that I have no confidence in winning. I already set seals around you when I arrived.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Being a formation master is truly not just for show. Wow… Ol’ Three, you became strong.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve always been strong. Alright, let’s stop catching up. I’m… taking this guy away,” Su Yiyun smiled, then grabbed Gu Li’s collar and begun to leave…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A huge commotion suddenly sounded out in the air the moment he turned around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re trying the same thing again. DO you think that I will fall for the same trick?” Ye Zichen smiled, and walked over as he held Xuan-Yuan Sword, while continuously waving the blade in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of those were the seals Su Yiyun set around him!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, Su Yiyun suddenly smiled. He did not set up any spiritual formations and merely waited until Ye Zichen walked in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Leave him behind, and you can walk away,” Ye Zichen lifted Xuan-Yuan Sword and said coldly as he pointed towards Gu Li, who was sitting limply on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you still want to let me go even now?” Su Yiyun smiled wryly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Li snorted with a frown, “Su Yiyun, stop wasting your breath with him. Just directly kill him… He is the reincarnation of the Yellow Emperor. Xuan-Yuan Sword proves it all!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Laozi doesn’t recognize the Xuan-Yuan Sword!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun kicked Gu Li, then looked up once again, “How is Su Yan?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thanks to you, she is lying peacefully in the ward,” Ye Zichen’s hands trembled when he replied, but he forced himself to not show any other emotions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that so? She’s actually still alive!” Su Yiyun smiled darkly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, that completely pissed Ye Zichen off, “Are you still f*cking human? Still alive? She’s your little sister!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve said it before, that thing is not my little sister!” Su Yiyun squinted his eyes and replied. Then he grabbed Gu Li off the ground. “That’ll be all. I’m rather busy with the demon race, so I have no time to waste with you. I’m off!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you think that you can take him away?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen took a large step forward, only to find out that he was once again a hundred meters away from Su Yiyun, even though he was clearly right in front of them moments earlier.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck, I was tricked.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clenched his fist angrily. When he tried to chase them…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi, see you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen punched the ground. He never expected that Su Yiyun’s skills in spiritual formation to reach such a huge height that would allow him to set one up in an instant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Illusionary Lost Formation. That’s a spiritual formation that only a Level Six Formation Master can set up. What’s more, even if they set it up, they would require spirit stones and time. Your friend… is slightly too outrageously strong,” Xuan-Yuan Xiang also appeared out from the sword, then sighed. “Alright, he already left. Let’s go over and see how that old man is. You didn’t win this time, but you didn’t lose. You have already done very well against a formation master.”</span></p>
