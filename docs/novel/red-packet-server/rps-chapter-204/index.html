 <p><span style>Chapter 204 – I’m watching over it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at the ancient log with a face full of disdain.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the hell?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s been burnt into charcoal.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The system has detected Azure Wood Charcoal, an item needed for Immortal Heart of Pure Yang Level 3.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Required Items for Immortal Heart of Pure Yang Level 3 activated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azure Wood Charcoal x1, Spring-Returning Pill x10, Rootless Water x5 liters</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who had been looking at the piece of wood in disdain, immediately snatched the wood up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Deal!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Tian looked at the ancient wood that had left his hand with shock, then glanced at Ye Zichen, who was holding it with loving care…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Ye, I didn’t tell you what the deal is yet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s true.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows, then held out the azure wood reluctantly. </span><i><span style>An item needed for upgrading the Immortal Heart of Pure Yang is naturally good, but if the proposed deal was way too difficult…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Then it wouldn’t be worth the hassle.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Tell me, what sort of deal do you want to make?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Tian smiled, then raised his hand to scratch his smoke-colored hair, “Brother Ye should be able to communicate with people from the Underworld, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aren’t you asking a bit too much?” Ye Zichen smiled and squinted his eyes. He wasn’t sure of this brat’s background yet, so he couldn’t say things carelessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Ye, don’t be too worried,” Gu Tian smiled. “I won’t hide it from you. I’m actually one of the younger generation of the Gu family, one of the hidden families. I am also one of the successors to the position of the young family head. However, I am not as capable as my brothers in terms of other measures, so I’m pretty much eliminated from being chosen!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The heck does that have to do with me?” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes. “Go and solve the problems of the hidden families yourselves. Even if you come and complain to me, I can’t help you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Other people might not be able to help, but Brother Ye definitely can,” Gu Tian smiled and stretched lazily. “We, the Gu family are rather special. Other families might purely belong to the Underworld’s faction or the Heavenly Court’s faction, but we, the Gu family worship both realms. We worship the Two Impermanence Lords and Four Great Spiritual Monkeys… In the past few generations, we were still able to communicate with the people from the Underworld and from the Heavenly Court. However, our family has declined, and we are unable to see people from the Underworld and the Heavenly Court in our current generation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It would be weird if you could see them, alright?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes speechlessly. </span><i><span style>The Heavenly Court and the Underworld are on the verge of fighting.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>A puny family like you actually didn’t take a side, and chose to be neutral…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>If I were someone from the Underworld or the Heavenly Court, I would ignore you guys as well.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen was able to hear some useful information in Gu Tian’s words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The hidden families were normally one of the branches of the three realms, they would have ones they worship in their families…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Doesn’t that mean that if he could get on good terms with all the people from the Heavenly Court and the Underworld, and become brothers with them, these people from the hidden families would have to call him a lord!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, Ye Zichen started to laugh idiotically. Gu Tian looked at him in shock, then waved his hand in front of Ye Zichen’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Ye!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Here!” Ye Zichen quickly wiped away the saliva from the corner of his mouth, then raised his eyebrows. “How do you want me to help you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want Brother Ye to help me find a ghost servant during our family meeting in order to support me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s that simple?” Ye Zichen thought that Gu Tian would want him to find the Two Impermanence Lords, but he merely wanted a ghost servant from the Underworld.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck, I’m already a ghost servant in the Underworld!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I’m a Level 4 Ghost Servant!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, if a mortal like him went over to the Gu household and told others that he’s a ghost servant, it would be fortunate for him to not get beaten to death. However, he knew White Impermanence, with their relationship…</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, the bodyguards beside him are the descendants of those Four Great Spiritual Monkeys!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Regardless of Gu Tian wanting people from the Underworld or the Heavenly Court.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It was simple.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“If your request is that simple, then deal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Snatch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen snatched back the Azure Wood Charcoal that he had just given to Gu Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Spring-Returning Pill was a pill that only cost a hundred cultivation experience in the Treasure Shop, and he had several liters of rootless water.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I am definitely going to level up the Immortal Heart of Pure Yang.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Is Brother Ye speaking the truth?” Gu Tian merely wanted to ask. He never would have thought that something that several generations of people from the Gu family was unable to do was so easy when it came to Ye Zichen…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s such a tiny thing, what’s to be surprised about.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Buzz…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The phone in Ye Zichen’s pocket rang. Ye Zichen looked at the caller ID, then placed the phone by his ear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, Zhuge Kongming’s childish, yet anxious call sounded out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen-ge, someone came to trash our shop!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen instantly frowned.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Went to trash my shop? Are these people sick of living?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait a bit, I’ll be right there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen turned his head to look at Gu Tian, “Start driving, take me to this place…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the entrance to Ye Zichen’s supermarket.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhuge Kongming’s face shone with a faint white light within a golden barrier, while Blackie stood beside him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gu Le, if you are smart, then hurry up and f*ck off. When my Zichen-ge comes back, you’re screwed,” Zhuge Kongming roared angrily at the man wearing a faint smug look, who was standing outside the barrier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that so? I don’t know whether or not I’ll be screwed, but I know for certain that you’re going to be screwed now,” Gu Le shook his head with a smile. He waved his hand, then the two attendants beside him stepped forward.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Early stage Spiritual Body.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I wonder how long Young Master Zhuge’s barrier can hold up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, his two attendants charged towards the barrier and attacked maniacally.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhuge Kongming’s expression instantly darkened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They, the Zhuge Family’s relationship with the Gu family had been extremely tense due to the fighting over spiritual veins.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These two families would often send someone to assassinate the elites of the other family. From Gu Le’s expression, Gu Le was certain of killing him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Especially since his barrier would not hold up for long against two early stage Spiritual Body leveled experts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gu Le, you dare to attack me? If my family finds out, they will never be done with your Gu family!” Zhuge Kongming’s face was filled with solemnity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Le suddenly pursed his lips and smiled, “Is our relationship very good? Zhuge Kongming, if you’re going to blame anyone, then blame your bad luck. Recently, several people in our Gu family are competing for the position of the junior family head. It will be a huge achievement for me to take you back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, a crack also appeared on the golden barrier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhuge Kongming’s expression darkened, and bit his lips…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, Young Master Zhuge is actually going to use the forbidden technique, Miracle Gates Escape. That will decrease your lifespan…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Le’s face was filled with a meaningful smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Zhuge Kongming also said coolly, “It’s better that being taken away by a mad dog like you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Zhuge Kongming swiped his right thumb across the corner of his mouth and clapped towards the floor…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Miracle…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment, two muscular men suddenly appeared outside the barrier. Immediately afterwards, the attendants who were furiously attacking the barrier also flew out with a cough of blood without any prior symptoms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Clap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A hand suddenly patted Gu Le’s shoulder. At the same time, a cold warning sounded out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brat, did you not know that, this place… has me watching over it!?”</span></p>
