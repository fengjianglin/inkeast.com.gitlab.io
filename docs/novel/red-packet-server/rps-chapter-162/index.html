 <p><span style>Chapter 162 – The Transformer Spoke</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person who called Ye Zichen was Kang Peng. That guy would always make a call in these sort of important situations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen frowned, then leaned back on the sofa and said helplessly, “What is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye… Ye-zi…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen could hear Kang Peng’s trembling tone through the phone. Ever since the kidnapping incident by Fu Chengming, Ye Zichen became extremely sensitive to that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened?” Ye Zichen asked seriously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Kang Peng stood at the entrance of the dormitory alongside Zhu Yunbai, Baiyu and co. They were currently all huddled together as they stared at the Transformer on Ye Zichen’s bed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Transformer spoke!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen hurried over to the school dormitory, and the moment he entered the room, he saw Kang Peng and co. standing in the corner of the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mortal, you actually dared to touch me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You guys are seeking death. I need you to apologize to me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Speak! Do you think you can avoid this by remaining silent!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>An angry roar rang in Ye Zichen’s ears. He looked over to the sound of the voice and saw Di Tian, who had been turned into a Transformer by the Great Sage pointing and shouting in the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi, just look at your Transformer. What the hell!” Kang Peng gulped. “Ol’ Six just saw that you had a Transformer on your bed and touched it a few times, who knew that it…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen forced himself to walk over under everyone’s gazes. The moment Di Tian saw him, the former shook his robotic fist and jumped up to punch him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye your ass!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen kicked Di Tian into the corner of the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, you actually dare to hit me…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Calm the f*ck down.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen kicked him once again, then picked him up and started to run outside, while covering his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can’t tell anyone about this, understood?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood,” Kang Peng and co. subconsciously nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen licked his lips, then punched the Transformer’s stomach, causing it to scream. Only then, did Ye Zichen run out of the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Ye Zichen left with the Transformer, everyone in the dorm cursed together, “F*ck, did laozi not wake up properly yet? That Transformer actually spoke!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within Ye Zichen’s home.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Fatty Jin squatted on the floor and looked at Di Tian, who was standing on the floor with a tsundere-look, just like a curious baby.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So amazing, even Esteemed Master might not be able to do this much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-Zichen…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*cking shut up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen directly sent the Transformer flying with a kick. Di Tian, who hit the wall, slowly stood up from the ground. Then, not long later, a series of familiar curses sounded out in the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Control him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright,” Third Fatty Jin raised up his hand and covered the Transformer’s mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Ye Zichen looked at the Great Sage, who was on the side, “Great Sage, what’s going on?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Great Sage put down the Wahaha that was in his hand onto the tea table and shrugged, “Isn’t this very normal? I, Old Sun, did not beat him to death, his soul is still intact. It could be said that he’s still a living person, just in a different way. However, he still possesses the ability to think and speak.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then how can I make him calm down?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The Transformer speaking could definitely be called a paranormal event in the Modern World.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>With his relationship with his roommates, the news would not spread out, but letting Di Tian continuously yell like that was still going to be an issue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There isn’t a way, how about you have a chat with him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Great Sage shrugged helplessly, causing Ye Zichen to roll his eyes when he saw the Great Sage’s irresponsible appearance.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>There was no helping it, since the Great Sage wasn’t going to help, he could only negotiate with Di Tian.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Let go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Fatty Jin immediately let go of Di Tian. The moment he did so, Di Tian yelled out that he was going to beat up Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen slapped Di Tian’s head, then squatted in front of Di Tian and raised his eyebrows, “Who are you able to beat up when you’re like this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, what kind of demonic magic did you use on this young master. Hurry up and change this young master back. This young master can allow you to not die.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen slapped Di Tian onto the floor and raised his eyebrows, “Are you actually dumb, or are you just pretending to be? Didn’t you look at yourself? You’re still trying to bargain with me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have you heard of this ancient saying from Huaxia? When a person is under someone else’s roof, they can’t help but bow. If you are going to continue like this, then I can only take off your limbs.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment he said that, Ye Zichen reached out to take off the Transformer’s arms and legs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Di Tian raised his hand up to stop Ye Zichen, while Ye Zichen also looked at him with a look of “continue speaking”.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I feel like we can strike a deal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What deal?” Ye Zichen asked with interest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Turn me back and release me. I won’t cause you trouble after I return to my family.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What awaited Di Tian was yet another slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you think laozi is an idiot? Isn’t letting you return the same as letting a tiger back into the mountains?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandson, this young master is giving you a chance. If you don’t release me, then my older brother and father won’t let you off,” Di Tian lifted his head and swore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Fatty Jin, who was on the side, frowned, “Boss, this is the grandson from the Di family?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who the f*ck are you calling grandson!? Grandson!” Di Tian jumped up and punched him, but Third Fatty just pushed him onto the ground with his palm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandson, Lord Fatty is the third disciple, Jin Zhu, under Great Emperor Qingming! The daoist name is Third Fatty! You f*cking dare to curse Lord Fatty, do you believe that Lord Fatty will just eliminate your entire family!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Di Tian was shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As someone from a Rogue Immortal family, he naturally has heard of Great Emperor Qingming’s name.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>However, why did Great Emperor Qingming’s disciple come to the Modern World?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m telling you, you better stay proper. My Esteemed Master has already contacted your family. I think they shouldn’t offend my Esteemed Master for you. So don’t think of your older brother or dad coming to save you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk, who are you trying to scare?” disdain flashed across Di Tian’s eyes. “You think you’re Great Emperor Qingming’s successor just because you said you are?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t believe me?” Third Fatty Jin snorted coldly, then revealed his right arm. “Look at it yourself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>An azure eight trigrams mark was on his arm, while two azure dragons seemed to spiral at the center.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was a mark only Great Emperor Qingming’s direct disciples.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just kill me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both Ye Zichen and Third Fatty Jing was shocked by Di Tian’s surprise. They had thought that after Third Fatty Jin revealed the direct disciple mark Great Emperor Qingming, this grandson would prostrate and lick…</span></p>
 <p><span style>They didn’t think that he actually had a backbone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen definitely couldn’t kill him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason Ye Zichen kept him was because he would have a use in the future.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s understanding of the hidden families was essentially nil.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Di Tian might be able to become an opening…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have a backbone,” Ye Zichen pursed his lips and smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, Di Tian snorted in disdain, “Just finish laozi off swiftly…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won’t kill you, how about we strike a deal?”</span></p>
