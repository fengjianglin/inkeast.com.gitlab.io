 <p><span style>Chapter 151 – Collapsed World</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing was the one that found out Ye Zichen’s secret the earliest. Although she was surprised about the Great Sage’s appearance, she wasn’t too shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment they walked out of the hotel lobby, Ye Zichen saw a familiar Jeep stop in front of the door. The man beside the Jeep was Su Yan’s father, Su Qihu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Father-in-law, you came to get me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen walked with me a smile and raised eyebrows, causing Su Qihu’s expression to darken. Yet, what surprised Ye Zichen was the fact that Su Qihu did not deny it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The old man told me to come and get you. Get in the car.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh wow, the old man wants to see me. Did he finish his wine?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop bullshitting. Hurry up and get in.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen glanced at Su Qihu speechlessly, </span><i><span style>why is my father-in-law so cold all the time?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It was like he could scold people any time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shrugged, then opened the car door, bent down, and got into the car.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Neither of them spoke during the journey.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nearly fell asleep by the time they arrived at the Su family.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Get out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Qihu opened the car door. Ye Zichen gulped, then slowly got out of the car.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not a criminal, can’t you speak nicer?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Say that again!?” Su Qihu glared at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes, “Fine, you’re amazing. I’m not going to mind. When you’re old, don’t blame me for not supporting you or sending you off.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little bastard, see if I beat you to death.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Man Su, help… Your son wants to beat me to death!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen ran into the courtyard as he shouted, while Su Qihu chased after him with a belt in his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Man Su, quick, manage your son,” said Ye Zichen with a heavy pant as he pointed to Si Quhu, who was behind him, when he finally ran beside Old Man Su’s stone table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qihu,” Old Man Su slammed down on the table, causing Su Qihu, who was really angry just now, to immediately calm down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dad, this little bastard…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What little bastard? I think you’re asking for a beating.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sat opposite Old Man Su and kept indicating towards Su Qihu with his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Su Qihu could not get angry at Old Man Su, he only snorted helplessly and coldly before leaving.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Father-in-law, take care!” Ye Zichen waved and called out loudly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Qihu suddenly stopped for a moment, but he still left without turning his head back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but find it funny when he thought of the look Su Qihu had when he was troubled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Man Su, you’re nice enough. Here’s some monkey wine for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen withdrew a gourd of monkey wine from his WeChat. That was his last gourd, but he didn’t feel pained about it at all. With Monkey Bro here, getting monkey wine wasn’t an issue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Su’s eyes brightened when he saw the gourd.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Ye, not bad. You know how to respect your elders.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two chatted happily for a while, before Ye Zichen suddenly retracting his smile, and tapped onto the stone table with his fingers, “Old Man Su, you have some business with me, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Man Su nodded with a smile, “You got into contact with someone from the Di family.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My granddaughter isn’t hurt, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How could I let hurt get hurt when I’m here,” Ye Zichen shook his head with a smile. “But since you know she got into danger, then why didn’t you go and save her?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s not that I didn’t want to, it’s that I couldn’t save her,” Old Man Su’s revealed a sad expression. “The Di family is one of those half hidden families, they have an extremely high position in the capital. They are a monster even in the capital, so we don’t dare to just easily move against them. Since both of you are from that place, you should have some understanding of the Di family, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen struggled in his heart. Old Man Su clearly treated him as someone from a certain place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he was…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Especially since he has started to come into contact with people from that place, if this continues, then he would be found out.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What Spiritual Body…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What Earth Immortal…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t have any idea of what those were at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Elder Su saw Ye Zichen’s change in expression, he thought that he said something that he shouldn’t have, and quickly apologized, “Lil’ Ye, Grandpa Su doesn’t know about the rules at your place, if I’ve said too much, then don’t take offense.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye ZIchen looked up at Old Man Su…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Man Su should be one of those people that he can trust.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clenched his teeth, then loud out a sigh, “Old Man Su, actually I… Actually I’m not from that place like you think. I’m just a normal person.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Man Su froze upon hearing that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had always treated as Ye Zichen as someone from that place since the beginning, since Ye Zichen’s miracles could only be explained by him being someone from that place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, when he saw Ye Zichen’s slightly struggling expression, he was certain that…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen didn’t lie to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll tell you the truth, actually, I was still a normal university student a month ago. The reason I had such change was actually…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen made the determination to explain everything in one go, but when he reached the main point, a roar suddenly sounded out in his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If thou darest to speak too much, die…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A large area of clear sky suddenly became covered in black clouds. Terrifying lightning sparkled within the clouds, while thunder continuously sounded out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gulp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen forcefully swallowed his words, and roared angrily in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>“This lonely one <a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>. This lonely one knows that thou has thousands of questions, after a while, someone will search for thee in place of this lonely one in order to help thou answer them. During so, if thou dare to say too much, then thou shalt be killed! Remember, remember…”</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>Then the black clouds were dispelled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That Great Emperor Qingming’s words continued to echo in Ye Zichen’s mind.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Who was he!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why did his words appear in my own mind?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Am I able to get into contact with people from the Heavenly Court and Underworld due to the organization of that person?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Ye, Lil’ Ye…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen opened his eyes and looked up to see Old Man Su sitting beside his bed with a worried look…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What exactly happened?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I was clearly chatting with Old Man Su at the stone table, and then I &nbsp;saw the sky…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just what was going on!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Ye, you finally woke up. This pile of old bones can’t bear such shock.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pushed himself up from the bed and looked out the window, only to see that the sky had already darkened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why was I lying here…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re still saying that,” Old Man Su revealed a worrying expression. “We were outside just now. Then you suddenly revealed an expression of determination and said something like ‘actually I…’ However, you just fainted without finishing your sentence. Look how much you scared me…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He clearly remembered revealing everything to Old Man Su, why did this happen…</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, Ye Zichen thought of that Great Emperor Qingming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His eyes suddenly revealed a hint of fright and anxiety.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just what was all this.</span></i><span style> For some reason, Ye Zichen suddenly felt like the world that he knew collapsed!</span></p>
