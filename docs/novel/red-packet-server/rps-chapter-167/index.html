 <p><span style>Chapter 167 – Lü Dongbin’s Immortal Heart of Pure Yang</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He sent it directly.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was stunned when he saw the red packet. Han Xiangzi truly trusted him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s just that, what is that exact treasure is he using to exchange for the ring?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clicked on the red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received Han Xiangzi’s red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Secret Scripture of the Immortal Heart of Pure Yang x1</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time within the Eight Immortals Manor…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Xiangzi peeked over at Lü Dongbin, who was practicing his sword skills on the side, and walked to the corner of the manor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great deity, this is the secret scripture for my Esteemed Master’s Immortal Heart of Pure Yang.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Damn.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Great Deity Lü’s secret scripture.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clicked on the Treasure Chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Secret Scripture of Immortal Heart of Pure Yang: A immortal technique created by Lü Dongbin. It can increase one’s cultivation level without cultivating after learning it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Trial version for False Spiritual level to Complete Stage of the Sky Immortal level.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>A necessary item for lazy people!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s eyes brightened when he saw the description. He had been worried about having no secret scripture for his cultivation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It’s great now, he directly got an entire volume of Lü Dongbin’s Immortal Heart of Pure Yang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It would be able to help him avoid the boring cultivation as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen did openly search for the item within the Treasure Shop with the mindset of “a businessman cannot take a loss”.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen became completely stunned when he saw the price of Immortal Heart of Pure Yang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Secret Scripture of Immortal Heart of Pure Yang. Required cultivation experience: 5,000,000.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Level one was five million, it was even more expensive than the Great Sage’s Fiery Eyes of Truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>More importantly, the one Han Xiangzi sent him didn’t seem to have the level written on it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is this the complete volume?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, level one to nine are all on there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Xiangzi replied carefully. If Lü Dongbin finds out, he would really be beaten to death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was completely shocked.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He earned so much!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>If it wasn’t because it would affect customers in the shop, Ye Zichen really wanted jump out and cheer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Han Xiangzi, who was in the Heavenly Court, got anxious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Celestial sovereign, can this scripture exchange for…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If this secret scripture couldn’t exchange for the ring, then nothing could.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Li Shuang, pack this ring up for me. I’m taking it away.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay, boss.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen put the ring into his pocket, while the face of Xia Keke, which was displaying an unhappy expression until now, brightened up again.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Was it going to give it to me?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>He is giving it to me, right!?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But I don’t really like that ring. It is better than nothing though!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke’s heart beat rapidly once again as she left the jewelry shop with Ye Zichen, while her eyes shone with anticipation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Riche Bro, that ring…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke finally couldn’t resist asking after walking for quite a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen paused a moment after hearing that, then looked at her face full of anticipation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re talking about this ring?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm, what are you going to do with it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke’s heart beat rapidly, while waiting for Ye Zichen to put it onto her finger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s for Han Xiangzi.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen took out his phone and scanned it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He sent it over to Han Xiangzi.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ah!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke’s face became pale, as she looked at the disappearance of the ring from Ye Zichen’s palm at a loss.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It wasn’t a ring for me.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It wasn’t a ring for me.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It wasn’t a ring for me.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke muttered in her heart, while her anticipation became infinite disappointment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She also begun to smile wryly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha, I thought too much into it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke thought to herself. However, at that very moment, a shiny, shimmering ring appeared in front of her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She looked up and saw Ye Zichen’s smiling face, as well as the ring in his hand…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This ring was the exact one that she liked.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Little girl, do you think I can’t tell what you’re thinking?” Ye Zichen patted her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This caused Xia Keke to suddenly weep tears of joy, “Bad guy, you only know how to bully me…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke relentlessly hammered Ye Zichen’s chest, while she bit her lips…</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was truly disappointed just now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop crying,” Ye Zichen used his finger to wipe away the tear from the corner of Xia Keke’s eye, then lifted her snow white hands and put the ring on her finger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It suits you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I… You… Ha… Aiya…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke looked at the ring on her finger, while being unable to say anything due to her excitement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, she could only leap into Ye Zichen’s arms and cry…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your affability level with Xia Keke increased by 50. Current affability level: 320.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your affability level with…</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your affability level with Xia Keke increased by 50. Current affability level: 520.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Affability level levelled up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Current relationship: Lovers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Playboy demon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing commented in midair with a face full of disdain, but more of what she felt was comfort.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen lifted his hand and patted her on the head. She bit her lips with a snort, then floated to the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Xia Keke also left his arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do-Do I look bad?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Traces of tear remained at the corner of her eyes. Ye Zichen reached out with a tissue to wipe away the tears as he shook his head, “No, you’ve always been beautiful.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmph… I-I know I’m beautiful,” Xia Keke sobbed as she lifted her delicate face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She lifted up her hand to the sunlight and looked at the shininess of the ring. Then, she bit her lips and tiptoed in order to kiss Ye Zichen on his lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s to reward you,” Xia Keke lowered her head with a blush.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen chuckled, then grabbed her hand, “This ring is very expensive. Is it over with just a kiss?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what else do you want?” Xia Keke pouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at her face and pursed his lips with a smile, “Once is not enough!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen held her by her waist, and directly kissed her while disregarding the audience.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a long time, when both of them started to suffocate…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen finally left Xia Keke’s lips. Her entire face blushed like an apple, and didn’t dare to look up at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damn pervert!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing stood on the side with her hands on her waist. She had seen the entirety of the heated scene between Ye Zichen and Xia Keke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes at her speechlessly.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This chick was truly weird.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Even though she called him a pervert, she would always stare during moments like this.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It was the same with Xiao Yumei back then, and now the same with Xia Keke.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Buzz.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s phone rang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He took out his phone and looked at the caller ID.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s Su Yan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you dare to tell Susu, I’ll beat you to death!” Xia Keke raised her fist out of the embrassment in her heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won’t, I won’t,” Ye Zichen rubbed her head, then placed the phone beside his ear. “I’m with Keke, how’s it going with you choosing presents over there? Do you need us to come over to pick one out for you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I do want to see who dares to buy antiques at this store.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you keep on causing trouble here, I’m going to call the police.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A series of curses sounded out in the phone, followed by an argument.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows as he listened to the conversation, “Su Yan, what happened on your side?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The call went through!” A mutter sounded out from Su Yan’s side. Not long later, he finally heard her shout.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, hurry over to the Antique Street. Qianqian-jie is in trouble.”</span></p>
