 <p><span style>Chapter 331 – Fight</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dominating aura from the man shot out, scattering the ice and snow that Lu Lu had created.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The eyes of everyone in the room twitched.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Ye Zichen squinted his eyes at Lu Lu and frowned, “Take good care of them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what about you!?” Lu Lu’s expression drastically changed. In her mind, only Ye Zichen was worthy of her care. She did not particularly care about the others at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even though he is coming off strong, he’s just an Earth Immortal. He can’t do anything to me,” with that, Ye Zichen looked up at the man emotionlessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His dark irises lit up with a gold light, while a brownish-grey aura also surfaced on his skin.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Fiery Eyes of Truth, activate!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Unbreakable Body, activate!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“My good son, do you want to fight dad?” the man curled his lips, and chucked the folded fan up into the air…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment the fan fell onto the ground, both Ye Zichen and the man moved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two fists collided together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A huge torrent of spiritual energy spread out with Ye Zichen and the man at the center.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Tian and co., who stood at the back, were so impacted by the wave of spiritual energy that they could not open their eyes. If it wasn’t for Lu Lu setting up a barrier in front of them, they might have been sent flying due to it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Hua Lihua was not so lucky, because she was merely a normal mortal woman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Lu Lu activated the ice world, Hua Lihua could no longer endure it. Then, when the spiritual energy wave appeared, she was directly sent flying, before she hit the wall, causing her to cough up a large mouthful of blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is-Is this really Brother Ye?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shock filled Gu Tian’s eyes, and even Lu Lu was surprised.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had never seen Ye Zichen go out at full force. However, she could tell from he was of the False Earth Immortal level from the faint vibrations of spiritual energy around his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, during that exchange…</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was clear that his strength was not just limited to that level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My good son, I didn’t expect you to not be particularly weak. Not bad, at least you did not inherit the weakness of Gu Rong in terms of strength,” the man smiled sinisterly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stared at him, “You really bullshit far too much. I feel like I’m going to get calluses on my ears just from listening to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe…” the man smiled coldly, then suddenly poured more force into his arm…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who had managed to match the man’s strength so far, was instantly sent flying into a wall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you really think that you are equal to daddy?” the man said angrily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen!” Lu Lu shouted out worriedly. At that moment, Ye Zichen crawled up from the ground with blood flowing down the corner of his mouth. He wiped away the blood, then looked up with eyes filled with endless hatred…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This man in front of me is my father…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What a joke!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen roared, then shot out towards the man once again like a ray of light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang bang bang bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen and the man exchanged blows so quickly that a normal person’s naked eye could no longer capture their movements. The only way they could even identify the exchanges were the sounds of collision that echoed in the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen flew out and hit the wall continuously, but he struggled and stood up every single time, before charging towards that man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had already forgotten about pain. He only had one thought in mind…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Defeat that man, and take revenge for my mother.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Normally, Ye Zichen did have a sort of happy-go-lucky attitude, so he would have at least a slight bit of mercy for everyone. However, when someone truly tramples on his bottom line, even if he knows that he cannot defeat the other person, and clearly knows that he cannot win…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He will still try!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is this a joke!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shouted out with his hoarse voice. At this moment, his irises also turned blood red as he manically charged at the man over and over again due to his grudge!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nobody noticed that while Ye Zichen fought with the man, his hair gradually turned blood red, while his skin turned bronze…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was sent flying to the wall by the man once again. When that happened, blood already begun to uncontrollably gush out from his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He no longer had the strength to stand up. He could only lay on the ground, look in front of him with lost eyes, while struggling to lift his right hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My good son, in the end, you’re still too weak.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man squinted his eyes and walked over with a playful smile. The hair of Lu Lu, who had been protecting Gu Tian’s group, instantly turned the color of ice…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re seeking death,” the man roared. A black ball of energy suddenly appeared in his right hand, which he threw at Lu Lu’s chest without the slightest hint of hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immediately after that, Lu Lu’s body turned feeble, while her hair reverted to its original color.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Body Double, just stay to the side and watch. Do you think that a mere Body Double can be any kind of a threat towards me?” the man laughed recklessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, he ignored Lu Lu, who tried her best with that body of hers, and walked straight in front of Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He put his a hand in his pocket, then reached out his hand towards the fan on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fan instantly appeared in his hand. He fluttered the fan lightly, then smiled with a condescending attitude, “My good son. You’re still too young to try and beat your father!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, a hint of mercilessness flashed in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your existence itself was a mistake. Since it’s like this, then just disappear!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He kicked towards Ye Zichen’s chest with his right leg without any sign of hesitation. At that very moment…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The door was suddenly knocked open. A meatball-like fatty ran in threw the door and crashed into the man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ouch, f*ck. Why is the threshold so high? It nearly tripped Lord Fatty to death. Hey, wait a moment, why is the ground so soft?” Fatty Yin subconsciously turned around and saw the man beneath him. He quickly scratched his head and smiled coyly. “Sorry, sorry. I didn’t notice you there. Sorry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He quickly got up from the man. Then he saw the white-out state of the room, and Ye Zichen and co. who were on the floor…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on? The houses in Linhe Garden can make artificial snow now? You guys were having a snow fight to the point of coughing up blood?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He quickly ran to Ye Zichen’s side, grabbed Ye Zichen’s arm with his hand, then begun to pass along celestial spiritual energy into his body…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, to the fatty’s surprise, he was unable to pass along any celestial spiritual energy into Ye Zichen’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How’s it possible.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How’s it possible?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How’s it possible!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen muttered, wailed, then screamed. Then, when he looked up…</span></p>
 <p><span style>His hair completely turned the color of blood, just like his eyes, while his skin also turned a dark bronze…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahhh…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A pair of pitch black wings spread out from behind his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone in the room freaked out when they saw this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, Fatty Yin muttered to himself frantically, “Fa-Fallen!”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Original Chapter Teaser:</b>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p><b>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</b>Yep, sure. The duty you haven't done for the past... 20 years or so? I'm sure you'll suddenly be a great dad. From the looks of it, all you're going to do is beat the crap out of me. C'mon dude, this isn't the 70s, beating your kid isn't in fashion now. Despite all the stereotypes westerns tend to have of us, beating kids here is not the norm, spoiling the kids is. Also, I could totally sure you for child abuse if you do anything to me...</p>
 <p><strong>Lu Lu:&nbsp;</strong>Ahem... Your age...</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Shit, I'm not a kid anymore, am I... F*ck. Alright, let's be more serious. You abandoned us, both my mother and I. You hurt her beyond all manners of belief. I really don't give a shit if the Gu family did the same, since at this very moment, you're the one who's here.&nbsp;<em>(gets sent flying by a punch)</em></p>
 <p><strong>Fatty Yin:&nbsp;</strong>(mutters) I don't think he realizes how seriously this is yet. Also, just what is this suppressing aura...</p>
 <p><strong>Papa Ye(?):&nbsp;</strong>Enough talking brat. And stop looking at me like this. This is what I hated about Gu Rong, and you inherited it perfectly.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>(crawls up from the ground) Lu Lu, take good care of them.</p>
 <p><strong>Lu Lu:&nbsp;</strong>But you...</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen: </strong>Will be fine. I can't let you help me here, this... Is family business. I'm going to pay him back for everything he has done to mom, and did not do for us.</p>
