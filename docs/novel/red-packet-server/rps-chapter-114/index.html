 <p><span style>Chapter 114 – The collaborating sisters</span></p>
 <p><span style>Time ticked past.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sat in the living room, while a green gourd was sitting in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn’t you want to ask me for medicine for your family’s old man? I’ve never seen your family’s old man, so just take gourd of wine back for him to drink.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dongfang Wenyi picked up the gourd and pulled out the cork, causing the wine fragrant to cover the entire living room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dongfang Wenyi raised his eyebrows, then quickly closed the opening, “What does Young Master Ye want from me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you not suspect whether the thing I gave you is of any use?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fact that Dongfang Wenyi directly spoke conditions without actually saying anything truly surprised Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I hate people that threaten me the most. Perhaps this wine can hurt your family’s old man.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dongfang Wenyi’s eyes instantly turned as cold as a poisonous snake’s. He pursed his lips and put the gourd back onto the table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Ye is smart, and wouldn’t do that. What’s more, we have lots of chances to cooperate in the future.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This guy really isn’t easy to deal with.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s shoudlers trembled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He calmed himself down, then took out a cigarette and lit it, before saying softly, “I want news about Hao Wen and Bai Dahai. Do they have some sort of relationship between them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Smart!” Dongfang Wenyi snapped his fingers, then smiled. “Bai Dahai is under Hao Wen’s control right now. It could be said that he is Hao Wen’s lackey. As for this Hao Wen, he has someone above him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who is above him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know either!” Dongfang Wenyi shrugged. “We, the Dongfang family are the same as the Xiao family, we are all businessmen, so we can’t investigate into some hidden matters. The hint I can provide you with is that Hao Wen’s subordinates are controlling Bai Dahai’s wife and daughter. They are planning something that will cause you to trip over.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Only trip?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen already predicted that Bai Dahai and Hao Wen were in cohorts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They must be planning some sort of shocking action.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he never could have thought that Dongfang Wenyi actually said that it was only to trip him up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tripping Young Master Ye up is already really amazing. Could they cause Young Master Ye to fall completely with your identity?” Dongfang Wenyi’s eyes revealed infinite meanings behind it when he said this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as if he knew about Ye Zichen’s background, and his tone was also faintly certain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This wasn’t the first time Ye Zichen has met this sort of situation, they clearly treated him as a certain sort of people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those people were very mysterious, and had countless abilities just like him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>But, who exactly were those people?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Would he come into contact with those people in the future?</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, since Dongfang Wenyi misunderstood, then just let him continue misunderstanding. There was nothing bad for Ye Zichen here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s enough for Young Master Dongfang to know, but people from our place don’t like others speaking too much. Young Master Dongfang should know what to do, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Ye Zichen said this, Dongfang Wenyi’s calm demeanor completely changed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t think that Ye Zichen was truly someone from that place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But what did someone from there come over to do? Aren’t there regulations about how the people from that place not being able to casually enter the modern world?</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter what, he couldn’t offend this person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is natural,” Dongfang Wenyi seemed a lot weaker. Although his Dongfang family was reputed in the business realm, and was even able to make a stand in the capital.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were nothing compared with the people from that place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Say it, what exactly is Hao Wen and Bai Dahai plotting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen refused Dongfang Wenyi’s offer for transport when he left the Fu family, and walked out by himself to get a taxi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wenyi, that brat…” Fu Hong, who stood in the living room, tried to speak, but Dongfang Wenyi quickly stopped him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Uncle, you better not speak carelessly. Even us, the Dongfang family cannot offend him due to his identity. Put it in a bad way, if Young Master Ye wanted to, he can easily destroy your business.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?” Dongfang Yun also hurried over when she heard that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dongfang Wenyi nodded in without denying anything, “He’s from that place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dongfang Yun’s expression instantly changed when Dongfang Wenyi finished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When another boring theory lesson finished, Ye Zichen, who was unenergetically sitting in his seat, instantly became filled with energy as if he just drank a bottle of Mizone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked up, and coincidentally saw Sun Yige, who just stood up from her seat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sun…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wanted to greet the class rep, but she hurriedly ran from the classroom when she saw him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen didn’t know why, but the class rep seemed to be intentionally avoiding him recently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This confused him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t seem to have done anything to the class rep, why was she always avoiding him?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Riche Bro!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two calls sounded out from outside the door while Ye Zichen was in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He turned around and saw Su Yan and Xia Keke wave towards him beside each other. Ye Zichen immediately walked towards the two of them under the jealous gazes of his male classmates.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did you two come together?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was slightly hesitatant, these two girls knew that the other person liked him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The atmosphere between the three of them became strange when they came to him together like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can’t we come together?” A secretive look flashed across Su Yan’s beautiful eyes. She, who had already gotten past it, no longer cared about whether Xia Keke liked Ye Zichen or not.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But she liked to see him get troubled, and mostly, it’s so that he would remember.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not to always get involved with girls outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke also pouted and snorted, “This lady came with Susu to come find you and you’re unwilling?</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>For some reason, Ye Zichen felt like these two girls came prepared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since he couldn’t deal with them, then couldn’t he just avoid them?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then… Two young mistresses, what have you come to find this puny one for? If there isn’t anything important, then allow this puny one to leave first?” With that, Ye Zichen turned around to run.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan reached out to grab his shirt, and smiled playfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you leaving in such a hurry? Where are you going?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe,” Ye Zichen turned around and rubbed his hand with a dry smile when he saw that he didn’t manage to run.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn’t I start a supermarket earlier? You also now that it’s a place Su Yiyun found for me. Say, I’m in the middle of creating my business, so wouldn’t I have to often go back to keep watch?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that so?” Su Yan had a playful expression and looked meaningfully at Ye Zichen. “Really?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, then hurry to your supermarket,” Su Yan released Ye Zichen’s collar with a smile and wrapped her arms around Xia Keke’s, “Keke, let’s go, don’t disturb him starting his business.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Riche Bro has started a business!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, didn’t he say that he has to start a business!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I feel like he’s lying to us. Susu, what do you think!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think so too, but I don’t dare to say it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two girls changed from agreeing with each other to collaborating, causing Ye Zichen to completely get annoyed. He put his hands on his waist and said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What exactly do you two want? Just say it directly!”</span></p>
