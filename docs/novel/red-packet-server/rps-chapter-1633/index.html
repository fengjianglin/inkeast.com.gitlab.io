 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In practically a single breath of time, Yang Jian and the Great Sage took up positions at Ye Zichen’s side.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Their divine power surged within them. Although neither of them unleashed it, this room was small and cramped enough that everyone sensed a heavy, intimidating aura.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Quite a few of the experts who’d rushed over here watched with rapt attention, as if comparing the two sides.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Isn’t that Demon Emperor Kui Lin? What’s he doing here?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“What kind of stupid question is that? Who isn’t interested in transcendence?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Who’s brave enough to face down the Demon Emperor? Is it the God Emperor?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The others watched from the sidelines. Those speaking were almost all imperial kings, those who’d yet to become imperial lords and were mostly here to test their luck.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In their eyes, the three Realm Emperors were peerless, untouchable existences.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Only others at their level would dare stand their ground against them.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“It doesn’t look like it’s the God Emperor. If I’m not mistaken, that man they’re huddling protectively around should be Ye Zichen. His name’s been spreading like wildfire over the past few years, and it seems the God Realm’s Tenth Divine Mountain is his territory.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Those with keen eyes recognized Ye Zichen. Those not in the knew didn’t, but when they heard the name “the Tenth Divine Mountain” their eyes lit up with enlightenment.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Nine Divine Mountains of the God Realm had existed as long as the realm itself, and in billions of years, nothing had changed.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The appearance of a tenth Divine Mountain didn’t just shock the gods; it was an enormous surprise to the yao and demons as well.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>They didn’t know the nature of Ye Zichen and the Demon Emperor’s relationship at first, but now they understood: the recently famous Alliance Head Ye and the Demon Emperor seemed to have quite a grudge between them.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Otherwise, they wouldn’t have reacted with such hostility the second they bumped into each other.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The imperial kings, with their relatively low cultivations, all fell silent for fear that a battle between imperial lords would implicate them. Those long reclusive seniors, meanwhile, merely glanced over indifferently, then looked away. They’d already seen more than enough of this sort of thing in their long lives. All they wanted was to find a way of breaking through their shackles within the Transcendent Mausoleum.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“It seems he’s the one we’ve been looking for.” Not far away, a loli-type girl grinned. Her rosy cheeks and little face displayed an expression that seemed uncharacteristically mature for someone who looked so young.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A tall, stalwart man stood beside her. He nodded. “Most likely, yes.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Going forward, keep an eye out for him. But then, it seems the situation’s pretty good. At least he’s got quite a few experts around him, so we won’t have to play nanny.” The girl grinned, her eyes narrowing into splits. Then, she looked away from Ye Zichen and regained her usually, youthful, carefree smile.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When the man accompanying her saw this, he couldn’t help but shudder.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Demon Emperor Kui Lin.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Given his reputation, even if he didn’t cause a fuss, his arrival ought to have at least drawn attention.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yet against all expectations, he appeared behind Ye Zichen silently. It was only after he spoke that others noticed him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Don’t be so nervous.” Kui Lin laughed, shrugged, and took several steps back. “I have no intention of harming Alliance Head Ye. If I did, he’d be nothing but a corpse already.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>That was the truth!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Kui Lin sat upon the Demon Emperor’s throne. It didn’t matter how he’d obtained this position; no one could afford to underestimate his strength. Even though Yang Jian and the Great Sage reacted quickly, compared to someone like Kui Lin, they were far too slow.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>So long as Kui Lin wished it, a moment ago, Ye Zichen would have already collapsed in a pool of blood.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yet Ye Zichen still stood there, alive and intact. That meant that Kui Lin really didn’t plan to attack.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Suddenly, yet another group walked into the hidden room. Their arrival drew the crowd’s attention.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You two really are good dogs, huh?” Su Qingyan glanced at the King of the South, Jiao Hai, and the King of the East, Tai Tan. She snorted. Yao had always been on poor terms with demons. Although things were tense between all three races, the yao had always been a little closer to gods. No matter what else you said, in the primordial era, it was the demons who brazenly tried to seize yao territory. It was only by joining forces with humanity that they fought off the demonic invasion.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Jiao Hai and Tai Tan were kings of their respective kingdoms, yet they’d disregarded ancient enmities between yao and demon to side with Kui Lin.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It was really shameful!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Get off your high horse,” sneered Jiao Hai. “The era is nearing its end, and we have to choose the best tree to perch on. You lead a Sacred Beast Clan, but haven’t you, too, led your people into submission towards another?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Jiao Hai, we’re not here to argue about that.” Demon Emperor Kui Lin stretched out his hand to silence him. Then, his gaze landed on Ye Zichen. He was well aware that within this group, Ye Zichen had the final say.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Zichen was unsure of Kui Lin’s motives, but Ye Zichen was glad to see that he had no intentions of attacking them here. He turned and gently shook his head at the Fox Empress, then glanced pointedly at his friends.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yang Jian and the Great Sage gradually retracted their auras.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Then, Ye Zichen narrowed his eyes and asked, “I’m surprised you were interested in this too, Demon Emperor!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“What are you saying, Alliance Head Ye? Who isn’t interested in transcendence?” Kui Lin laughed heartily. “Aren’t you quite interested too? Otherwise, why would you bring such a large group with you here?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Zichen smiled but didn’t explain. He had no need to explain himself to Kui Lin. Besides, he was more interested in what Kui Lin had said earlier. “Demon Emperor, what did you mean by that?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I just thought you weren’t alert enough. Danger lurks on every side in here. If you go on like this, I’m afraid your head and body will soon bid each other farewell.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You misunderstood me,” said Ye Zichen. “What I’m asking is, what did you mean when you said that Zhou Wu couldn’t enter this place?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This time, Kui Lin really was stunned. He hadn’t thought that Ye Zichen, even now, had no idea what was happening outside.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You still don’t know the situation? The Ocean Emperor and the others are here too, so ask them. I just came here to greet you, but since your people seem on guard against me, and my people seem to dislike interacting with yours, I’ll take my leave.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Kui Lin laughed, then led his group back to where most of those present were gathered. Everyone instinctively cleared a path for him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Zichen watched him leave, then turned toward the Ocean Emperor. “Why can’t Zhou Wu make it?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“It’s rather strange.” Xue Yang explained everything that had happened outside. The more Ye Zichen heard, the more dazed he felt.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Everyone could enter. Only Zhou Wu was forbidden from stepping foot inside!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Zhou Wu has tried his utmost to transcend, but at the end of the day, it just isn’t his fate. How ridiculous.” Great Emperor Bi’an sneered.</p>
 <p>It wasn’t his fate!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>For some reason, Ye Zichen felt as if he’d heard that phrase somewhere before, but he couldn’t for the life of him remember who’d said it.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But if Zhou Wu couldn’t enter, that was a good thing. There were already far too many people he had to keep an eye on here.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>One less competitor meant one less thing to worry about.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Little did he know, at that very moment, just outside the mausoleum…</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Resentment of Ice!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Howling Valley, which had once been a sea of searing flame, had now transformed into a world of ice. Fierce, icy winds mixed with snow howled throughout the surrounding area, while a single blazing figure stood before the mausoleum. He was covered from head to toe in wounds.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Blood dripped from the gashes, but it didn’t get far before freezing into red crystals.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This fiery figure was none other than Zhou Wu. His flames, which at first had seemed capable of burning both heaven and earth to cinders, had now dulled significantly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The domain he’d released was no fragmented, jumbled, and incomplete.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It was clear that the lofty God Emperor Zhou Wu was now at a disadvantage.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Take my staff!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Bitingly-cold frost covered Zhou Wu, slowing his movements. Gou Yuzhuan held his metal staff, which he could grow and shrink at will. Then, eyes glinting viciously, he swung at Zhou Wu’s vitals.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gou Yuzhuan attacked with confidence that Zhou Wu had no were left to run. If this attack didn’t kill him, it would still leave him grievously wounded.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>To his surprise, when the staff actually landed, a barrier appeared around Zhou Wu, blocking the otherwise fatal strike completely.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Reinforcements!” Gou Yuzhuan cautiously examined the surrounding area. The others slowed their attacks too, then spread out their divine senses.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>No one!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Never mind an expert worthy of guarding against, there wasn’t even a single living thing within a million square miles.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Was it you?” Face still dripping with blood, Zhou Wu narrowed his eyes and glanced at the stone statue.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Leave. You cannot enter this place. The valley contains our Four Great Auxiliary Stars’ starlight, and the current Four Great Auxiliary Stars stand in your way. If you try and force your way in, you cannot possibly succeed.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Hah…”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Despite the severity of his wounds, Zhou Wu had never once lowered his proud head.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>His gaze swept across the mausoleum that contained his final hope before landing upon the four figures overhead. The Four Great Auxiliar Stars surged with starlight.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Even though he didn’t want to back down, he knew he had to accept reality.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He couldn’t force his way in no matter how hard he tried!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I admit defeat.” Despite his immense unwillingness, Zhou Wu pursed his lips and hatefully lowered his head. His air was ragged, and his eyes were bloodshot, embellishing his wretched state.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The lofty God Emperor, the leader of the God Realm, had lost!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Dispel your barrier and let me return.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You can leave now, but before you go, let me give you a word of advice,” said the stone statue. “You are not fated to transcend. No matter what methods you attempt, you cannot take that final step. I encourage you to give up. Your era nears its end. Even if you cannot transcend, at your cultivation, you are one of the true elites of the Upper Three Realms. When the end comes, experts of your caliber shall be needed. If you set aside your obsessions, you might very well see the light.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When he heard the stone statue’s earnest, well-meaning advice, Zhou Wu’s expression only contorted even more.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Finally, he nodded firmly, then cupped his fist at the statue. “Thank you for you guidance.”</p>
