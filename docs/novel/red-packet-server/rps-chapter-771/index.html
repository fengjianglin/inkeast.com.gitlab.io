 <p><span style>Chapter 771 – Nine-Tails</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nervousness swarmed the chat group as Hua Tuo immediately responded after getting notified of Yang Jian’s injuries.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hua Tuo: I’ll immediately get over there after handling things at hand here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: He has no time to waste.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hua Tuo: God of Thunder, Great Deity Yang Jian may require healing, but the normal soldiers do too. As a doctor, I treat everybody equally.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King Li (Admin): Hua Tuo, please don’t get angry, that wasn’t what God of Thunder meant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hua Tuo: Since Great Deity Yang Jian was severely injured, it must be due to strong corpse poison. It would be rather difficult for me to deal with it alone. @Old Lord Taishang, I would like to request you to come with me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang: No problem, I’ll descend right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen squinted his eyes as he skimmed over the rolling messages.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the start, he thought that something happened in the Heavenly Court, but now, it looks like they seemed to be battling somewhere else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>More importantly… They mentioned corpse poison…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only Idealism: What are you guys talking about, can someone explain the situation to me?</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the message got no replies. It was the exact opposite of how Ye Zichen’s messages would get millions of replies. There was no doubt about it that the Heavenly Court was now in a very stressful situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even more so than during the demon invasion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s phone rang. He quit the chat and saw that the North Pole Emperor sent him a message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Emperor Ye.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“North Pole Emperor. I could tell from the chat that the Heavenly Court is in some trouble?” Ye Zichen replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It isn’t the Heavenly Court that’s in trouble.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s the Endless beast Region. Around half a month ago, the spiritual beasts in the Endless Beast Region were assaulted seemingly by the jiangshi progenitor. I wanted to discuss about this with you, but I got no replies.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have been in closed cultivation the past two months, but you just said… jiangshi progenitor?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Indeed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The North Pole Emperor had a troublesome look on his face as he sat within the Cloudy Palace of the Golden Arches. It hadn’t been long since he inherited the position from the Jade Emperor and he was already stressing out over this situation. He had gotten no rest the past two weeks and have been dealing with all the news from the frontline.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The progenitor’s ability to turn others into one of them is too powerful. The Endless Beast Region has already suffered various unsalvageable damages. That’s why I had to send out the Heavenly Court’s army, but… it hadn’t been of much help. Many of our soldiers have been infected by corpse poison and some of them have even turned into the progenitor’s spawns.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s heart clenched.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How has the Four Sacred Beast Clans and Heavenly Nine-Tail Fox Clan been?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most of the people Ye Zichen knew well were from the Endless beast Region. He desperately wanted to know how their clan has been.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s bad. The Deer Clan was wiped out and the Ice Empress has been heavily injured.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was completely shocked. He didn’t even notice his phone falling to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Lu Lu is heavily injured.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>The Deer Clan has been wiped out…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He could still remember how Lu Lu appeared like a descending goddess in the Modern Realm and squash the half beastmen, which he was helpless again, dead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After coming to the Immortal Region, he also understood just how fearsome the Ice Empress title was in the Three Realms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is this yours?” Lady Providence suddenly appeared beside Ye Zichen with his phone in her hands. “Is this a transmitter you people use in the Lower Realms? I felt an invisible net that seemed to cover the Three Realms here. Your method of communication is truly spectacular.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lady Providence,” Ye Zichen quickly bowed. “Are you going on a journey again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When people reach my position, we tend to see through everything. Power and money are things that can be put aside. They don’t even compare to the enjoyment of going around to look at the scenery all around,” Lady Providence smiled gently, then returned Ye Zichen’s phone to him. “But I came out this time for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I wonder what about me made it worth your grace coming out to see me again?” Ye Zichen replied with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I asked you two questions earlier, but you only asked me one. Owing things to other people is the one thing I detest, so I took the divined a little for you,” Lady Providence replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Normally speaking, Ye Zichen might patiently ask her what she found out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But the Beast Region was now under assault, his friends and girlfriends were in grave danger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right now, he desperately wanted to get to the frontlines. Even if he could only offer very little, he wanted to face everything with them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Ye Zichen hid that thought very well, Lady Providence could still see his anxiousness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can tell that you’re anxious. Since I have nothing to do right now, I might as well go and take a look with you. What do you think about that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Being able to accompany you if my honor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lady Providence flicked her finger upwards. Ye Zichen felt the place around him change. In the blink of an eye, they were already in the air above the Endless Beast Region.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Such abilities…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen knew very clearly that it would take several hours for him to get to the Endless Beast Region at full speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Lady Providence merely needed to transport them here with a wave of her hands.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just how adept is she at using space warping powers?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Although Ye Zichen was surprised, he was more concerned with the situation of the beast region.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked around and settled his gaze onto a towering tree.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>This is where the Nine-Tail Fox clan is!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You may have all forgotten, but I protect the Nine-Tail Fox Clan!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A burst of prideful laughter sounded out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen instantly identified the speaker as Su Liu’er, the clan head of the Nine-Tail Fox Clan, from her tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The air in the surrounding seemed to freeze and chilling winds slashed against people’s faces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Liu’er wiped away the blood from her mouth with her finger. A silvery mark on her forehead shimmered and nine tails waded in the wind behind her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nine-Tails.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was showing all nine tails.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her pale blue eyes glistened, then she stretched out her nine snow white tails like a peacock spreading its tails…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You deserve death for attacking the Heavenly Nine-Tail Fox Clan!”</span></p>
