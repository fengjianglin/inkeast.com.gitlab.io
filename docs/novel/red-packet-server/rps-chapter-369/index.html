 <p><span style>Chapter 369 – An Amazing Older Sister</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian’s appearance of wanting to speak, but ended up stopping himself caused Ye Zichen to frown. Approximately ten-odd minutes later, another message from Yang Jian appeared on his screen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, accept it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen quickly looked at his friend requests. When he saw all the friend requests, he rolled his eyes speechlessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Send me her account, I’ll add her!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian immediately sent the deity’s account over. Ye Zichen immediately added her and wrote “I am Sky Sovereign Nameless, a friend of Yang Jian.” on his confirmation message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s friend request was accepted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little Brother Yang Jian said that you can make me pretty?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman named Stone Fairy promptly sent a message to Ye Zichen. Ye Zichen immediately turned speechless upon seeing that…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Little brother.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Since she dares to call Yang Jian as her little brother, then she should be pretty amazing in the Heavenly Court!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But who the hell is this Stone Fairy? I’ve read tons of myths and legends about the Heavenly Court and the Underworld, and have read quite a few Baidu-pedia articles on them, but why have I never even heard of her?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Indeed,” Ye Zichen nodded. “But this is a paid service. If I am able to make you pretty, then you have to work for me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I understand,” Stone Fairy typed out her reply with a smile. “Tell me how I should I help you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait till after I make you pretty. Of course, it’s not possible right now. We can set a time instead. How about tomorrow?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had no cosmetics on hand, and he also needed to find some time to search for some makeup videos online.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, he could not do all that by himself, he needed to find a makeup teacher to begin the lesson as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Otherwise, wasn’t it just pointless for a dude like him to teach beauties how to put on makeup!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I always have time. Just call me here when you’re free.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your intimacy level with Stone Fairy increased by 200.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Intimacy level leveled up. Current intimacy level: Trusted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, you finished chatting with her?” the moment Ye Zichen finished talking with Stone Fairy, Yang Jian immediately sent him a message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm, pretty much. This big sis was pretty cooperative. But who is this fairy, why is she called Stone Fairy, and why did she call you little brother?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen asked in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh, about that…” Yang Jian chuckled slightly ashamedly as he typed out his reply. “I lost in arm wrestling to her not long ago. Ever since then, she began to call me little brother.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Arm wrestling? And you actually lost?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was completely stunned. An increase in cultivation level would cause a person’s strength and everything else to increase.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter what, Yang Jian was of the complete stage of the Human Immortal level. Since he lost to her, then doesn’t that make Stone Fairy a Sky Immortal level expert?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then she’ll definitely be famous in the Heavenly Court. </span><i><span style>But why haven’t I heard anyone mention her?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, I lost! She’s just of the early stage of the Human Immortal level, but she was born with divine strength so even if the monkey tried, he wouldn’t be able to beat her in arm wrestling!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian replied slightly helplessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It really is my fault. If I didn’t show off my muscles in front of those fairies, then I wouldn’t have pissed her off.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is karma!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen chatted a bit more with Yang Jian, and only stopped when something seemed to have come up on Yang Jian’s side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled over on the bed. At that moment, he felt a bitter gaze staring at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t even needed to think about who it was. Only Liu Qing was able to appear in his room at that moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen turned around, and as he expected, Liu Qing laid beside him and watched him with her large eyes full of complaint.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You terrible person,” Liu Qing pouted while unhappiness covered her delicate face. “What did you go off to do? I haven’t seen you in so long!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rubbed her head with a smile when he saw her pout, “I was busy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since you were going away for so long, why didn’t you bring me along?” Liu Qing muttered with a pout. “These few days, I’ve been either sleeping in the Dragon Eye, or flying around the room… There was nobody to play with me. Do-Do you not like me anymore!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How could that be? Fine, I was wrong, alright?” Ye Zichen shrugged, then was reminded of the situation of the water soaking Soul Pearl Yiyuan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before he went over to the capital, Soul Pearl Yiyuan seemed to need to soak in the water for ten-odd more days. Since he stayed over in the capital for quite a long time, the water might already be ready.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Since I’ve prepared all the necessary items for her revival, it’s time for me to revive Liu Qing and accomplish my initial goal.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment…</span></p>
 <p><span style>A green pearl shot over, which Ye Zichen noticed was Soul Pearl Yiyuan after it got close to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did you come over?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows at the pearl. Soul Pearl Yiyuan continued to spin around him. &nbsp;Ye Zichen scratched his chin, then his eyes lit up. “It’s been long enough?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soul Pearl Yiyuan instantly nodded in a human like fashion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that a smile bloomed on Ye Zichen’s face. He looked up and rubbed Liu Qing on the head, “You can be revived very soon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen drove over to the apartment and saw that Third Fatty Jin was playing video games with Di Tian. Since Di Tian had identified the sheath of the Xuan-Yuan Sword, Ye Zichen kept his word and no longer forced him to do housework.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Ye, when did you come back? Why didn’t you get little brother to get you?” Third Fatty Jin chucked the controller onto the side and ran over with a flattering smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Di Tian glanced over at Ye Zichen, then called out between clenched teeth, “Boss Ye.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded towards them, and thought about his purpose, then said with a smile, “Keep on playing. I just came here to get something.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen ran straight to the room on the second floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dark night caused his room to be pitch black. In the corner of room, the Holy Water of Yiyuan that Soul Pearl Yiyuan soaked in shimmered with a faint light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen scanned it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The system has detected Holy Water of Yiyuan that Soul Pearl Yiyuan had submerged in for forty-nine days. Would you like to collect it?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Right on time,” Ye Zichen smiled, then clicked “Yes” on the screen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Holy Water of Yiyuan on the ground disappeared. Ye Zichen clicked open the Treasure Chest, and found the ready Holy Water of Yiyuan within.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh? Has all the treasures that is needed for my revival been gathered?” Liu Qing blinked in wonder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded, then knocked on her little head, “Yeah, you can get revived very soon. What do you want to do after being revived?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Me?” Liu Qing giggled, then licked her lips. “Be with you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sincerity in her tone caused Ye Zichen to smile wryly. </span><i><span style>This girl seriously wants to be with me. But if that’s the case, then I’ll get another woman by my side…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen scratched his head, then pushed away the other thoughts in his mind. He nodded towards her with a smile, then opened WeChat and found his chat with King Chujiang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That old brat had said it back then that when Ye Zichen gathered all the items, Ye Zichen just needed to find him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“King Chujiang! Come out quickly!”</span></p>
 <p></p>

 <p></p>
 <p>Man, I really don't get why my bro wants to choose her as the spokesperson. She... I-I really don't think she's suitable at all.</p>
 <p>Isn't he going to start makeup lessons? Then shouldn't he find a kinda cute girl and turn her prettier with makeup?</p>
 <p>Why this Big Sis? Ugh, if I didn't know better, I would have thought of her as a Big Bro instead... Damn, this really brings back my shameful memories. I can't believe it, like I seriously can't.</p>
 <p>But whatever, I guess she's still a woman, and she'll want to turn prettier, so I'll just send her my bro's contact...</p>
