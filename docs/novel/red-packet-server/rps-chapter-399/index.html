 <p><span style>Chapter 399 – Otherworld</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master, Ye Zichen is already going towards the incident location.” Song An’s sinister chuckle sounded out within the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man on the sofa nodded, “Just treat it as a present for him. How strong are the ones inside?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They are all normal people who have been demonified. Their strength is around the spiritual body level, so they won’t pose Ye Zichen any threat at all,” Guo Jing said as she wore a light gown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Song An couldn’t help but gulp when he saw her beautiful figure hidden beneath the piece of clothing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, you like?” the man on the sofa smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Song An instantly shook his head, “No, no!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t be nervous. Work for me properly. As for her… I’ll give her to you,” the man on the sofa directly said so in front of Guo Jing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Jing was momentarily stunned, but she did not dare to voice any objection.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Buzz…</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the phone she placed on the tea table vibrated. When she saw the message on it, she turned around to the man on the sofa.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That guy is calling me, he might want to ask me out on a date.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then go. Your mission is just to accompany him. Slowly infiltrate amongst them, then give Ye Zichen a huge present.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay,” Guo Jing left the living room with a nod, while Song An’s gaze remained fixated on her alluring body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, stop looking. I told you that I will give her to you. But, she’s still my plaything right now. Hurry up and see where Ye Zichen is now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Song An instantly shrunk his neck and shifted his gaze, “He already arrived.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ White, it’s here, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen parked his Panamera on the side of the street. However, he did not notice any abnormality when he got out, nor did he see Xia Keke and co…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Lil’ White called out, Ye Zichen began to walk into the alleyway on the side of the street, but Lil’ White held him back by the edge of his trousers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What now?” Ye Zichen asked in confusion. He could feel just how dangerous it was for Xia Keke and co. from the call just now, so he had to hurry!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not in here like here, but here like there…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ White suddenly said something random.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What kind of crap are you saying?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ White spun on the spot anxiously, since he wasn’t sure how to explain it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Ye Zichen’s phone rang. He took it out and saw a system notification.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received Otherworld Pass x1. The possessor of this pass gains the right to enter the Otherworld.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clicked open his WeChat Treasure chest in confusion. The moment he withdrew the pass, he saw it lit up with a blinding light. When his sight finally recovered, he noticed that he had already in another world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s this place!” Lil’ White jumped up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Ye Zichen nodded, while he turned even more vigilant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked around. </span><i><span style>It’s still the street from before.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, the street was now in shambles, while dense demonic swirled around the space above the streets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Ye Zichen heard a loud noise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That way!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He quickly ran towards the source of the sound, but when he got there…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What exactly is this!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slimes filled the street, while two nearly ten-meter tall humanoids stood behind them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahh…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every single time they breathed, the demonic energy in the surroundings became denser.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Roar!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A huge dragon roar sounded out from the corner of the streets, then not long later, a the mirage of a golden dragon passed through the monsters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the golden dragon mirage disappeared, the Slimes were also reduced to demonic energy before vanishing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However…</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were just too many Slimes. Even though the mirage was very powerful, it was unable to stop their advancement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Keke!” Ye Zichen’s pupils contracted. The ones in the corner of the street was Xia Keke and Su Yan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Break!” Ye Zichen yelled, while his swung his fist towards the monsters with a might that could break through winds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A ball of flame also appeared in Lil’ White’s mouth…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zzzzzst.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A red wave instead appeared in front of him, incinerating a large area filled with Slimes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ White, good job,” Ye Zichen smiled. </span><i><span style>It seems like Lil’ White evolved again.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Yiyuan!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soul Pearl Yiyuan, which had remained in him begun to deploy a water barrier without Ye Zichen’s orders and covered Xia Keke and Su Yan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Water blade….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Several hundred blades made out of water suddenly appeared in the sky. They shimmered with a fear-inducing light, completely scattering all of the Slimes on the streets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen…” Obvious terror filled Xia Keke’s face. When Ye Zichen walked next to them, she immediately leaped on him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan had wanted to as well, but when she saw Xia Keke beside Ye Zichen, she merely smiled wryly, then bit her lips and shuddered on the spot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just what happened? How did you guys end up here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had no time to care about anything else, as he fixed his gaze on the area outside the water barrier, he saw that slimes had filled the streets once again, while the two ten-meter tall figures also slowly advanced towards them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know!” Xia Keke sobbed. She trembled, then clenched her teeth. “We… just came back together after a meal, but when we got here, everything turned like this…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen let out a sigh, then patted their shoulders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ White, who was behind him, suddenly shouted. Ye Zichen turned back and saw that the slimes had already bitten a whole in the water barrier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t let them touch you, those slimes are corrosive!” Su Yan suddenly spoke up. Only then did Ye Zichen notice a red mark on her arm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you alright!?” Ye Zichen quickly grabbed her arm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan shook her head and smiled, “I’m fine. Keke already treated it for me. It shouldn’t leave a scar!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded softly, then turned around and kicked the slime, which had already gotten into the barrier, out. “Keke, protect Su Yan… Seriously, these monsters are endless.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoosh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A ray of golden light suddenly shimmered around Ye Zichen’s body, then a faint mirage of an ancient dragon appeared behind him…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dragon?” Xia Keke raised her eyebrows in surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All of you, die!” Ye Zichen’s fist was covered with a gold light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, at that very moment, the slimes on the street suddenly disappeared, while the two monsters nearly ten-meters tall also collapsed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ta…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ta…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ta…</span></p>
 <p><span style>A purple-haired and black-skinned boy suddenly appeared on the end of the streets. He tilted his head and raised his eyebrows at the places where the monsters disappeared from.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Too weak. I can’t get excited at all!”</span></p>
