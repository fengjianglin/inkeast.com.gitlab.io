 <p><span style>Chapter 108 – The Conference in the Heavenly Court ended</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Deyou’s face instantly darkened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen actually said that he was sick in front of so many people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have been a doctor for so many years, could I be unclear about the condition of my own body? Young man, stop being demagogic here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How am I demagogic? I’m doing this for your good,” Ye Zichen frowned helplessly. “ Of course, you are indeed a doctor. But haven’t you learnt that doctors don’t cure themselves after being a doctor for so many years?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then say what sickness I have,” &nbsp;Wu Deyou’s smile had completely disappeared,Ye Zichen still dared to claim he was sick in front of all these people, it would be strange if he could still be in a good mood after that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, then I’ll go ahead and say it!” Ye Zichen pursed his lips and smiled. Huang Shengmei, who was by the side, wanted to stop him, but when she saw his confident gaze, she immediately stopped herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Recently, have your eyes been swollen when you wake up? When you wash your hair, a large amount of hair falls out? When you drink a normal amount of water, you have to wake up to go to the bathroom more than three times during the night?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Duyou’s expression froze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems like you haven’t realized how severe the problem is yet. It was lucky for you to have met me, otherwise…” Ye Zichen shook his head with a sigh, as if he would have been beyond saving otherwise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No one wouldn’t place an importance on their health and Wu Deyou was no exception. The three points he said earlier were indeed describing his situation, so he couldn’t help but reply seriously, “What sickness is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now you believe that you’re sick, right?” Ye Zichen grinned playfully. “Try and press down on the right side of your stomach.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Deyou pressed down without thinking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nothing happened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A bit more down, and press it hard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>POOOT.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A terrible stench instantly filled the restaurant, causing the customers within to all cover their mouths and noses as they ran out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Deyou’s face also turned green.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You messed with me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who messed with you? As a doctor, you don’t even remember the uses of your acupoints and you’re saying that I messed with you? But I did it for your own good, it was to help you release some foul gas from within…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Puu… Ugh…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brat, I’ve remembered you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Deyou instantly ran away from the restaurant frantically. Meanwhile, Ye Zichen fanned in front of his nose a few times, then saw towards Huang Shengmei, “Let’s go as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your affability level with Huang Shengmei increased by 20. Current affability level: 535.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled when he finally sent Huang Shengmei to the hospital, “I didn’t cause trouble for you, right? I just didn’t like the look of that geezer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No way, I didn’t like the look of him either. If he really causes trouble for me and I can’t deal with it, then I’ll just change hospitals.” Huang Shengmei smiled. Suddenly, she bit her lips with a blush, then moved her head forward, and kissed Ye Zichen’s cheek. “I’ll be going to work now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Ye Zichen sent Huang Shengmei off, Liu Qing floated out and said slowly, “You started picking up girls again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was stunned, then said with a face of speechlessness, “How did I start picking up girls again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You didn’t?” Liu Qing pouted and pointed at him. “You helped Huang Shengmei’s little brother cure his leg without asking for anything in return, don’t you know that actions like this are the easiest to move a woman? Just now, you helped her teach that guy a lesson as well. If nothing happens, then Huang Shengmei would definitely fall for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>She already fell for me, okay?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye ZIchen couldn’t help but retort in his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They already had a marriage string and the affability level was through 500, it already surpassed the limit of a couple.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Also, you got Huang Shengmei’s little brother to play professionally is for that girl called Jing Wan, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded, Jing Wan was the only person he knew that wanted to establish a team.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“See, isn’t that, right?” Liu Qing frowned and pouted. “That’s why I say you scheme a lot.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ugh.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>How am I scheming?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“The biggest problem that Jing Wan faces right now towards the establishment of her team is the lack of players. Wouldn’t she be thankful if you bring a top laner to her?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing Liu Qing’s words, it really didn’t seem like it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You look rather harmless, but you are really good at playing hot and cold. This girl is impressed,” With that, Liu Qing bowed with her hands folded in front.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen instantly felt troubled. He swore to the heavens and earth that he truly didn’t think so much. He purely wanted to help Jing Wan, he didn’t think of anything else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What did he sound like someone who committed countless sins from Liu Qing’s words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“From what you say, then having you by my side and finding a chance to revive you and help you take revenge is courting you as well?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Liu Qing twitched her mouth, “Wait till you actually do it.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This damn chick.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen got annoyed when he looked at Liu Qing’s face. However, he was truly reluctant to hit or scold her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After all, this girl was just so cute.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Buzz…</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen’s phone rang, he told Liu Qing that he’ll deal with her later, then picked up the call.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi, I did the supermarket stuff for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Ye Zichen turned extremely thankful, “I’ll be right there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Half an hour later, Ye Zichen arrived at the supermarket in his car.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There wasn’t any signage for the supermarket. This was something that he had specifically told Su Yiyun to do.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His supermarket wasn’t going to sell stuff to people, it was to sell stuff to deities.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How is it? Not bad, right?” Su Yiyun pointed at the stuffed supermarket with pride. He couldn’t be any busier these few days, but at least the result looked pretty good.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had helped him solve the trouble with Commissioner Liu and saved their family’s old man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now, their entire family treated Ye Zichen as their savior.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had always wanted to chance to repay Ye Zichen, but there was never the opportunity. This supermarket was the simplest thing he could do for Ye Zichen to pay him back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was why he worked full-heartedly these few days and sorted everything out as quick as possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great! It’s truly great,” Ye Zichen revealed a look of excitement. He didn’t think that Su Yiyun even would have helped him stock up. This truly saved Ye Zichen a lot of trouble.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have a friend that runs a food processing factory. I got this stuff from him. Here is his card, just go to him if you need to stock up with anything,” Su Yiyun handed Ye Zichen a card, which the latter received with a nod, while his gaze remained at the room full of snacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These treasures were all chips for him to get rich in the future.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun couldn’t help but smile when he saw Ye Zichen’s satisfied expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, stop being happy, I’ve been tired out these few days. Shouldn’t you treat me to something?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s phone rang. His shoulders immediately shook, and looked at his phone, then saw the Monkey King and co. speaking in the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: It’s finally over, that old kid, the Jade Emperor, bullshits way too much.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Outrageous!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: My son, you’re unhappy when I speak about your relatives?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: Monkey King, True Lord Erlang, can you two stop arguing?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: Retard, you’re helping outsiders now? Did you forget how Old Sun helped you back in the days?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha: Hehe, it’s so lively here, so much more than the other group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: Stop arguing. Didn’t celestial friend Nameless tell us to inform him when we finish our conference in order to talk about the spokesperson matter?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang: Yeah.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha: @Only Idealism, our conference is finished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but lick his lips and reveal a heated light from his eyes as he looked at the scrolling messages on the screen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi, what is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Ye Zichen came back to himself, then patted Su Yiyun’s shoulder with a laugh..</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Treating you to a meal is no problem, but it’ll have to wait a bit.”</span></p>
