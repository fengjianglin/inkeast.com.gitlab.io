 <p><span style>Chapter 556 – Third Fatty Jin’s Return</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Zuo Hongxin had finally noticed that the black-robed man was intentionally making things difficult for him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>But I’ve never offended an expert of this level… I’ve always been careful. Don’t even talk about angering him, I would speak extremely carefully to an expert of this level all the time…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, the black-robed man did not care about so much. He merely continued to count down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Two. One!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoosh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The tentacle appeared from the black-robed man’s shoulder area once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Hongxin also shouted out, “Don’t, I’ll choose!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Zuo Hongxin shouted out, the tentacle had already crushed one of the people he had brought over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was clear from the few times the black-robed man killed that he was killing Zuo Hongxin’s helpers according to their strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was killing them from strong to weak. At that moment, only one Sky Immortal expert remained amongst them, and he was only at the early stage of the Sky Immortal level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You spoke too slowly. You only spoke up after I finished the countdown…” The black-robed man shrugged with a smile, then looked towards Zuo Hongxin, who already had a pale expression. “Choose. Hurry up this time. If you’re too slow, then I </span><b>will</b><span style> continue.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Creak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Hongxin clenched his teeth, then eventually let out a long sigh, and asked the Sky Immortal level expert to walk over. At the same time, he also chose two other guest chamberlains who were rather capable in the fields of formation and fortune telling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir, I finished choosing,” Zuo Hongxin lowered his head humbly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The black-robed man glanced over with a satisfied nod, “Not bad, you know that the four people includes yourself. I thought you would choose one more, making me eliminate one for you again. Alright, it’s just you four. Enter!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master, then we…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You guys stay here. When that black-robed person leaves, then…” Zuo Hongxin whispered, and wanted to give more instructions, but the black-robed man, who sat on the ground, snorted unhappily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry up. Or do you want this sovereign to send you over!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Zuo Hongxin and the guest chamberlains beside him trembled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Hongxin gave a silent signal to the brighter guest chamberlains amongst them, then cupped his hands towards the black-robed man, and departed through the teleportation point.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You guys…” The black-robed man patted away the dust on his robe and stood up after Zuo Hongxin and co. left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the guest chamberlains who had seen how fast he killed the others gulped subconsciously and took a few steps back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t be nervous. As long as you guys don’t piss me off, I won’t kill you guys.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, he casually threw a couple of rocks on the ground, marking out a ten meters by ten meters square. “Enter yourselves, don’t make me force you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tap, tap, tap…</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the guest chamberlains immediately jogged over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they all entered, a barrier immediately erected from the stones, and trapped them within.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stay in there properly. You guys will be naturally let out, alive, when everything’s over, but that’s if… you haven’t starved to death by then!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xue Lian had intelligently passed the Snow Rabbit Clan’s meeting halls to Ye Zichen and co. The past few days for her had been frightening.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monarch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And another one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She already lost count of how many monarchs she had seen in the past few days, but she had definitely seen more monarchs than she had in her entire life before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems like there are more and more people entering Mount Biluo these few days,” Ruan Qingtian held a cup of floral tea in his hand. It was floral tea that Ye Zichen had kept in his phone while he was in the Modern Realm. “Brother Ye, your floral tea is pretty nice.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha!” Ye Zichen smiled. He was unable to remain as calm as Ruan Qingtian did under these sorts of circumstances. “Have you heard any news on Zuo Hongxin recently?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No,” Ruan Qingtian twitched his mouth and shrugged. “I saw them enter the other day, but I have no idea where they went afterward, nor have I seen them around these few days. But they shouldn’t have any interest in Mount Supreme, they came to…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ruan Qingtian raised his eyebrows at Zuo Mo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop putting on that look. Do you think I have no idea that he’s coming for me?” Zuo Mo rolled her eyes. “They are making a final stand, and want to finish me here, but there’s no way he’ll get that lucky.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t underestimate them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen did realize that they had plenty of experts around with Yang Jian, Jail King and Zhuge Hong, so it was impossibly difficult for Zuo Hongxin to deal with Zuo Mo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he still couldn’t help but to remind Zuo Mo not to be too careless. After all, nobody could guess just what sort of nasty tricks Zuo Hongxin might pull.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know,” Zuo Mo pursed her lips and smiled. Then she raised her eyebrows. “Are you worrying about me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm, the temperature outside seems pretty nice. Brother Qingtian, let’s go for a walk,” Ye Zichen stood up from his chair and stretched lazily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ruan Qingtian raised his eyebrows towards Zuo Mo with a smile, then nodded towards Ye Zichen, “I feel like this is a pretty good choice.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh, they’re pissing me off!” Zuo Mo stomped her feet with a pout as she watched the two leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I sensed someone go over there,” Ye Zichen, who was strolling outside the Snow Rabbit Clan’s village, glanced at the manor on the opposite side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Some people indeed went over, but none of them have any keys,” Ruan Qingtian replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We have to pay attention to those without keys. They might come and try to snatch it from us,” Ye Zichen squinted his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Naturally, that’s something we can’t avoid. It is just a matter of time,” Ruan Qingtian’s mood was unusually good, and he has not been troubled by the issue at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re optimistic,” Ye Zichen said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I just came here for some treasure. I don’t care about the inheritance at all. I already took the worst-case scenario in mind, even if my key gets snatched, since each key can take three people excluding the key holder, you can take me inside, right?” Ruan Qingtian smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ll see,” Ye Zichen couldn’t help but chuckle at Ruan Qingtian’s carefree words. At that moment…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahh, are you guys bandits? I’ve already ran so far, and yet you’re still f*cking chasing me!” A fatty with a sweatshirt ran in the front at a distance not that far away. Meanwhile, two men with eyepatches chased behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the fatty was being chased by them, the fatty was extremely agile, and the two weren’t able to catch up as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it wasn’t for the fatty stopping to throw insults, he would have lost the two ages ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you still care about your face? Who’s the bandit here!?” the two men with eyepatches wanted to cry. “Hurry up and return the key to us. Otherwise, the Three Swordsmen of Mount Tang will never be done with you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Three Swordsmen? You guys are just two!” the fatty raised his eyebrows and mocked. “What? You lost your swords, so you have to go and buy some?” the fatty ran forward with a giggle, while revealing his disdain towards them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows when he saw that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This familiar fatty, and the cocky tone…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Third Fatty Jin!”</span></p>
