 <p><span style>Chapter 264 – Dealing with the School Issues</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye ZIchen was speechless when he saw the messages.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>If something happened with the Heavenly Court’s school, then think of a way to solve it. Why are you coming to bother me?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that same moment, within the Heavenly Court’s academy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A group of three and four years old cried. The children in primary school did not study properly either, and even the celestial second generations were messing around with them…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just moments ago, a celestial second generation hit a child until he cried, resulting in the latter being sent to Old Lord Taishang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing did not know how to describe the situation in front of him either, so he just directly sent Ye Zichen a short video.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen saw the situation at the school through the video…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I really submit, I thought you people from the Heavenly Court were supposed to be smart. Could it be that you’ll only be able to do something when I make everything crystal clear for you?” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes in annoyance. “No wonder the technology in the Heavenly Court cannot compare up to the Modern World!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing was very displeased to get retorted at by Ye Zichen, a mere mortal. However, in order to solve the current situation, he could only push forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please help this sovereign.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen directly drove off after seeing this message and did not send any replies. As Taibai Jinxing looked at the chat that did not move for a long time…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, where did you go? Tell me how to handle it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can you be more responsible? This old man has no experience… What am I supposed to do about these kids!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can you say something?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing felt like he was going crazy. At that moment, several celestial children sat near his leg, while they scratched his pants.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What made him even more speechless was that he felt a sudden wave of warmth of his leg…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked down. A celestial child had peed on him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Seriously…” Taibai Jinxing scratched his hair in annoyance. His hair no longer flowed smoothly. At that moment, he lost all of his built-up image, while he scratched his hair into a chicken’s nest!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck I thought that establishing a school was a simple thing. I never would have expected it to be so hard.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>More importantly, the person who suggested it ran away!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“This sovereign is giving you the ultimatum now. If you don’t appear, then this sovereign is going to kick you out of the WeChat group.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop hurrying me, can’t you just wait a moment?” At that moment, Ye Zichen was buying comics in a comics store.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he moved all of those comics back in his car, he licked his lips and rolled his eyes, “Geezer, I’m telling you, don’t threaten me with kicking me out of the group. I don’t have a particularly good temper.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop bullshitting, tell me the solution!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen used his phone to scan and send all of the comics in his car.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing received your red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Flump.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A pile of comics fell down from the sky. Taibai Jinxing waved his hand, causing the comics to automatically line up in a line and levitated in midair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“These are?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What I sent you just now is called comics!” Ye Zichen messaged in annoyance. “These comics are used to educate those kindergarten children. With these, those children will calm down a lot.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then how do I deal with primary and middle school?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How are you dealing with them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I just got the celestial second generations to play with them, but they just start fighting randomly!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You guys are truly foolish!” Ye Zichen sighed. “The point of the school is to teach the students knowledge. How could you let them play?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then teach them what? Those celestial second generations are a lazy bunch!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Heavenly Court has plenty of celestial young masters, right? Every single one of them have some experience in cultivation and somethings that they excel at, right? These deities will all have children in the future, and those children would have to go to school, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you want to say?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing did not catch his drift.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Get the deities in the Heavenly Court to all donate some cultivation books. Organize these books according to their difficulty levels, then use them for primary, middle, and high school. Isn’t that fine?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That could technically work, but those celestial second generations aren’t exactly suited to become teachers…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You really are dumb.” Ye Zichen shook his head. “Go and find Yue Lao, ask him who those celestial second generations at school are interested in. As long as you bring the targets of their affection over, then the problems will be solved.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing suddenly felt like he had an epiphany as he saw Ye Zichen’s messages.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Amazing!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why did I never think of it? Those celestial second generations are no longer young, their celestial hearts have started to move…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need for the courtesy. Just don’t annoy me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Ye Zichen drove back to his mansion, he saw that the Quattroporte had already been driven back. Ye Zichen parked the car in his yard, then got out. When he entered the mansion, he saw Lil’ White run towards him with his tongue stuck out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen squatted down to pat Lil’ White’s head, while Mother Ye smiled, “You came back! You’re just in time, I have to pick Tiantian up from school.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm,” Ye Zichen nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mother Ye walked over and whispered, “Your Jinglei-jie is in a bad mood, go and chat a bit with her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded, then walked to sit down by Mu Jinglei’s side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jinglei-jie!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, when did you come back!” Mu Jinglei, who had been silent until then, raised his eyebrows, and looked to the side subconsciously. “Auntie Ye was here just now…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My mother went to pick up Tiantian,” Ye Zichen replied with a soft smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tiantian. That little girl is pretty cute,” Mu Jinglei giggled. “Oh yeah, I heard Lil’ Chuang say that he’s been working for you recently!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm!” Ye Zichen nodded with a smile. “Lil’ Chuang is now working in one of my jewelry stores!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, then I don’t need to worry anymore,” With that, Mu Jinglei stood up from the chair, then stretched lazily. “Sis is a bit tired, so I’m going back to rest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Ye Zichen watched Mu Jinglei leave, Ye Zichen hooked his finger at Lil’ White, “Has Jinglei-jie continuously been like this recently?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“More or less!” Lil’ White’s ears dipped. “I have been trying very hard to make her happy, but it's no use!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is going to be hard!” Ye Zichen frowned. He didn’t think that Li En’s matter would cause such a large impact for Mu Jinglei. </span><i><span style>It seems like I’ll have to let time slowly wash away the wounds in her heart.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shrugged helplessly, then took out a cigarette, which he lit for himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before he smoked a few mouthfuls, his phone rang again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He hadn’t seen her for several days, and he did want to ask her about Wei Chen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Keke, what is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen-ge!” Xia Keke’s cute tone sounded out from his phone. Ye Zichen felt his entire body and heart turn happier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm, why did you think of calling me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, you truly are shameless. A lad like you is actually not going out to earn money properly, and instead doing this sort of thing. Even I’m ashamed of you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke seemed to be arguing with someone on the other side of the call. Then, Ye Zichen heard her speak into the phone, “Zichen-ge, come over quickly. Susu and I bumped into a pack of scoundrels!”</span></p>
