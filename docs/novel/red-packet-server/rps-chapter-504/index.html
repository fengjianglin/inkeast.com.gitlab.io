 <p><span style>Chapter 504 – True Purpose of the Birthday Party</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Second sis, isn’t this just a normal birthday party? Why are you guys spending so long to dress me up?” Su Yan couldn’t help but frown as she looked at the woman in the dressing-table mirror. At that moment, she anxiously wanted to go out, because she knew that Ye Zichen had already arrived.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t be in such a hurry. I already got Su Liu’er to go and receive the person you want to see,” the woman behind her smiled as she combed Su Yan’s long hair. She was no other than the second clan head of the Nine Tail Fox Clan – Su Zhu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan suddenly jumped up form the chair, then turned around and looked at Su Zhu in shock. “Big sis went!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you so surprised?” Su Zhu pressed Su Yan back down onto the chair in front of the dressing table and smiled. “That boy should be the one in your heart, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Second sis!” Su Yan suddenly blushed, then fidgeted silently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, at that very moment, another person entered Su Yan’s bedroom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was surprising was that the person who entered looked identical to Su Zhu, and even wore the exact same clothes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Yan, why didn’t you… Who are you!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Second sis!” Su Yan also turned around. However, when she saw the woman who had appeared in the room, she was completely shocked as well. She subconsciously glanced at the woman behind her, then at the woman at the entrance…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Two second sis’!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Yan, come over to older sister,” the Su Zhu at the entrance of the door frowned. “Who are you? You actually dare to transform into how I look. Just what intentions do you have!? Hurry up and reveal your true form right now. We, the Nine Tail Foxes, are not to be trifled with!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Zhu-meimei, your words are rather humorous. Aside from us, who else can take somebody else’s appearance in the Endless Beast Region, and cause you Nine Tail Foxes to be unable to tell?” With that, the woman behind Su Yan transformed into a monkey in golden armor, who held a peach in his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So it’s actually you. Why did you come here?” Su Zhu’s tense expression relaxed. The monkey in front of her was in some ways one of their own.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I naturally came here for my Third Bro. About this… Lil’ Zhu, you should understand, right?” the monkey smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For some reason, a smile also surfaced on Lil’ Zhu’s face. Then, she walked in front of Su Yan, “Lil’ Yan, go out and chat with Liu’er-jie, and leave this place to me. Remember, don’t tell her anything. This is our secret.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay,” Su Yan could only nod in confusion, then left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Su Zhu also rubbed her hands in excitement, “That monkey contacted me half a month ago, but he merely said a bunch of random stuff. Since you came this time, then tell me, just what sort of huge commotion does he want to cause?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first thing Su Yan did after getting out of the room was send Ye Zichen a message on WeChat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen, who was wandering around with Xia Keke felt his phone vibrate, he immediately took his phone out…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s from Su Yan!” Ye Zichen said to Xia Keke, then opened up WeChat to look at Su Yan’s message, before sending Su Yan their location.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is Susu coming over?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm,” Ye Zichen nodded. Then he looked towards the surrounding guests with a frown. “Don’t you feel like the atmosphere is very strange?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How so?” Xia Keke raised her eyebrows in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Look at all these clans and families that came. The ones who have come are all men of a similar age to Su Yan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t that normal? Their families are telling the younger generation to come over and show themselves,” Xia Keke raised her eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen shook his head with a frown, “That’s not right. If that really is the case, then why are there so few women… Look, you can’t even see any younger girls, all of them are men. What’s more, these men are actually displaying hints of hostility towards each other.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, that’s true,” Xia Keke glanced around and couldn’t help but nod.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now, now, there’s something you didn’t get. All of them came to fight for the right of marriage,” a man with a peach in his hand suddenly appeared beside them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Marriage?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows. “Isn’t this a birthday party? What does that have to do with the right for marriage?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This birthday party is actually just an excuse. The true purpose of this gathering is to help the Nine Tail Fox’s third young miss find a husband. Why else would so many talented young men come. Plenty of them actually hurried over from the other continents…” The man finished his peach as he spoke, then took out another one seemingly out of thin air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Susu actually didn’t tell me!” Xia Keke opened her eyes wide in shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shook his head, “It might be that she doesn’t even know that it is going on. But now, where did you get this information?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s so hard about that?” the man replied, speechless. “From the looks of it, you guys didn’t know? Then why did you come…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“To fight for the right of marriage!” Ye Zichen smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing this smile, the man also smiled. However, that’s when he noticed Ye Zichen swinging his fist towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He quickly blocked Ye Zichen’s punch, then frowned as he said, “Bro, what are you doing!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You should be an opponent for me since you came here, right? One less opponent means that I would have a greater chance of victory,” Ye Zichen smiled meaningfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the man’s eyes lit up when he heard that, “Hey, heroes really do think alike. How about we work together?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Work together?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn’t come for the Su family’s third young lady. I feel like we can cooperate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Explain?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man immediately whispered something into his ear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You fell for her?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shh,” the man quickly covered Ye Zichen’s mouth, then frowned. “What are you shouting for? Something bad’s going to happen if someone else hears about this!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m just surprised!” Ye Zichen smiled coyly. </span><i><span style>It’s all because what he said was too shocking!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“So, what do you want to do?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My side will be fine, but it’s mostly on you,” the man hooked his arm around Ye Zichen’s shoulder, then whispered something into his ear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon, the two of them looked at each other, and smiled evilly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ai… Hehehe, let’s do as you said.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen took out his phone and handed it over to Xia Keke, who didn’t really understand what was going on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll leave my phone with you. I’ll be back very soon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Ye Zichen turned towards the man, “We doing it right now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We have to. Otherwise, it’ll be too late,” the man chuckled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately nodded, “Then… let’s go!”</span></p>
