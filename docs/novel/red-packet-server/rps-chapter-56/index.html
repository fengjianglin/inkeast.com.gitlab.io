 <p><span style>Chapter 56 – Lil’ White wakes up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, Gu Tian finally managed to get Ye Zichen to stay with a lot of effort.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he was still completely certain that Ye Zichen only got mad because he had said the wrong thing, but the direction he was thinking in was still correct.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you want to say to me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen leaned back in the chair and curled his lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Liu Qing floated above Gu Tian’s head and kept on making faces at him. This was something that Ye Zichen had told her to do…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since this bastard spoke poorly, then let him be taught a lesson.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Err… Can you tell the beauty above me to stop messing around first?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both Ye Zichen, who was sitting in the chair, and Liu Qing, who was floating in the air, were stunned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stared at him, but was unable to say anything as he gulped. Gu Tian raised his eyebrow and shrugged, “Young Master Ye, we’re the same kind of people.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen signaled Liu Qing to return back to the Dragon Eye. Then, he licked his dry lips as a spark flashed in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can see her?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, I also know that she’s a virgin ghost girl that died before her time,” Gu Tian’s lips revealed a bright smile. “Young Master Ye can be so close with the ghost girl, and also had an item that can accept her. Is Young Master Ye going to say that we’re not the same kind of people?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stayed silent for a moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed like this guy with a low EQ treated him as the same. Thus, after a brief moment of thought, Ye Zichen replied, “Alright, we are truly the same. But, what do you want from me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Actually, it’s not much,” Gu Tian took a sip of the drink on the table. “I was also there when Young Master Ye acted out at the barbeque shop.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fu Chengming sent you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen asked since Gu Tian specifically mentioned the barbeque shop, and the incident </span><i><span style>was</span></i><span style> rather huge. However, Gu Tian didn’t seem to be someone that needed to use the relationships of other people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did he ask you to find me for? He wants to deal with me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Tian raised his eyebrow, he didn’t think that Ye Zichen could actually guess from his short words that Fu Chengming had sought him out previously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This made him even more certain about his thought of getting to know Ye Zichen better.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fu Chengming did find me before. However, I refused after seeing Young Master Ye at the barbeque shop.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what did you find me for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s just to get to know you and make a friend.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t want to be your friend.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes towards Gu Tian and got up to walk out of the restaurant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Tian quickly followed and asked, “Why? How have I caused Young Master Ye to dislike me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The geezer that came looking for me me out at the school the other day was yours, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He threatened my family then. I hate other people threatening my family.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That wasn’t on purpose,” Gu Tian explained with a wry smile. “I would never threaten Young Master Ye with your family.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, but I still don’t want to be your friend.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why is that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Think about it yourself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen took out his phone to have a look at the time, then disappeared in the flow of the crowd within the mall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He hadn’t had a chance to buy Tiantian’s birthday present yet, how could he have the time to talk with this sort of person with negative EQ.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Tian thought about it on the spot for a long time, after a while…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He thought of Xia Keke once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Tian took out his phone and spoke, “Help me investigate a person.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, Ye Zichen bought a Barbie back to the mansion. Ye Rong became completely stunned when she saw the doll in Ye Zichen’s hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, you like these sorts of stuff?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This Barbie was the birthday present Ye Zichen had chosen for Tiantian in the mall. He only brought it here because he was afraid that the other people at the dorm would think too much into it,</span></p>
 <p><span style>He did not expect that even his own mother distrusted him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is for someone else.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing the explanation, Ye Rong let out a sigh of relief. This only made Ye Zichen sigh helplessly in his heart. He then asked, “Is Lil’ White awake?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nope, still sleeping.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Rong’s eyes showed a hint of worry. Lil’ White had been accompanying her recently, alongside the fact that Lil’ White was very bright, it caused her to like him a lot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ White’s recent situation truly worried her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lemme go and see.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen replied, then walked towards the living room. Ye Rong nodded, “Don’t go back to your dorm later. Mom will make red-cooked pork for you tonight.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ever since he brought Ye Rong here, Ye Zichen had barely kept her companyher. When he saw his mother’s look of anticipation, he really wouldn’t bring himself to refuse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Rong instantly smiled after hearing Ye Zichen’s reply of confirmation, then she quickly walked out of the mansion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ White was still lying asleep in his usual place. Even Ye Zichen got a bit worried since he didn’t get up after so long.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sat down onto the sofa, then looked at Lil’ White for a long time before calling Liu Qing out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s safe now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing stuck her head out sneakily and looked around. She only floated out without worry after seeing that it was Ye Zichen’s home.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That brat said that his name is Gu Tian, is he from the same place as the Grandpa Gu you know?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How would I know? But since he can see me and his surname is Gu, I think they should be family.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing twitched her mouth at Ye Zichen, then floated all around the mansion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen allowed her to wander around the mansion, then fell into deep thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style>People with supernatural abilities had already appeared in his life. Gu Tian might very well be what Chief Liu and many other people had mentioned to him…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Someone from that place.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He was about to come into contact with the people form that place, he wasn’t sure if it was good or bad.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most importantly, he didn’t want Liu Qing to get hurt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Tian’s words back then had revealed a lot of important hints.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He mentioned that Liu Qing was a virgin ghost, and specifically mentioned that she died before her time.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>There must be something more to it.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Otherwise, he definitely wouldn’t deliberately mention both of these points, and would have just called her a ghost girl.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A huge energy suddenly appeared from the mansion, while Ye Zichen was deep in his thoughts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen opened his eyes and saw that Lil’ White, who was lying down, had all his fur stand up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing also floated over after feeling this abnormality. She looked down at Lil’ White and said, “What happened to Lil’ White?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re asking me, but how would I even know?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was speechless. If he didn’t have that WeChat group, he would still be a mundane commoner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>How was he supposed to know the answer to such a difficult question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh wow, daddy feels so great!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ White still looked like a poodle, but what shocked him was…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ White talked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ White.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was unable to hide the shock in his heart as he shouted towards Lil’ White with open eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, boss.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ White wagged his tail and jumped out of his place, and revealed a flattering expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, you are my true daddy from now on. I’ll do whatever you tell me to do.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck, the dog spoke…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>If he took a short of it and chucked it onto Weibo, he might even make it onto the headlines.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Lil’ White’s “true daddy” way to calling Ye Zichen’s expression to sullen. He raised his hand and smacked its head, “Who the f*ck is your true daddy! I don’t have a dog son like you. Don’t bullshit, you should have evolved after eating the Howling Celestial Dog’s dog food!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course,” Lil’ White raised his prideful head cockily, but what faced him was Ye Zichen’s five-finger mountain once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop putting on airs with laozi. Say it, what secret technique did you learn!?”</span></p>
