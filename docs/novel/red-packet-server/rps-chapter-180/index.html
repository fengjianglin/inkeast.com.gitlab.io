 <p><span style>Chapter 180 – Landlord</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What was their relationship!?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Of course it’s a pure brotherly relationship!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Great Sage Sun rolled his eyes towards Fuxi like he was looking at an idiot, “What do you think the relationship is between the two of us!?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Gay friends?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Fuxi thought evilly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, he definitely wouldn’t say it. Ignoring the fact that the monkey might not understand it, if he did, it really wouldn’t be good…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can tell that Great Sage and that boy have a deep relationship, then we will leave him here. We hope that Great Sage can take good care of him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s no need for you to say that!” The Great Sage bared his fangs and held the Ruyi Jingu Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fuxi nodded slightly and waved his right hand, “I will wipe the memories of everyone here. I hope Great Sage can also leave this place as to not raise suspicions.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I, Old Sun, can’t trust you,” Sun Wukong wasn’t an idiot. </span><i><span style>What If these two people kidnap my bro after I leave!?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I ate so many delicious things of his, I have to protect his safety.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I’ll leave with my father first, but I hope Great Sage won’t let…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shoo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Great Sage Sun turned into a small fly and buzzed in the air, “Hurry up and leave!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fuxi and Suiren nodded slightly, then stepped into the air and disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The silence ended.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The guests in the courtyard acted like nothing happened as they continued their actions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Su Yan also came back to her senses, and saw Ye Zichen, who was lying on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Su also quickly squatted as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When that happened, Ye Zichen pushed himself up as he rubbed his head, “Why does my head hurt so much?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, what happened?” Su Yan looked at him worriedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shook his head and stood up under the support of Su Yan, “Why am I lying on the floor? Wasn’t I eating cake just now!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know,” It was clear that Su Yan had already forgotten what had happened just moments ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen looked towards the manor gate for some reason.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For some reason, he just felt that someone had appeared there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t you guys feel like somebody came just now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, haven’t it always been the three of us?” Su Yan blinked her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows, then grabbed a piece of cake from the table, and stuffed it into his mouth. “Delicious!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Great Sage, who had turned into a fly, flew around a few times in the sky, then slowly flew away with a long look at Ye Zichen after ensuring that Fuxi and Suiren had left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Ye Zichen stole two bottles of red wine from the birthday feast, then ran to the corner of the courtyard and opened his WeChat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within the Red Packet Server.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he entered the group, he noticed that a few more members had actually joined.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He scanned the bottles of red wine. Send!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen received your red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, this is the nice wine that you’re gifting us?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen immediately replied in the WeChat group after collecting the red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, it’s red wine for you guys. But about our group… Why did Yue Lao come as well!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I left that group,” Yue Lao suddenly popped out. “I don’t know what the hell is with Taibai Jinxing, he actually scolded me as well. This old one naturally requires face, and since Canopy Marshal was coincidentally talking with me about quitting the group, I just left at the height of my anger!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everyone should leave that crappy group!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy General also agreed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Taibai Jinxing has been one of the Jade Emperor’s favored people for so long, he really got a bit arrogant. Does he seriously think that he’s only second to a single person? I, Old Pig, just didn’t want to care about him, otherwise, I would have killed that old guy with a strike from my rake.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed like Taibai Jinxing had completely ruined Canopy Marshal’s face back in the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Otherwise, he wouldn’t say something like that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, that’s good as well. Ye Zichen will just screw up the group sooner or later, then he can just drag all the deities into this Red Packet Server.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Enjoy your drinks, I still have stuff to busy myself with!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Erlang Shen suddenly sent a message within the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Sheng’s manor in the Heavenly Court…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was too poor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though he was an important deity in the Heavenly Court, he only had a large and empty manor. There wasn’t even a single servant or fairy within.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Celestial Howling Dog, who had starved until it was extremely thin, squatted on the side and stuck out its tongue. Meanwhile, Canopy Marshal and Yue Lao sat beside the stone table, as the two bottles of red wine, which Ye Zichen at just sent over, was placed on it beside a gourd of wine. There wasn’t any food to go with the wine at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The gourd of celestial wine was also brought over by the Canopy Marshal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason they were like this was because of…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Poverty!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen remembered that Ye Zichen had told him before that he would teach him the way to earn money!</span></p>
 <p><span style>In his current situation, he must get the method to earn money…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Otherwise…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He’ll have to eat dog food this month, and eat dog the next…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, the money-earning method that you told me about before…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was stunned for a moment when he saw this message. Then he pursed his lips and smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This money-earning method… About this…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, if you are treating me a brother, then tell me. I’m nearly starving to death.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen wasn’t kidding when he said that at all. Why didn’t he have any fairies or servants in his manor!?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t have the money to employ any!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had to give out salaries to hire servants and fairies, yet the tiny bit of salary he gets from the Heavenly Court wasn’t even enough for him to repay his debts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then let me teach you something… Wait a moment!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment he sent out the message, Ye Zichen called Su Yiyun over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi, you still dare to come look for me? You didn’t explain to me about my little sister yet!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun walked over with a vicious expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes, “Stop pretending, can you get me a set of poker cards?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Poker cards?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun was surprised as he raised his eyebrows, “What do you want poker cards for!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have a use for them, go and find some for me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, wait a moment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, Su Yiyun walked over with two boxes of poker cards in his hand, which he chucked into Ye Zichen’s hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I only found two sets, but what do you want them for!?” Su Yiyun revealed a face of curiosity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his hand and pushed him to the side, “Go and chat up girls, I see plenty of pretty rich girls in this banquet, aren’t they all your type?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m more interested than you in comparison to those rich girls.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shuddered upon hearing that, “I’m not gay, hurry up and go and chat up your girls.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, he immediately chased Su Yiyun away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right before Su Yiyun left, Ye Zichen heard Su YIyun shout out, “Is this the way to treat your brother-in-law!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked around…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nobody was present.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Scan!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Send!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen, who sat beside the stone table, grasped his phone tightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His phone shuddered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen instinctively went to his WeChat and collected the red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shoo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two boxes of poker cards instantly appeared in Erlang Shen’s hands</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Celestial sovereign sent it over?” Canopy Marshal raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen nodded and placed the boxes of poker cards onto the table, “Bro, what did you send me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A treasure to earn money!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen hurriedly opened a box of poker cards…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fifty-four poker cards instantly fell onto the stone table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen picked the cards up one by one and looked at every single one multiple times in curiosity!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>How was this supposed to earn money?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, you sure that this can earn money?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pursed his lips and smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, I’ll teach you a way to earn money today, the name of it is… Landlord![1. Landlord / Doudizhu (</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dou_dizhu" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dou_dizhu</span></a><span style>) is one of the most popular Chinese card games.]”</span></p>
