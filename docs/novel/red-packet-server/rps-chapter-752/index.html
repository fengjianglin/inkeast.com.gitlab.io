 <p><span style>Chapter 752 – Trap</span></p>
 <p><span style>Did the Jade Emperor break through?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Indeed, he did.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After six months of quietness, the Heavenly Court became very lively once more. The Jade Emperor also called for several meetings in the Cloudy Palace of the Golden Arches.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After that, he declared that all deities should go to the Immortality Peach Garden where he had something important to announce.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Judging from past experience, an announcement in the Immortality Peach Garden was definitely good news.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the deities didn’t know what was the good news, they were all completely worried.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had no idea of what present they should present.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Some important deities even decided to stay at home if they didn’t think of something suitable to bring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, the Jade Emperor made six announcements in the chat group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The basic meaning behind them was that anyone not present will suffer dire consequences.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, the deities all hurry towards the Immortality Peach Garden with no other choice while asking each other what present they were bringing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the South Heaven’s Gate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Flame Emperor had a solemn look on his face as he arrived. The Jade Emperor breaking through was not a piece of good news for the Immortal Region.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While the Lower Three Realms were living in harmony now, the competition wasn’t just going to magically disappear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t fret, even if the Jade Emperor did break through, he won’t do anything to the Immortal Region,” Ye Zichen shook his head with a chuckle. Judging from how badly the Jade Emperor thirsted for the God Realm, he would definitely ascend to the God Realm as soon as possible after breaking through. He was definitely not going to remain behind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, Ye Zichen provided a lot to help the Jade Emperor to break through.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Jade Emperor was definitely not going to do anything to the Immortal Region due to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, he still had an ace up his sleeve.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ru!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen patted Flame Emperor’s shoulders, then hurried over to the gate. Coincidentally, it was the same people standing guard as the last time he arrived.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chancellor Ye,” the vice-captain of the guards quickly hurried over when he saw Ye Zichen. Part of the reason he even managed to become the vice-captain was due to Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re on guard duty again? Where’s the captain? Oh yeah, are you going to block me out here again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please don’t make fun of this one,” the vice-captain smiled wryly. “The Jade Emperor summoned all deities to the Immortality Peach Garden and said that he has something to announce. You must be here for that too. This one will not take up &nbsp;&nbsp;of your time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, then I’m going in.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Make way!” The vice-captain said to the guards behind him. All the guards quickly moved to either side of the gates. Since they were also people that benefitted from Ye Zichen’s kindness, they would not block his path even if the vice-captain did not give them those orders.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I guess the Jade Emperor really did break through.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen thought to himself as he walked through the South Heaven’s Gate. The reason for that was simple – he received a message from the Jade Emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a simple message comprised of two sentences.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I broke through.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Come to the Heavenly Court now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen did have some reservations about that before, but when he saw all the grandeur preparations that were being made, he knew that there was no mistake.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I wonder if the Great Sacred Emperor Equaling Heavens also broke through to the supreme level with him.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen arrived at the Immortality Peach Garden, everything was like the vice-captain of the guards had said, basically, all of the deities were there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The whole garden was filled with both lesser and greater deities.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All the deities turned to greet Ye Zichen. Of course, most of them merely raised their glasses from afar. Only the greater deities walked closer to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign is here too!” Barefoot Immortal walked over. He was a strange one from the Buddhist Region and generally stayed with the deities of the Heavenly Court instead of staying in the western Buddhist Region.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I had no choice, the Jade Emperor made it clear to everyone. I’m so going to get in trouble if I don’t come over,” Ye Zichen said half-jokingly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, Sky Sovereign, do you know what the Jade Emperor asked as to gather for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How would I know?” Ye Zichen shrugged. “If you deities who are in the Heavenyl Court don’t know, would someone like me who’s always down there know?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now, now, Sky Sovereign,” Barefoot Immortal raised his eyebrows. “You definitely have some news. Tell us a bit about it all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen merely pursed his lips. At the same time, Yang Jian, the God of Thunder and the other war gods walked in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they saw Ye Zichen, they quickly hurried over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, you’re here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was completely dumbstruck when he turned around. He wasn’t sure of how to react to what Erlang Shen was wearing at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A tuxedo…</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was once commonly seen amongst balls in the Modern Realm, but in the Heavenly Court…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Never mind, it was almost like a copy of the Modern Realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, Ye Zichen really missed his life back there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, time continued to pass by and he became stronger and stronger. He had wanted to return to the Modern Realm as soon as possible after becoming more powerful, but the truth was that he only became further away from it all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just like how the Jade Emperor was ascending, he was definitely going to ascend to the God Realm as well.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>If I break through and ascend, then when can I return to the Modern Realm and live that nostalgic life I once detested?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah?” Ye Zichen came back to his senses when he heard Yan Jian’s call. He nodded and patted Yang Jian’s shoulder with a chuckle. “The tuxedo really looks great on you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, I’m the top male god in the Heavenly Court,” Yang Jian replied without any hint of humbleness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, I am,” Nezha, who was dressed in a suit, wrinkled his nose.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t fight over this with me. I’m the adult one, you’re the kid one.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re making your Grandpa Sun unhappy,” the Monkey King’s cocky laughter rang out in the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The proud smile on Yang Jiang’s face was instantly replaced by a dark look as Sun Wukong descended from the sky in his famous war armor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Monkey, I’ve been holding it back for a long time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then fight me?” The Great Sage took out his Ruyi Jingu Bang without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop it you two.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen covered his face speechlessly when he saw the two argue again. </span><i><span style>They clearly care about each other, why do they have to argue all the time.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>While they did drop their weapons, the pair continued to glare at each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The surrounding deities were used to it already.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, a series of clouds flew by and the Jade Emperor descended from the sky with a man in tow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Greetings, Your Majesty,” all of the deities bowed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded towards the Jade Emperor with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Jade Emperor told everyone to rise with a warm smile, then walked in front of Ye Zichen, “Brother Ye, thank you. If it was not for you, then I don’t know how long it would take for me to reach this stage.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s no big deal,” Ye Zichen chuckled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, the Jade Emperor’s expression turned dark. He called out to the surrounding deities, “Capture him!”</span></p>
