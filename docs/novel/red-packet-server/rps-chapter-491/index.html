 <p><span style>Chapter 491 – Key</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sudden voice shocked Ye Zichen. He turned around to look behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s you!” Ye Zichen smiled, then took a deep inhale on his cigarette.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t seem at all surprised for my appearance here. That is kind of surprising,” the man in black stealth clothing and a dark hat smiled. Then he turned his gaze to the lit cigarette Ye Zichen held between his fingers. “What is that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cigarette. People around here shouldn’t have smoked it before, right? How about trying one?” with that, Ye Zichen took out his box of cigarettes and offered it to the man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thanks, but never mind. I’m not that sort of person who likes to try new things.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But you have to try it to accept it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen didn’t force the issue when he saw that the other person didn’t want it. He put his box of cigarettes back into his pocket, then looked over at the pavilion, where the villagers were. None of them seemed to have noticed that a stranger had gotten inside the manor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you come here for?” ye Zichen stretched lazily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man smiled, “This isn’t bad at all. Zuo Mo set it up for you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why do you say that? Couldn’t I have set it up myself?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man merely pointed at the surrounding spiritual herbs, “Didn’t you notice? The positions of these spiritual herbs make the Mo character.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You seem to think a lot about her. You like her?” Ye Zichen smiled softly, then quickly shrugged. “If you came to find me for her, then I don’t think there’s a need for that. I’m not interested in that mentally ill woman.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mentally ill?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s something wrong with your brain. Of course, I’m not saying that she has a disease or anything, it’s just a saying.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay. You speak in a very interesting manner,” the black clothed man pursed his lips, then shook his head. “But you don’t have to say so much to me. I didn’t come for her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then?” Ye Zichen replied with a bit of hesitation. </span><i><span style>If it isn’t for Zuo Mo, then I wouldn’t even have any relationship with this man.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m merely curious. Zuo Mo is a very proud woman. I’ve never seen her treat any man like she treats you. That’s why I came over.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She treats me in a very special way?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Very special,” the black clothed man smiled, then took out a token from his pocket and handed it over. “I feel like you have the potential to become my ally. This token is the key to a secret location. I can give you some time to consider. If you want to get more involved with me, then this key is yours. If you don’t want to, then I will take it back in person.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, the man disappeared from Ye Zichen’s sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stared at the token in his hand in shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Xuan-Yuan Xiang also walked over and took a glance at the ‘key’ in his hand, “I think I know what this key is for!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do tell,” Ye Zichen chucked his cigarette onto the ground, then stomped out the fire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Xuan-Yuan Xiang shook her head, “But I forgot.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just go away then.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Was that any different to not saying anything?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>After Ye Zichen kicked Xuan-Yuan Xiang away, he set his gaze upon the token once again, but at that moment, Xue Lan skipped excitedly towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen-gege.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as he was about to speak to her, the phone in his pocket vibrated intensely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen-ge has other things to get busy about, so Lil’ Lan, go and play with your Stone-ge.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen hurriedly left, leaving Xue Lan pouting unhappily with another emotion that begun to grow in her heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen returned to his bedroom, he took out his phone and saw that it was Su Yan who had sent him a video chat request.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Accept.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What were you doing? Why did you take so long to accept?” Su Yan knitted her eyebrows with an unhappy expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was eating with the villagers. What happened? Why did you suddenly think about coming to find me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah,” Su Yan smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Xia Keke popped out and made a face at him, “Zichen-ge, you’re in huge trouble. Susu and I already found out!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows in confusion. He truly didn’t understand what the two were referring to.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Obsessed man wreaked havoc in the Azure Sky Pavilion for a woman. That is the number one gossip from the Immortal Region. Is that obsessed man you?” Xia Keke giggled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately got angry, “Where did you guys hear it from? What obsessed man! I only went to the Azure Sky Pavilion to get even for a little sister from the village… This is definitely slander! I have nothing to do with her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t get so nervous. Susu and I didn’t say anything! Oh yeah, lemme show you someone,” with that, Xia Keke moved aside, and made space for another girl.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lu Lu!” Ye Zichen was shocked. “How did you guys end up together?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’re all in the Endless Beast Region, so of course we met each other,” Lu Lu smiled and showed her cute dimples. “Did you miss me after not seeing me for so long?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though Ye Zichen was looking at them through the screen of his phone, he was still able to feel the atmosphere becoming more nerve-wracking.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The three of them definitely care about my answer a lot. Any wrong words would cause a lot of trouble. I think that it’s better for me to skip the question.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Have you guys eaten?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You see that? I bet that Ye Zichen wouldn’t answer the question. Pay up, pay up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke laughed loudly in the video chat, while she reached out her hands towards the other people. Both Su Yan and Lu Lu could only glare at Ye Zichen, then took out two sheets of paper like the notes from ancient time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s all your fault. Susu and I lost a thousand yuan each,” Lu Lu bit her lips with a pout.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke popped into the video once again with a giggle, “I’ll give you half when we meet. Haha, I know Ye Zichen the best. You two said that he would answer. Seriously, girls, you’re too young!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So they were actually making a bet on me!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh yeah, Keke told me that you are in a city in the Immortal Region?” Lu Lu spoke up once more. Ye Zichen nodded, then heard Lu Lu reply. “Which city?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Maple City!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm, okay. Alright, let’s end the call here. We’re going to play games. Bye bye!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Lu waved towards him in the video.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had wanted to speak a bit more with Su Yan, but when he sent it video chat request over, it was denied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, Su Yan’s reply appeared on the phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop trying. I’m Lu Lu, I confiscated Su Yan’s phone. Be a good boy, sis will buy you candy when we meet!”</span></p>

 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Original Chapter Teaser:</strong>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p><b>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</b>Oh, you're finally here.</p>
 <p><strong>Dark Figure:&nbsp;</strong>(startled)&nbsp;Huh? Why don't you seem surprised at all?</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>I am the main character of the novel, so I am a genius.</p>
 <p><strong>Dark Figure:</strong> ...</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Well, it wasn't hard to figure out. I trampled on your honor, beat up your elders and your disciples, but what did you do? You merely came out and agreed to my terms.</p>
 <p><strong>Dark Figure:</strong> Hmm...</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Is she important to you?</p>
 <p><strong>Dark Figure:&nbsp;</strong>Who?</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>You know who I'm talking about.</p>
 <p><strong>Dark Figure:&nbsp;</strong>I suppose, but that's not why I came. I came here for you.</p>
