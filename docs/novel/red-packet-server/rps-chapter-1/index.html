 <p><span style>Chapter 1 – The Deities have a WeChat Group</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bing Cheng Polytechnic University.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a white mulberry grove near the university’s second campus. Originally, the college had planted these mulberry trees to bring more greenery to the environment, but after nurturing generations of students, it gradually became the go-to location for students to go on dates.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One was able to smell the scent of love that was floating in the air from a long distance away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yueyue, I bought the lemon juice you like.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen held two cups of lemon juice that he had just bought from the school’s drink shop. Just like other university students, he was enjoying the spring of youth with a girlfriend.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason that he had came here today was because his girlfriend had called him. He had excitedly run down from the dormitory under the contemptuous gazes from his roommates, and bought the cold drink…</span></p>
 <p><span style>But…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Splat.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The lemon juice in his hands fell to the ground. Ye Zichen stared blankly at the beautifully smiling girl. She was the girlfriend that incited &nbsp;his roommates’ jealousy, but right now, her arms were wrapped around another man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yao Yue, what…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was pretty much unable to believe everything that he was seeing, the corner of the girl’s mouth twisted up, showing a hint of contempt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, let’s break up. We’re not suitable for one another.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment she finished talking, a sweet smile rose up that was completely opposite to the contempt she had showed on her face before. She held Guo Qiang’s shoulder tightly as she smiled, “My boyfriend, Guo Qiang.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Qiang, the captain of the Taekwondo society in school. He had a good family background. They said that his father owned a chemical factory and he always drove a Mercedes X to school.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yao Yue, that’s your original boyfriend? I think he’s pretty mediocre!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Qiang looked at Ye Zichen with disdain. Since Ye Zichen was wearing a total of less than a thousand yuan, he did not feel the need to be wary at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yao Yue held Guo Qiang’s arm tightly and nodded in agreement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, actually, I was just messing around when I was with him. Qiang-ge is my true love.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Qiang clearly enjoyed what was happening in front of him a lot. He casually took out several thousand yuan and threw them at Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Take these and buy yourself some decent clothes, if you want to pick up a girl, you gotta have the cash to do so.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Guo Qiang wrapped his arm around Yao Yue’s waist before walking out of the patch of trees towards the hotel outside the school with a savage sneer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ever since Ye Zichen had seen Yao Yue with Guo Qiang, he’d laid on the bed with his blanket over his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone in the dorm knew about his situation, but even though they wanted to comfort him, they were unsure of how to begin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ol’ Five, get up, let’s go out and eat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kang Peng tugged on Ye Zichen’s blanket, but Ye Zichen, who was on the bed, did not have any reaction at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Never mind, Ol’ Five is in a bad mood. Let’s go out, we’ll bring something back for him later.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The people at the dorm all left from the room with a sigh, causing the entire room to become empty once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s phone suddenly rang. He was still on the bed and he immediately flipped over the blanket and picked up the phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had thought that Yao Yue had just messaged him, but when he opened WeChat, he noticed that someone had pulled him into a group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What the fuck.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen silently swore. However, just as he was about to leave the group, he got attracted in the name of the people in the group.</span></p>
 <p>Taibai Jinxing<sup><a id="ref1" href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup>, God of Fortune, Kitchen God, Erlang Shen, Lord of the Northern Dipper<sup><a id="ref2" href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup>, Old Lord Taishang<sup><a id="ref3" href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup>…</p>
 <p><i><span style>What the heck is this group.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>That was the thought that popped up in Ye Zichen’s mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, why isn’t anyone chatting in the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A red packet appeared in the group. The person that sent it was Taibai Jinxing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen decided to click it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was too slow, all the red envelopes had been taken!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Fuck, isn’t this group a dead one?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen casually clicked around to see everyone’s luck, but when he saw it, he was unable to retain his calm anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sixty-six red envelopes had actually disappeared in an instant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the things in them caused Ye Zichen to blank out a little, ...cultivation experience…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What is this used for?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He saw that the luckiest of those who got an envelope was the God of Thunder, he actually got 1000 cultivation experience!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Could it be money? If that was a thousand yuan, then that was a huge red packet! Had he actually stumbled into a rich people’s group?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen felt a random bit of anticipation for being in the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just at that moment, the people in the group exploded!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lord of the Northern Dipper: Oh wow, God of Thunder, you lurk all the time and I don’t see you sending any red envelopes, why do you snatch it before every one of us every single time?</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Sorry, I’m just too lucky. &lt;Insert 3 embarrassed emoji&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Damn, you guys took all the red envelopes just during the time laozi went to take my dog for a walk. Old Geezer Taibai is truly generous, but laozi doesn’t care about that. Who can send some money, laozi’s dog has been starving for several days.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kitchen God: Then you have to find the God of Fortune, he’s a rich person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lord of the Northern Dipper: Waiting for the rich person to share the wealth!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: God of Fortune, don’t pretend to be dead, I know you’re reading the chat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Fortune: Even a rich person would starve to death after getting screwed like this by you guys. &lt;Insert 3 eyeroll emojis&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Then are you going to send it or not!? If you don’t, then my dog is going to stay in your home!</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Fortune: Yes, yes, yes!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Another red envelope appeared on the screen once again. At the very moment that the red envelope appeared, Ye Zichen directly pressed on it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His phone vibrated, causing Ye Zichen’s shoulders to vibrate along with it for some reason as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>10 ingots.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the heck is this now.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Ye Zichen was getting curious about what the heck an ingot was, the WeChat group exploded again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone all praised the God of Fortune for being generous, except Erlang Shen, who was acting the villain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: F*ck, God of Fortune, are you able to take anymore away?</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Fortune: Erlang Shen, you were unlucky, how can you blame anyone?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: Haha, my son, do you need your Grandpa Sun to transfer some to you?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Bastard Monkey, you’re asking to get beaten!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Under the influence of his curiosity, Ye Zichen clicked open to see everyone’s luck, then noticed that Erlang Shen had only gotten 1 ingot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With Erlang Shen’s lead, everyone in the group, who happened to be carrying the title of various deities, all started flaming each other. Ye Zichen ignored them. He was merely curious about what exactly this ingot was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clicked open his wallet, and found that he had an additional function of a Treasure Chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After clicking on the Treasure Chest, he saw the shining ingots inside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Extract.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Extract the God of Fortune’s God ingot? 1 Gold Ingot = 10 thousand yuan</span></p>
 <p><span style>… 10 thousand!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sat there in a daze, if this is real, then didn’t that mean that he’d gotten a hundred thousand just now!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck, this must be a lie, right?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pressed ‘extract’ with a trembling hand. A withdrawal notification appeared on his phone’s WeChat not long afterwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was actually real!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before Ye Zichen could react, another withdrawal notification appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Withdrawal successful. Withdrawal of ¥100,000</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bank withdrawn to: Industrial Bank 9467</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately dialed his bank’s number without thinking, and checked his balance according to the instructions of the notifications.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Current balance available, RMB 100,000.59.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Plop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His phone slipped from his hands onto the bed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Real money!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen trembled. All of a sudden, the scene of Guo Qiang throwing several thousand yuan onto him appeared in front of his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the next moment, he quickly shoved on his shoes, then ran furiously out of the dormitory with his bank card.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He, Ye Zichen, was going to pay him back for the shame he had received several times over!</span></p>
