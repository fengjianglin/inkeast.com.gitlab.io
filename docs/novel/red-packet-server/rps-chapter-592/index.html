 <p><span style>Chapter 592 – There’s a Spy amongst the Ten Yama Kings</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ghost servants caught by King Pingdeng and King Chujiang in the Howling Valley kneeled on the floor of King Kṣitigarbha’s palace, while Blackie stood at the center of the palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, King Kṣitigarbha sat at the very end of the palace with Diting lying down beside him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Ten Yama Kings sat on either side of the palace with their eyebrows locked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tell me about the situation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Basically, these ghost servants were going to bring souls, who were going to be reincarnated, over to the Howling Valley where someone was consuming them in order to strengthen themselves. King Pingdeng and I saw this, so we captured them, and are currently handing it over so that you can handle this,” King Chujiang stood up from his chair. Although he spoke simply, he made everything very clear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Diting looked over at the ghost servants, while King Kṣitigarbha nodded and spoke in an indifferent manner, “I see. So that means someone in the Underworld is practicing demonic cultivation?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, this black-faced man is one of the many victims. King Kṣitigarbha, if you need to know any other details, you can ask him about it,” said King Chujiag.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need,” King Kṣitigarbha shook his head slowly, then pointed at the ghost servants and Blackie. “Tell them to leave, they are not needed here anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Blackie and the ghost servants left the hall, King Qinguang spoke up, “Did you notice something?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Know your wrongs, correct yourself, you still have time to turn back. Don’t make mistakes until the end,” King Kṣitigarbha said randomly as he departed from the hall with Diting in tow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment they left the hall, King Kṣitigarbha spoke up, “The Underworld is getting harder and harder to control. I think we might have to ask the Great Emperor to start doing things.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is someone of the Ten Yama Kings also working with the demons?” Diting asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Kṣitigarbha smiled, “You should know that better than me, right? You probably already caught the scent of the Demon Realm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A little,” Diting nodded. “I can pretty much sense which of them it is. I’ll pay more attention to them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t let them notice,” King Kṣitigarbha reminded him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course,” Diting nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Ten Yama Kings did not leave the hall after King Kṣitigarbha departed. King Qinguang frowned as he looked in at the other Yama Kings with a hint of coldness in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What Lord Kṣitigarbha had said was clearly directed at them. It was very obvious that someone amongst them had taken a wrong turn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the Yama Kings looked at each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sensing the strange atmosphere, King Chujiang quickly chuckled, “King Kṣitigarbha’s words might not have been talking about any of us, so don’t think too much into it. We, the Ten Yama Kings, cannot be worried and in a mess, otherwise, the Underworld will be unable to function properly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Qinguang nodded in agreement, “King Chujiang is right, let us return to our posts. But, whoever you are, don’t let me catch you. Otherwise, don’t blame me for disregarding our brotherly bonds.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, King Qinguang and King Chujiang left the hall with a snort.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Chu, who do you think it could be?” King Qinguang couldn’t help but frown after leaving the palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang shook his head, “I can’t tell right now, but what King Kṣitigarbha and Big Brother said just now will definitely cause that person to expose themselves. But I just didn’t expect one of us to actually go over to the other side.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, that’s his decision,” King Qinguang snorted. “Oh yeah, who else did you bump into at the Howling Valley?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I bumped into Master.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen wore</span></p>
 <p><span style> a completely solemn expression after returning to the fox yaos. When he had arrived, all of the fox yaos were gathered at a space in their back mountains.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a portal that had appeared there, which nobody knew where it led.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuan Hong, Su Zhu and the guards had encircled the portal, and prevented anyone else from getting within a ten meter radius around it.</span></p>
 <p><span style> “Brother Ye…”</span></p>
 <p><span style> At that moment, Yuan Hong saw Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style> Su Zhu also ran over in excitement and looked behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style> “Liu’er-jie and lil’ sis…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Liu’er-jie should be behind me. I didn’t manage to save Su Yan,” Ye Zichen said plainly. Then, he ignored the disappointment in Su Zhu’s eyes and pointed at the portal. “When did that appear?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“About two hours ago,” said Yuan Hong.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That should be around when I met Gu Li. I guess this is what he was talking about.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay,” Ye Zichen nodded, then went to the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was indeed very anxious to save Su Yan, but that didn’t mean that he was going to charge in blindly. </span><i><span style>God only knows how many traps Gu Li has laid for me on the other side of the portal. I don’t need to care about my own life in order to get Su Yan, but at the very least, I have to live until I get her back.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s more, when it comes to a petty villain like Gu Li…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I can’t count him on holding up his end of the promise.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen walked to a secluded space in the back mountains, then sat down and sent a message to Old Lord Taishang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Give me a few thousand bottles of Physical Recovery Pills and Spiritual nurturing Pills that complete stage Human Immortals can take.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha…” Old Lord Taishang chuckled coldly. “Weren’t you going to refine pills yourself? Why are you asking me for them? I heard Yue Lao tell you where the beast fire was. How was it, did you manage to get it? If you did, then I’ll give you the pill refinement manual. I’ve been waiting for a long time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang was merely mocking him. If beast fire was actually so easily gotten, then there would have been pill refiners everywhere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, I nearly forgot, I found the Beast Fire. Send me that pill refinement manual.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang was shocked. Thus, he immediately sent Ye Zichen a video chat request in disbelief.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Accept.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Show it to me, I don’t believe that you got the beast fire,” Old Lord Taishang frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled and lifted his right hand, “Watch closely.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Voom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A ball of light blue flames appeared in his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, Old Lord Taishang opened his eyes wide.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How’s that? Do you believe me now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph,” Old Lord Taishang ended the video chat, and clenched his teeth angrily in the pill refinement room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s so damn lucky. He knows the technique of spiritual guidance, and managed to get a Beast Fire…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, hurry up and send me the secret manual,” Ye Zichen said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A good five minutes later, Old Lord Taishang finally replied, “What were you asking me for again? Physical Recovery Pills and Spiritual Nurturing Pills, right? Wait a moment, I’ll send those over right now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, a red packet appeared on the screen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received Old Lord Taishang’s red packet. Physical Recovery Pill x30, Spiritual Recovery Pill x100.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, I already sent you what you wanted. My apprentices managed to cause their furnaces to explode again, so I have to take a look. Talk to you later.”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Original Chapter Teaser:</strong>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>In the next chapter of RPS…</p>
 <p>Ye Zichen prepares to cross the portal… As dangerous as it is, it's something that he has to do. He had to get Su Yan back. That girl is way too important for him.</p>
 <p>However, before that, he needed to prepare himself. He has Xuan-Yuan Sword, so he's alright on the weapon side if things, but that's not all he needs. He needed some recovery items, and who better than to ask Old Lord Taishang?</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, the Ten Tama Kings discuss about their findings at the Howling Valley…</p>
