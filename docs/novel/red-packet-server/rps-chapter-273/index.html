 <p><span style>Chapter 273 – The Five Loving Brothers</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The Yellow Emperor’s reincarnation is truly amazing!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It actually comes with plot armor. I was just about to get screwed, but then I suddenly get told that I leveled up!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen supported his chin with his right hand, while he took out a cigarette from his pocket and stuck it in his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My two bros are waiting for my help. You two… Sorry, but I’m in a hurry!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen knocked down the pair with two chops, then ran over to the Hou brothers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The situation of the originally equal fight instantly changed with Ye Zichen’s participation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the double pupil lady with scales noticed that Ye Zichen had advanced to the spiritual body level, she immediately ordered a full retreat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Hou brothers decided to stay and remain on guard with the mindset of not chasing an enemy with nowhere to go, while Ye Zichen walked to the place where they fought and picked up a piece of scale from the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The scale was a greenish-blue, and felt rather slimy. It was both cool and soft at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you two know who they are?” Ye Zichen handed the scale over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Hou examined it closely, “They should be half-beastmen, probably of the snakemen tribe!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Half-beastmen?” It was Ye Zichen’s first time hearing about them. “Are half-beastmen half beast, half men?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can think of them as such,” Fourth Hou nodded. “But half-beastmen normally only appear within the Three Realms, I don’t know how they managed to get here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But there is a point to note,” Third Hou squinted his eyes. “These half-beastmen aren’t particularly strong on average. What’s more, during my fight with them, I felt that they don’t seem to know how to use their Power of Heritage!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then…” Fourth Hou frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Never mind, leave it!” Ye Zichen waved his hand with a faint smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, Ye Zichen did have some ideas about why everything happened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These half-beastmen appeared in the Modern World most likely because of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Great Emperor Qingming had told him that this ninth life of his would definitely not be calm. At that very moment, he was like Xuanzang’s meat, which anyone would want to take a bite out of.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, it seems like he had gained quite a few enemies back when he was the Yellow Emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And the descendants of these enemies had been continuously looking for him…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It really is hard to stay alive!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As Ye Zichen drove back to the dormitory, he saw his roommates grouped together with a focused gaze that would cause people have some dirty thoughts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you guys looking at?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhu Yunbai was the first to turn around. He immediately pulled over a chair for Ye Zichen, then massaged his arms and legs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“One who is unaccountably solicitous is hiding evil intentions… Say it, do you want to borrow money or get boosted?” Ye Zichen took out a cigarette from his pocket and lit it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhu Yunbai shook his head, “It’s neither this time!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what are you acting solicitously for? Go away,” Ye Zichen smacked Zhu Yunbai’s hand away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Zhang Rui pushed his glasses up with a smile, ‘Ye-zi, tell me, are you responsible for this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?” Ye Zichen took a glance at the computer screen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhang Xiaohua, a member of the Ganshui Five, has turned himself in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The body of the news laid below the title, mostly talking about what the Ganshui Five did.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was also a short video in the middle…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mr. Police, please arrest me! I have committed crimes, please arrest me. I’m begging you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the video, Zhang Xiaohua cried as he grabbed the policeman and said that he had committed crimes…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Also, it could be said that Zhang Xiaohua’s clothes were messed up, and that he had a strange posture when walking!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It seems like his four brothers really loved him a lot!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi, tell us the truth, what sorts of tricks did you pull this time!” Zhang Rui raised his eyebrows. “I saw that you were smiling extremely lecherously when you smiled. You said that there will be a headline, so this is what you were referring to, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, I just wanted them, those five brothers, to get more loving with each other!” Ye Zichen shrugged speechlessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, another news popped up on the screen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Ganshui Five turned themselves in all together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An extremely eye-catching title appeared on a certain Bingcheng forum.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ganshui Brothers, not real brothers, but are as close as real brothers!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This author eloquently described the journeys of the Ganshui Brothers, but emphasized his words in the last paragraph, which he accompanied with a video.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The video was already heavily censored. Mr. Zhang Xiaohua of the Ganshui Five were pressed down onto the ground by four hulks passionately…</span></p>
 <p><span style>During that, the four hulks would occasionally physically fight in order to gain a better position.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, the comments below were extremely amazing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You guys now know why I’m still single after watching this video.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Look at that trap’s expression carefully, he has a look of enjoyment…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I heard that Zhang Xiaohua of the Ganshui Five just turned himself in, then his four waifus also did the same. Are they going to love each other until the end of days?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zhang Xiaohua said, ‘Uncle Police, I’m regretting it a little now!’”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled faintly as he read the comments, while his roommates rewatched the video several times and even chuckled…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s so pitiful!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You won’t understand his happiness,” Zhu Yunbai chuckled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of them laughed. It was a good thing for the Ganshui Five to get arrested.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Especially since one was able to find out that they truly had plenty of penci and Immortal Jump victims from reading the comments.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Ye Zichen played two games of League with his roommates before falling asleep on his bed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the Heavenly Court…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao did choose to listen to Ye Zichen’s ideas to start a dating show, and there was a very good reaction to it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Plenty of families even gave Yue Lao some red packets in hopes of getting their family’s child on the show.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After all, everyone wanted their family’s child to get married and have kids. They were naturally anxious when they see some families get their celestial fourth generations, while their celestial second generations did not even start dating yet!</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Yue Lao noticed an issue… The good reactions from the dating show merely came from the lower and upper class…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The higher ups had not noticed it at all. If this continued, then according to the workplace survival laws that Ye Zichen thought him, he would be just wasting his efforts for nothing!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, little deity is facing some trouble!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen, who just woke up to go to the bathroom, saw the message on his phone, he raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What troubles is it now?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So lucky, Sky Sovereign is actually here!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao directly described the problem he faced to Ye Zichen, causing the latter to not be able to help but raise his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m telling you, this first show must be extremely shocking and spread through the Heavenly Court!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want that to happen too, but those that signed up…” Yue Lao hesitated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who told you to just wait for them to sign up? Don’t you know how to invite people?” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes. “Since you just started, many deities are just watching on the sides for now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then who should little deity invite?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smacked his forehead speechlessly. </span><i><span style>Why isn’t this gramps getting it!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Invite who? Of course he had to invite well-known people!</span></i></p>
 <p></p>

 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;">Dear Diary,</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Today, something amazing happened. Well, actually, to be perfectly frank, it wasn't a huge surprise since I am the main character of the story after all, but no matter. Basically, I found out that I have plot armor on. The reincarnation of the Yellow Emperor actually has an auto-include plot armor. That's freaking amazing.</p>
 <p>I have nothing to fear anymore. No matter what sort of tribulation or heavenly punishment or some random heavenly cultivation retribution that are mentioned in novels strikes me, I have nothing to fear. Plot armor is definitely the strongest armor ever.</p>
 <p>Also, I also managed to level up my cultivation level today, so not only did I evade capture, I also managed to seriously kick ass. Those half-beastmen thingies were no match for me in anything (except ugliness I suppose, they were definitely far uglier than me!).</p>
 <p>Oh also, the effects of the red strings are... terrifying.</p>
