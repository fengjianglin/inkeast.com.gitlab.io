 <p><span style>Chapter 172 – The Underworld’s Nightmare</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How is it, did he reply yet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked over. The Great Sage scratched his face when he still didn’t get any reply.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He actually dared to not reply to I, Old Sun.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>From what he thought, King Chujiang should have replied instantly when he sent the message. It had already been a minute, and there was no reply, so he felt like he lost a lot of face in front of his bro.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“King Chujiang, I, Old Sun, am seeking you out…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang, who just had stood up from the ground, trembled when he heard the phone vibrate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He could still clearly remember the days when the monkey wreaked havoc in the Underworld…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great Sage!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang gulped and replied carefully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Buzz…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Great Sage’s phone buzzed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He replied!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>He really was intentionally avoiding me.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen cursed in his heart, and said to the Great Sage, “Ask him why isn’t he replying to me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Click click.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Great Sage tapped the screen and sent a message over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you ignoring my bro?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Brother!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang, who was sitting within the hall paused for a moment. The Great Sage’s brother…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The Canopy Marshal?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“The Canopy Marshal did not seek out this little deity!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but to feel a bit more impressed by the Great Sage when he saw King Chujiang’s reply.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>King Chujiang truly placed himself in a very low position.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>When King Chujiang chatted with me, he was still going like “this king”, “this king”.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Not that idiot. The bro of I, Old Sun, is Only Idealism…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang, who was within the hall, felt a sense of trouble.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only Idealism!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wasn’t that a mere mortal? How could he be brothers with this monkey.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Erlang Shen is his brother, the monkey is his brother as well…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just who is this person!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Cold sweat flowed down King Chujiang’s forehead when he saw the Great Sage’s message, which he didn’t reply to. At the same time, Ye Zichen also sent him a message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“King Chujiang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This little deity is here!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>An instant reply.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Such efficiency. The Great Sage’s name was truly effective.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked over at the Great Sage, signaling that he didn’t need to talk to King Chujiang anymore. Then, Ye Zichen sent King Chujiang a message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How’s the fragment of Soul Pearl Yiyuan coming along?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gulp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang didn’t dare to speak the truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“About this… Kṣitigarbha hasn’t in the Underworld recently, he journeyed out…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bullshit!” The Great Sage suddenly grabbed over Ye Zichen’s phone and cursed. “Kṣitigarbha has to permanently watch over the cycle of reincarnation within the Underworld. You actually dare to lie to I, Old Sun’s, bro! I, Old Sun, thinks that you’re asking for a beating! Hmmph!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great Sage!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t try to get close with me, Old Sun. I, Old Sun, is just asking you whether you have the fragment of Soul Pearl Yiyuan or not…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great Sage, give this little deity some time. I’ll contact the Ten Yama Kings to ask for it from Kṣitigarbha right now. Please don’t be angry, Great Sage.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I, Old Sun, will give you three days. If you don’t give it… Heh…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t dare.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great Sage, not bad,” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows and smiled after taking back his phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Ten Yama Kings of the Underworld were terrified due to my, Old Sun’s, beating. Back in the day…”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bullshitting mode on.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>While Great Sage started to talk about his past achievements, King Chujiang gave out instructions at his hall, “Go, tell the other Yama Kings to come over quickly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Qinguang, King Chujiang, King Songdi, King Wuguan, King Yanluo, King Pingdeng, King Taishan, King Dushi, King Biancheng, King Zhuanlun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All ten Yama Kings gathered together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone frowned deeply when they heard the news from King Chujiang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That monkey is not someone that easy to deal with.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Yanluo gulped. Back when Sun Wukong inflicted havoc in the Underworld, it was at his hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everyone knows that, but Kṣitigarbha might not give us the fragment of Soul Pearl Yiyuan,” &nbsp;King Zhuanlun shook his head with a sigh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everybody knew the magnificence of a fragment of Soul Pearl Yiyuan.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>How could he easily hand it over?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“The first thing we have to do is sate that monkey. The other thing is that we can’t offend that master,” King Qinguang frowned slightly. “The fact that the master knows the monkey and Erlang Shen makes his position way too mysterious…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eldest Brother is right!” all the Yama Kings nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As for that fragment of Soul Pearl Yiyuan…” King Qinguang licked his lips and squinted his eyes. “The Bodhisattva has always been kind hearted. Although the fragment is something precious in our eyes, it doesn’t mean that it is also precious in the eyes of the Bodhisattva. If we tell the Bodhisattva the reason, he might hand the fragment over to us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then we…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll go speak to the Bodhisattva. King Chujiang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Present!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang stood up like a primary school student hearing a teacher call their name!</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no helping it, he was too tensed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he couldn’t not be tense since he came into contact with the monkey.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If they reach a disagreement, then the other side might very well come to the Underworld to cause trouble.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re responsible for comforting the monkey…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang’s face turned stark white. Talking with that monster was akin to sticking his head into a crocodile’s mouth…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, you. What are you afraid of? How can you not have the courage to do something as miniscule as this as one of the Ten Yama Kings?” King Qinguang frowned. “As for that master, isn’t White Impermanence rather close to him? Give her some benefits and ask her to put in some good words for us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, then let’s move!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment the Great Sage started to speak, he couldn’t quite stop. So he talked about everything from his actions in the Underworld to the Heavenly Court, then about his journey to the west and finally becoming a Buddha…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had seen all this in Journey to the West, so he didn’t have much appreciation for it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Zhuge Kongming had brought over a stool and listened intently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Great Sage only stopped a good few hours later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sky had already turned dark. When Ye Zichen saw that, he asked softly, “Great Sage, is this clone of yours returning to your original body or staying here…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I, Old Sun… will leave with you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although he was reluctant to leave this secret location, he did feel a bit disgusted by eating.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded and patted Zhuge Kongming’s shoulder, “Big bro’s going back, so stay here properly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem,” Zhuge Kongming nodded with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Ye Zichen left the supermarket after reminding Zhuge Kongming several times to lock the door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Welcome back Boss!” Third Fatty Jin bowed towards the entrance, while being topless and only wearing a pair of trunks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This brat was definitely topnotch at ass-kissing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but recognize this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen even suspected that he managed to become Great Emperor Qingming’s disciple because he kissed ass extremely well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, are you going to take a shower or sleep?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sleep.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then…” Third Fatty Jin suddenly blushed and revealed an awkward expression. “Do you need me, Fatty, to accompany you? My tender daisy is blooming for Boss right now…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I… F*ck off!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen kicked Third Fatty Jin to the side of the tea table in the living room. Yet, when Third Fatty fell onto the tea table, he directly laid down and called out loudly!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m ready anytime!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen cursed silently a few times, then returned to his bedroom as he rolled his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He saw many notifications of White Impermanence sending him messages, and one of them even included a red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received White Impermanence’s red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soul-Restraining Lock x1</span></p>
 <p><span style>Heaven and Earth Merits x5000</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why did she send gifts without saying anything?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clicked on the Yinyang Box.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soul-Restraining Lock: Able to lock and extract the soul within a person. It can be used on any spiritual body.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the hell is this?</span></i></p>
