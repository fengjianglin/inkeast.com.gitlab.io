 <p><span style>Chapter 714 – Regaining the Cities</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian, who had donned a silver armor, thrust his lance into a demon cavalryman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Nezha was holding his Heaven and Earth Rings, while his long red ribbon spiraled around him, as many demon corpses laid underneath his feet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maple City’s defense was as thin as paper without Black Dragon there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Under Yang Jian and Nezha’s lead, the heavenly soldiers attacked from both inside and outside, and managed to take over Maple City without a single lost soldier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The flags of both of them fluttered in the air on top of the city, while all the demons scurried away frantically.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Weaklings,” Yang Jian twitched his mouth in disdain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Gou Yuzhan, who was holding a staff, walked over. He glanced up at the flags above the city and raised his eyebrows, “Why isn’t my flag here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You?” Yang Jian twitched his mouth and checked Gou Yuzhan out. After staying in Maple City for so long, he naturally knew about Gou Yuzhan. “What did you do? Why should your flag be up there?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what did you do? Why is your flag up there?” Gou Yuzhan tilted his head, while the hair sticking up on his head wobbled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rumble.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahh, I’m so hungry after all the fighting. Do you have any food?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gou Yuzhan suddenly rubbed his stomach, then ran off to find food. Yang Jian rolled his eyes speechlessly, then sent a message in the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This great lord has already dealt with Maple City. Do any of you need my help?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian felt like they ended the battle rather quickly, so he wanted to show off in the group, but what he didn’t expect was…</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were already a lot of messages above his when he sent the message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hundred Flower City has been reclaimed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Frost City has been reclaimed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Treasure City has been reclaimed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Fine. I thought I finished the quickest, but I guess I was the slowest.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian deleted the message without thinking. He had no interest in letting the people in the group see such an embarrassing act.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did Yang Jian delete a message? We’re all done here, do you need help?” The first to react was God of Thunder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian twitched his mouth. “No need, do you think your help is needed by this great lord? I already reclaimed Maple City a hour ago.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>They didn’t see the message just now, definitely not.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian repeated in his mind as he stared intently at the screen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are sure quick. As expected of the Heavenly Court’s number one war god. Damn!” A series of thumbs-up followed the message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Puny demons are nothing.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I guess they didn’t notice the message. </span></i><span style>Yang Jian’s vanity was satisfied greatly as he watched his screen fill up with flattery.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he chatted away in the group, it really was like he dealt with everything an hour ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But at that moment…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Beep.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A screenshot suddenly appeared in the group. Yang jina’s entire face turned green when seeing the image.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This great lord has already dealt with Maple City. Do any one of you need my help?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those cocky words combined with the profile picture…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wasn’t that the message I sent then deleted!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone else took a look at who sent the screenshot…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The atmosphere suddenly became very awkward. Yang Jian’s expression changed drastically as countless explanations flowed through his mind, but what he entered writing was…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damn monkey, do you want to die?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, my son. I, Old Sun, hadn’t taught you a lesson for a few days and so you know how to lie now? I guess I, Old Sun, will have to find some to teach you another lesson.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian’s eyes filled up with blood when words with a familiar tone appeared in the group chat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandson, I thought you were dead since you didn’t appear in the group for nearly a year. Stop bullshitting here. Fight meh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zezeze, you’re so cocky now? I guess your skin is really itching. Let’s decide on a place. I, Old Sun, will never disappoint someone who wants a beating.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m waiting for you at Maple City!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two of them stayed true to their characters, always fighting whenever they talked. Those of the Heavenly Court were already used to it. However, those of the Underworld and the Immortal Region were not, and all turned silent in shock when they noticed the change in the atmosphere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fortunately, God of Thunder spoke up to calm them down, “We haven’t dealt with all the external threat yet, so let’s not fight amongst ourselves. I promise I won’t stop you guys fighting after we kick the demons out of the Three Realms.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tch, you got lucky,” Yang Jian immediately took the chance to step down. Of course, everybody knew that the “you” he was talking about was the Great Sage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zezeze, look at how nervous you are. Don’t worry, you’ll have the chance to be beaten up in the future. We shall see.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment the Monkey King sent his reply, everyone else in the group began to change the topic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Great Emperor Qingming also sent a message in the group, “Brothers and sisters of the Underworld, Heavenly Court and the Beast Region, thank you for reclaiming the cities. I would like to ask you all to guard the cities further. Our people from the Immortal Region are going to leave the cities.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where to?” all of the people in the group were confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“To get the ley line!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My Lord, what should we do? The people of the Three Realms are still chasing and killing our people,” the demon sovereign was rather nervous. This was definitely terrible news for the demons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, Black Dragon was already in a terrible mood due to the mirage formation.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>If he hears the news, then takes his anger out of me…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Just let them,” Black Dragon snorted indifferently. However, he couldn’t help but think to himself. </span><i><span style>Could this be what he was after?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>If Ye Zichen is working so hard to maintain the mirage formation to trap the more powerful ones of us here after using the ley line as bait just to take back the cities, then it really was a terrible decision.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The demons might be at a disadvantage currently, and those from the Three Realms might kill some of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But that wasn’t going to change anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The victors of the battle were no longer going to be determined by pure numbers. It was merely a combat of the top combat powers.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>When the messenger arrives, so what if the Three Realms have plenty of people?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Numbers were not going to make a different in face of absolute strength.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon already expected the worst before he decided to come over. Everything he was going was just for the ley line.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As long as he gets the ley line, then everything will be worth it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All he needed to do now was to calm himself down and wait for the moment the mirage formation fades.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, at that very moment…</span></p>
 <p><span style>A ray of gold light shot up into the sky. Even those in the mirage formation could see what the gold light really was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a golden dragon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The ley line!” the stout Great Emperor Yonghe’s expression frozen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon’s expression also drastically changed after the exclamation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen! You dared to fool me!?”</span></p>
 <p></p>

 <p><strong>Demon Sovereign C:</strong> But our people...</p>
 <p><strong>Black Dragon:&nbsp;</strong>They may be able to take our cities, but they will not be able to cause us much casualties. What I wonder now is just why exactly did Ye Zichen trap us here. If it was merely to reclaim the cities... Then I must say that I'm too disappointed. I thought higher of him.</p>
