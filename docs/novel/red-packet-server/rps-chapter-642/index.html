 <p><span style>Chapter 642 – Trial Nulled</span></p>
 <p><span style>The trembling ground was very apparent. Even though the pair stood a few dozen meters away, they were still able to feel the residue movement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cui Fugui stared at the cave, while Ye Zichen walked towards it with a frown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you doing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course I’m going to save them,” Ye Zichen replied without thinking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cui Fugui grabbed him and called out softly, “Do you want to die? You want us, two mortals, to go and save them? Senior Brother Hu will be fine. What’s more, this is at the foot of the mountain where Yonghe Temple is, someone will come to deal with this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, two old men, respectively in a black robe and a white robe, appeared in the air above Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior, we are outer sect disciples who just finished the trial, but did not enter the sect properly yet,” Cui Fugui forced a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where’s Hu Qing?” one of the old man asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior Brother Hu already entered,” Cui Fugui answered respectfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So the guy inside is rampaging again. Hu Qing won’t be enough to deal with him. We should hurry in,” the white-robed old man frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The black-robed old man nodded, then entered the hole with the other elder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahh, that scared me to death,” Cui Fugui patted his chest and breathed heavily. “Those two old men are definitely a lot stronger than Senior Brother Hu. Their aura just now…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cui Fugui blabbered on, then finally raised his eyebrows when he saw that Ye Zichen did not reply, “Brother Ye, what are you thinking about?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothing,” Ye Zichen shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What he was doing was using his spiritual consciousness to check out the situation in the cave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The one who caused the commotion was an azure scale snake. It looked like a yao that was rather old, even though it was only around the strength of a mid-stage Human Immortal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite that, when combined with its impenetrable scales and its powerful body, it allowed it to fight at the very least with early stage Sky Immortals.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, since the two old men earlier were both Sky Immortal experts, they were more than enough to deal with it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, the snake seemed a bit strange. Its movements were still and seemed to radiate a deathly aura, which caught Ye Zichen’s attention.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hah, you’re just scared by those two old men, right?” Cui Fugui patted Ye Zichen on his shoulder with a smile. “Don’t worry, I won’t laugh at you. I’ll tell you the truth, I nearly pissed in my pants when they came by just now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that so!” Ye Zichen smiled with a nod. “Their aura was rather strong. As expected of experts from a cultivating sect.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course. Yonghe Temple is a famous large temple in the Immortal Region. I heard that the sect master is Yonghe Emperor, one of the Three Great Emperors. He is supposed to be extremely strong, and are only surpassed by the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors.” Cui Fugui had a dreamy look on his face, while his eyes seemed to lite up. “Getting to that status would mean countless wealth, and any girls would just throw themselves at him. If I can reach that status…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’ll be pretty difficult for you with your mindset,” Ye Zichen shook his head speechlessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cui Fugui immediately understood and said angrily, “Although meat and liquor goes down my throat, I still have the Buddha in my heart. Since the Heavenly Court’s Canopy Marshal can become an immortal, then what’s wrong with me enjoying the liveliness of the world?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You seem pretty intelligent in that front, you might as well turn Buddhist.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, the two began to chat pointlessly. At the same time, the commission within the cave seemed to become louder and louder after the two elders entered, only to gradually turn softer once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Approximately an hour later, Senior Brother Hu walked out with the two old men, while the other people who came to join as outer sect disciples followed behind them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of them were terrified as they looked lifelessly in front of them. There were also two who held the four-leafed herbs in their hands tightly, displaying just how resolute they were in joining Yonghe Temple’s outer sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“These children are terrified,” the white-robed elder shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The black-robed elder snorted, “How can they continue down the path of cultivation like this? This sort of tiny matter…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No matter what, they’re just mortals. You’re asking too much of them,” the white-robed elder was clearer easier to speak to than the black-robed one. He smiled, then tapped on the shocked individuals’ foreheads.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of them trembled, then began to scream.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, the black-robed elder got even more annoyed, then left with a cold snort. Yet, this sound caused the screaming people to all stop and peek at that elder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, they heard the white-robed elder speak up, “This situation of the trial was the mistake of the council of elders, but having so many outer sect disciples will be a burden for us, the Yonghe Temple. How about this, we’ll let the sect elders discuss about whether you can stay or not. Come with me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cui Fugui immediately thought of something, “Respected senior.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it?” the elder turned around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what about our trial?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ll naturally be treated equally in front of the council of elders.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then… wouldn’t we be at too much of a loss?” Cui Fugui complained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Brother Hu gave him a cue to stop speaking, but the elder merely shook his head with a smile, “If you are fated to cultivate, then you will naturally stay. If you are not, then you will be exiled even after joining the outer sect. Everything is fate, so there is no point of getting angry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cui Fugui tried to argue, but Ye Zichen yanked his arm, causing him to bitterly shut his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The elder turned towards Senior Brother Hu after seeing that Cui Fugui stopped, “Hu Qing, take them to the Elder Hall later. I’m going to inform the other elders.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood. Martial Uncle, take care,” Hu Qing sent the elder away with a bow, while the elder took a few steps forward before disappearing into the clouds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Cu Fugui was clearly displeased. They had worked so hard to find the four-leafed herb, and now it was all for nothing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your words were too much just now,” Hu Qing walked over and patted Cui Fugui’s shoulder. “It was lucky for you that it was Martial Uncle White. If it was Martial uncle Black, then he would have just slapped you to death.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I just don’t agree with this. We worked so hard to get the herb, and why was that? For fun!?” Cu Fugui’s eyes were filled with anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hu Qing shook his head with a smile, “Just keep holding the herbs in your hand. The council of elders will naturally favor you more if you can have the four-leafed herbs. Don’t worry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really?” Cu Fugui raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hu Qing nodded, then smiled at the other, “You have heard what Martial Uncle White said, so please come with me to the Elder Hall.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>While they walked over, Hu Qing led Ye Zichen and Cui Fugui at the very front.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cui Fugui repeatedly exclaimed in surprise while they walked over. Yet, that was when he noticed the injury on Hu Qing’s arm, so he couldn’t help but ask, “Senior Brother Hu, did you get the injury in the cave?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes,” Hu Qing covered the injury on his arm. “Actually, Martial Uncle is telling you to go to the Elder Hall for the entire situation in the cave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you mean?” Cui Fugui did not understand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ll understand when we arrive.”</span></p>

 <p></p>
 <p>What do I do now?</p>
 <p>I can't believe that such trouble is happening right now of all times. Like...&nbsp;damn, seriously? I'm trying to get into the temple to become a disciple there...</p>
 <p>Wait. No. What the hell? That's not what I'm here for!</p>
 <p>Ugh, I'm such a retard. Isn't this like the perfect opportunity for me to catch their attention? I'll just slowly walk over there right now. Keep my calm. Then, I'll find out where the fight is, and BAM BAM BAM! I'll beat the crap out of whatever is attacking Senior Brother Hu. Then voila! The elders at the temple will definitely ask me why I'm so strong. I can use that chance to proclaim myself as the reincarnation of the Yellow Emperor. There is no way that those Immortal Region high and mighty bastards can avoid me anymore!</p>
 <p>Yes. I'll do just that.</p>
 <p>After all,&nbsp;I'm a bloody genius!</p>
