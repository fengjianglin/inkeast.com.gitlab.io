 <p><span style>Chapter 472 – Zuo Mo Making Things Difficult</span></p>
 <p><span style>Truthfully speaking, Ye Zichen merely went to the auction house to test his luck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He never expected to actually get lucky. </span><i><span style>I wonder how high the price is. The famous saber had already costed several tens of millions, then this Barrier Breaking Grass…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Would it be more expensive?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Barrier Breaking Grass. I’m sure everyone knows its effects. It is suitable for those under the complete stage of the Human Immortal level. After ingesting, there is a ten percent chance of breakthrough. This is of extreme importance to everyone who is stuck at the breakthrough point. There are ten strands of Barrier Breaking Grass this time…”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Only those under the complete stage of the Human Immortal level?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ten percent chance of breakthrough?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It seems like there are some differences with the Barrier Breaking Pill that Old Lord Taishang can refine, but then again, that is normal. Zuo Mo should be talking about directly ingesting the grass itself, while Old Lord Taishang’s refining it into a pill.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen felt rather troubled by her saying that there was ten strands…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Mo did not say whether they were going to be auctioned one by one or together, and no one in the hall asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The main reason was that the customers on the seventh floor did not even dare to think of using such a luxurious item to breakthrough, while the rich people on the eighth and ninth floor did not lack that bit of celeste.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahem, excuse me…” In order to ensure that he could reach the Human Immortal level, Ye Zichen forced himself to raise his hand and stand up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone in the auction hall instantly glanced over at him. Zuo Mo, who was hosting the auction, also looked over in confusion. When she saw it was Ye Zichen, the smile on her face instantly changed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm, this gentleman over here, what question do you have?” Even though she continued to smile, Ye Zichen was certain that it was definitely a murderous smile, and in his mind, Zuo Mo was very likely to be pondering how to mess with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However…</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was nothing he could do!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I just want to ask whether your Barrier Breaking Grass will be sold strand by strand, or all together!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir, would you like to buy them individually or all together?” Zuo Mo answered with a smile, causing many dandies on the eighth floor to chatter their teeth angrily.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Our goddess is actually speaking to someone on the seventh floor, what’s more… she’s speaking with a smile.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course I want to buy them individually!” Ye Zichen actually wanted to buy them all together. The more things like Barrier Breaking Grass, the better it is. After Old Lord Taishang refines Barrier Breaking Pills using them, even if he didn’t need them, he can still give some pills to the people around him!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh,” Zuo Mo smiled. “Then I’m very sorry. We are selling it all together!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ha.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Liang, who stood underneath the stage, couldn’t help but laugh out loud. </span><i><span style>My sister truly has a grudge with this bro.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The Barrier Breaking Grass was actually supposed to be sold one strand at a time, since it was easier to get a better price that way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Zuo Mo actually changed her due to a single sentence from Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Sigh, she’s the only one that can do it. I don’t think anyone else in the Treasure Tower has this right!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, the dandies on the eighth floor also cheered silently. </span><i><span style>As expected of the goddess, she will never treat this sort of loser well.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As for Ye Zichen…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good, very good,” he forced himself to maintain his smile as he nodded towards Zuo Mo. He finally understood, the woman was intentionally making things difficult for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her earlier words were just to test him…</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was going to sell it as a batch if he wanted to buy them individually, and if he wanted to buy them all, then she would have sold them individually. No matter what, she was dead set on not letting him have a good time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir, do you have any more questions” Zuo Mo continued to smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen replied, “I have one more question.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If I don’t have enough money, then can I use items to exchange for items?” Ye Zichen licked his lips. He definitely had to get the Barrier Breaking Grass because only god knows when he would be able to bump into something like that again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had to enter the Human Immortal level, since he can’t just be stuck at his current level!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, but the Treasure Tower does not accept common items, you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Things from me are naturally not common items,” Ye Zichen replied with a glare.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Zuo Mo nodded with a smile, “Then, naturally. I’ll send someone to receive you right now. Just give him the treasure you want to get appraised.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Zuo Mo turned towards Zuo Liang and gave him a cue, “Say that we are not accepting it no matter what it is. Got it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sis, is there a need to mess with him like that? We, the Treasure Shop, have always welcomed business. Since he asked in this sort of place and sort those sort of things, he might truly need this Barrier Breaking Grass!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk, it’s his fault that he treated me like that. As for the Barrier Breaking Grass, it’s not like it’s a rare item for the Treasure Tower. If he really needs it, then I’ll just gift him one strand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It can’t be!” Zuo Liang opened his eyes wide. “Sis, are you still the older sister I know? You actually are gifting something to someone… Wow, you can’t have fallen for that guy, right!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk, it’s not like you can say anything useful. Hurry up and go!” Zuo Mo rolled her eyes in annoyance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Liang immediately ran over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Zuo Mo smiled towards everyone else, “Sorry, the auction will have to be put on hold for now. A gentleman wants to exchange using items, so we, the Treasure Tower, have to appraise its value first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, come with me!” At that moment, Zuo Liang had already walked over to Ye Zichen with a strange gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm!” Ye Zichen answered plainly, then followed Zuo Liang to a secret room behind the auction hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment they entered the room, Zuo Liang looked at Ye Zichen with interested eyes…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t look at me like that, I’m really worried!” Ye Zichen subconsciously took a few steps back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Liang hurriedly waved his hand with a smile, “Don’t misunderstand, I’m not interested in men, either. Didn’t you say you have items you want to exchange. Hurry up and show me what kind of treasures they are,” Zuo Liang robbed his hands in excitement. The things people in their line of work loved to do most was appraise treasures.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How much in celeste can you offer for this?” Spring-Returning Pill was a spiritual grade pill that cost a hundred cultivation experience per bottle within the Treasure Shop. That was the only good thing that Ye Zichen could offer. If that wouldn’t work, then he would have to start try using secret scriptures.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Liang, who was about to take a look at the treasure and refuse to accept it, was stunned. He looked at the jade vial in front of him in shock, then carefully uncorked it…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“P-Pill! You are a pill refiner!” Zuo Liang opened his eyes wide as if he saw a ghost, then quickly ran out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, a white-haired elder wearing a faint red robe with the image of a moon and three stars on it in the middle, entered the room with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can’t appraise pills. This is Shao Qing, our Treasure Tower’s earth grade pill refining master!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm,” Ye Zichen continued to nod plainly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The old man also nodded, then took the pill out and sniffed it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A surprised look quickly surfaced on his face as he raised his eyebrows, “Sire, I wonder if I can taste it? Of course, it will be treated as if we, the Treasure Tower, purchased it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure,” Ye Zichen finally stopped worrying when he saw the elder’s expression. </span><i><span style>It seems like pill refiners have a very high status in the Three Realms, since this pill seems to have shocked them a lot.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>As I thought, the Heavenly Court has no common items.</span></i></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Original Chapter Teaser:</strong>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p><b>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</b>(stands up awkwardly) Ahem... Ehm... Can I ask a question?</p>
 <p><strong>Zuo Mo:&nbsp;</strong>Hmmm? Oh, it's this gentleman over here, huh? You have a question?</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Yes.</p>
 <p><strong>Zuo Mo:</strong> Only one?</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Ugh... Yes, only one.</p>
 <p><strong>Zuo Mo:</strong> I suppose we do have time for one question.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>I want to ask, is the Barrier Breaking Grass being sold strand by strand or in a bundle?</p>
 <p><strong>Zuo Mo:</strong> What would you prefer?</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p><strong>Audience A:&nbsp;</strong>(whispers) Just who is that guy? He actually got Lady Zuo Mo to ask him for his preference!</p>
 <p><strong>Audience B:&nbsp;</strong>(whispers) I have no idea...</p>
 <p><strong>Young Master A:&nbsp;</strong>Damnit! Go out and immediately help me investigate who that guy is! I need all his information!</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Strand by strand...</p>
 <p><strong>Zuo Mo:&nbsp;</strong>Oh, sorry. It's being sold in a bundle. Oops. Maybe next time.</p>
