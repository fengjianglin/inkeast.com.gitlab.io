 <p><span style>Chapter 538 – Yang Jian’s Choice</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian was shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Fortune was confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder was stunned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal was dumbfounded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of them thought that there was something wrong with their ears.</span><i><span style> Just now, Sky Sovereign said he wanted the position of the master of the Heavenly Court?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Not only them, even the Jade Emperor’s smile froze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did Sky Sovereign say just now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I said, if I want the position of the master of the Heavenly Court, would you give it to me, Your Majesty?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jade Emperor’s expression turned for the worse. He looked down at Ye Zichen, and tried to understand why he had asked that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, are you retarded!?” Yang Jian yanked Ye Zichen. He’s truly foolishly brave now. He actually dared to ask the Jade Emperor for the position of the master of the Heavenly Court. Isn’t he seeking death!?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, is that what you really want?” Jade Emperor’s expression turned even darker.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, at that very moment, Ye Zichen suddenly snickered, “Do you think that I’m dumb? I was just kidding with Your Majesty. You immediately asked me what I want, but how would I dare to ask for anything?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, seriously. How about this, since Sky Sovereign doesn’t know what you want, then I shall grant Sky Sovereign a token. From now on, all deities shall treat you as if they were facing me, and this token will grant you access to anywhere within the Heavenly Court.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoosh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Jade Emperor threw a token into Ye Zichen’s hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately received it, and thanked the Jade Emperor, “Thank you, Your Majesty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign is too courteous. Alright, I’ve already rewarded who should be rewarded. Since Sky Sovereign will need to meet with many other deities, then this emperor will not take up any more of your time. However, I would like to ask Sky Sovereign to stay in the Heavenly Court for longer, and let us get closer to one another!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty, thank you for your favor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>When all of the deities departed from the Cloudy Palace of the Golden Arches, Yang Jian hooked his arm around Ye Zichen’s neck and raised his eyebrows, “Bro, you scared me to death just now. How were you so daring as to say something like that in front of the Jade Emperor!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, Sky Sovereign’s words caused me to break out in a cold sweat!” God of Thunder also patted his chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It was just a joke, is there a need to take it so seriously?” Ye Zichen smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, God of Fortune also spoke up, “Sky Sovereign knows that’s a joke, but if the Jade Emperor actually got angry, and wants to kill you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What would you guys do?” Ye Zichen suddenly asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the deities merely laughed dryly and did not speak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They really wouldn’t know what to do if the Jade Emperor actually wanted to punish Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Never mind, pretend like I didn’t say anything. Let’s head back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Back at the True Lord Manor, Ye Zichen sat on the stone chair in the square pavilion and looked up at the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian walked over with a plate of fruits, and sat opposite him, “Bro, it wasn’t all that convenient for me to say anything just now. Don’t take it to heart.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No worries. I know your difficulties since the Jade Emperor is the master of the Heavenly Court,” Ye Zichen smiled, then picked up and apple from the plate and took a bite.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If Jade Emperor really wants to do anything to you, then I will help you ask for mercy,” Yang Jian said seriously. “if he doesn’t listen, and nothing else works, then I’ll start a revolution with my army. No matter what, I cannot allow him to harm you, bro.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s hand, which was holding the apple, stiffened. He looked at Yang Jian’s solemn expression, then smiled. “Thanks.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regardless of whether Yang Jian was speaking the truth. Ye Zichen was very happy to hear him say that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But bro, why did you make that sort of joke with him just now,” Yang Jian asked in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He asked me what I want, and I didn’t know what to ask for, so I wanted to tease him,” Ye Zichen smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian couldn’t help but shake his head, “You’ve really got guts, you actually dared to make that sort of joke with the Jade Emperor. I’m telling you, my uncle’s seriously petty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, but I’m fine!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, the truth was that Ye Zichen did truly want the position of the master of the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the past few days, he had thought long and hard about what the system had said. He did find it rather logical. Since it was already rotten internally, then might as well destroy it. His question was merely a test, but he found out that he was in too much of a hurry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder and co. were people he were on rather good terms with, but when it came to sensitive questions like the one he asked, only Yang Jian gave an answer Ye Zichen wanted to hear. What’s more, Yang Jian had given it privately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If I was determined to get the position, not many people will actually stand on my side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seems like it’s still early for me to change the Three Realms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, Yang Jian…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Yue Lao hurried in. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen and Yang Jian both turned around, while Yang Jian chucked an apple at Yue Lao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao caught it frantically.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian raised his eyebrows, “Why did you come over here in such a hurry? Do you want to play Landlord?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I came to find Sky Sovereign,” Yue Lao returned the apple to the plate. He glanced over to Ye Zichen. “Sky Sovereign, don’t you need Beast Fire? I got news of it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the deities on good terms with Ye Zichen went to the South Heaven’s gate to send him off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you sure you’re not going to stay a bit longer?” Yang Jian frowned as he looked at Ye Zichen, who was going to descend.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nah, I have to go and take a look at the Beast Fire. What’s more, there are villagers waiting for me down there. They might be worried since I haven’t returned in so long,” Ye Zichen replied with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big bro, you’re leaving too soon. I’ve been on duty all the time, so I didn’t get a chance to talk to you,” Immortality Peach Fairy walked over with a pout.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rubbed her head, “I’ll come up when I have time in the future. Play with the Third Prince properly. I feel like the two of you suit each other rather well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, Sky Sovereign’s the best,” Third Prince Nezha giggled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy blushed, then pouted, “Him? He’s just a kid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who’s a kid. I’m all grown up!” Third Prince Nezha said in frustration.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shook his head and watched the two argue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Chang’e also walked over as she bit her lips. A confused look flashed across Ye Zichen’s eyes as he looked at the lady who was able to charm everyone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For some reason, I keep on overlapping her with Xiao Yumei!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have to be careful after going back to the Immortal Region. If there is anything that you can’t deal with, ensure that you tell Yang Jian and co., and tell them to go over to help you. Don’t shoulder everything yourself, understood?” Chang’e’s tone was filled with care. However, Ye Zichen was moved beyond that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even her tone is so similar to that of Xiao Yumei’s!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I really wonder how she’s doing in the Demon Realm.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He clenched his teeth and his fists.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a long time, Ye Zichen finally calmed himself down, then nodded towards Chang’e, “I will.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, he waved towards everyone standing within the South Heaven’s Gate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m off. Let’s chat in the group!”</span></p>
