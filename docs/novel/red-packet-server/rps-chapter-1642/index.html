 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>You could transcend even without the Emperor Star.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The God Emperor’s remnant’s words lit the flames of hope in the emperors’ hearts. Even the emperors of Ye Zichen’s alliance lit up.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Transcendence!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>If it was possible, who would willingly give up on it?</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Senior…” Gu Ku pursed his lips and looked at the God Emperor’s remnant. His expression couldn’t be considered friendly. He could feel that, after the soul fragment spoke a secret of this magnitude, everyone’s gazes had changed.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Their gaze was passion mixed with ambition!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>If the good fortune waiting atop that mountain was originally prepared for him and Ye Zichen, now, it was available to everyone.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>To the two of them, this wasn’t good news at all.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I know what you’re thinking. Back in the Second Era, I too was the Emperor Star. But the truth is the truth. I won’t obscure the truth just because you and I are both Masters of the Stars!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The God Emperor’s remnant spoke righteously. You could sense his valor even though he was just a wisp of soul.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It seemed that this was just his character!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Ye-zi, why do I get the sense that the God Emperor’s remnant soul is even more terrifying than the Demon Emperor’s? In just a few words, he’s stirred everyone’s hearts.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yang Jian, the Great Sage, and Ye Zichen were close friends, closer than anyone else here.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yang Jian sent Ye Zichen a divine sense transmission. The Great Sage and Pu Jingwan soon followed suit, all of them saying the same thing.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“It seems the Ocean Emperor and the others are tempted too,” said Pu Jingwan. “When we make our move, you’d best stick with us. We have to be careful of everyone else.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Zichen surreptitiously glanced at the great emperors of his alliance. It seemed they were really…</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In the Ocean Emperor and the others’ eyes, Ye Zichen could see blazing passion.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I trust them.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>To his friends’ surprise, after a single glance, Ye Zichen looked away. He could understand the fervor in their gazes. They’d come this far. Who wouldn’t long for transcendence?</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>If transcendence were ordinary or common, Zhou Wu wouldn’t have gone so mad in pursuit of it.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It was natural that the great emperors’ expressions would change like that. It would have been stranger for them to be disinterested.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Take, for instance, Gou Monan.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gou Monan had been quiet from the start, as if he were invincible. His imperial king cultivation didn’t stand out here.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But when the others were all inquiring about transcendence, he stood there emotionlessly. Even when the God Emperor’s remnant said anyone had a shot at transcendence, he remained as cold and aloof as ever.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Brother Monan, aren’t you interested in transcendence?” Ye Zichen arched his brow.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Brother Ye, there’s no way I’m not interested. It’s just, I’m well aware that even if there’s a chance at transcendence, it won’t fall to me. In that case, there’s no point getting my hopes up. I’m here in search of fortune that’ll bring me from an imperial king to an imperial lord. If I can get that, I’ll be satisfied,” said Gou Monan with a faint smile.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Brother Monan, you’ve sure got a practical outlook!” Ye Zichen laughed, but said no more.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Demon Emperor Kui Lin, however, burst into laughter.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Anyone could transcend!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Even though Kui Lin had long since reached the level where his emotions weren’t readable on the surface, he couldn’t resist bursting into wanton laughter. He was thankful for the remnant soul’s honesty. He’d been prepared to give up on transcendence, but his hope blazed back to life.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Especially since the Second Era’s transcendent was their Demon Emperor. Who knew? The Third Era’s transcendent might very well be Demon Emperor Kui Lin!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Senior God Emperor, might I ask when you plan to open this barrier?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Demons had always been on poor term with gods, yet now, Kui Lin addressed the remnant as his senior.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The confidence the remnant soul had given him made him desperate to enter the mountains and fight against his own destiny.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Open the barrier?” The God Emperor’s lingering spirit glanced back at the remnant of the Demon Emperor back in that grassy paradise. He’d delayed opening the barrier in hope that others would come too, and to give everyone an equal starting point from which to vie for the treasures and good fortune within the mountains.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But no one had come since Kui Lin and his group.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It seemed no one else was coming.</p>
 <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I can do it now, but are you ready?” The remnant soul sighed.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Everyone gathered at the foot of the mountain was already champing at the bit.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>We’re they ready?</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>They’d been preparing for this moment for far too long!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Regardless of whether they were imperial kings or imperial lords, they’d been stuck at their current level for a long time now. Their only hope of further advancements was the Transcendent Mausoleum.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Now that they’d learned that in theory, anyone could transcend, they were even more eager.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The God Emperor’s remnant took in their eager expressions, then floated over to the seal around the mountains. Then, they watched as his ethereal hand tapped against its water-like surface. The barrier, large enough to encapsulate the entire mountain range, then opened like an automatic door.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Several figures couldn’t wait any longer and charged right in. At times like this, every second was precious. If they were even a second late, transcendent fortune might land in someone else’s hands.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“There are a few things I must tell you all,” said the God Emperor’s remnant in a low voice after several people had already gone inside. “The mountains contain supreme treasures and fortune beyond imagination, but there are also numerous vicious beasts in place to protect them. You must be careful. If you don’t want to endanger yourself, go through this door. It will take you directly outside the mausoleum.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As he spoke, a silver door appeared a hundred meters away from the base of the mountain.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After it appeared, the God Emperor’s lingering spirit faded into the air, never to be seen again.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Those who’d started moving a little later quietly rejoiced that they’d stayed long enough to hear his warning. If they went in completely blind, it was hard to say how they’d end up.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Star Master Ye, shall we go into the mountains too?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Let’s split up!” Ye Zichen smiled at the great emperors. “Our presences are too strong. If we go together, we might summon hegemon-level vicious beasts. Besides, all of us are strong enough to hold our own. If we travel separately, we might be able to obtain more.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Alright.” Chap Feng, Bi’an, the Jade Pool Palace Master, Fox Empress Su Qingyan, and Head of the Fox Clan Su Wan’er all stepped into the mountains. However, Xuan Ji and the Hermit Emperor didn’t move.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When she saw Ye Zichen’s expression, Xuan Ji’s eyebrows shot up. “What’s that look supposed to mean? I’ve got to keep an eye on you.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I’m not particularly interested in the treasures hidden in the mountain. If I travel with you, my Young Friend Ye, I might run into something more interesting,” laughed the Hermit Emperor.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>There were fewer and fewer people at the foot of the mountain. The two Imperial Lords at Gu Li’s side had already gone inside too.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Shockingly, Gu Li chose that moment to walk over. When he saw the group staying at Ye Zichen’s side, his eyes flashed with a hint of a smile&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“How about it? Have you thought it over?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I have.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The others looked between Gu Li and Ye Zichen in bewilderment, unable to make heads or tails of their conversation. Gu Li chuckled. “Then…”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Before Gu Li could even finish his question, Ye Zichen stuck out his hand. “Looking forward to working with you!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
