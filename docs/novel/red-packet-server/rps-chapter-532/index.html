 <p><span style>Chapter 532 – Chang’e’s Visit</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen returned, he saw the “Staff Only” sign was still stuck to the door that led to the backyard of True Lord Erlang’s manor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he was no longer able to hearing the alluring melody. Ye Zichen took a look at the time. </span><i><span style>My phone is probably out of battery.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He pushed open the door. He had thought that the Seven Fairies were already taking a break, but when he entered, he noticed that…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>They were actually still practicing.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign,” when the fairies saw Ye Zichen return, they finally stopped what they were doing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To Ye Zichen’s surprise, he could not see any signs of fatigue in their expressions. All he could see was a faint bit of excitement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re pretty hard working,” Ye Zichen nodded with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Seven Fairies smiled in response, “Is Sky Sovereign coming to check up on us?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm, but I’m not in a hurry. Wait a moment,” Ye Zichen signaled for the Seven Fairies to rest a bit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he walked over to the table to pick up his phone. It was as he thought. Playing videos for several hours had already used up all of his phone’s battery.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He held up the phone to charge it, then after turning it on, he clicked open the video he had showed the fairies previously, then raised his eyebrows, “Are you all rested?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!” The Seven Fairies answered energetically.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded when he saw their passion, “Then go ahead and start!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the pleasant melody played, the expressions of the fairies changed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They seemed to be people born for the stage, as every tiny action reminded people of what a girl band should be.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was certain that if they were in the Modern Realm, they would definitely be the top girl band in the entire world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason for that was simple. They’re fairies, so they can apply special effects to themselves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the song ended, and the fairies finished their dance, they all looked towards Ye Zichen with gazes filled with anticipation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen could not deny that their performance was essentially perfect for beginners.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, Ye Zichen did not hold back his praise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It really was great. It seems like you girls are very talented in this area. Let’s end the practice for today with this. Go back and rest yourselves properly, we’ll be continuing tomorrow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes Sky Sovereign. Bye bye, Sky Sovereign.” The Seven Fairies waved towards Ye Zichen together, then departed from Erlang Shen’s backyard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but smile with a nod as he watched them leave. </span><i><span style>If they continue on like this, then I’m guaranteed to win the bet!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not bad, not bad. But just now, Lil’ Six’s actions weren’t too good, it felt a bit out of place with others. Synchronized dancing requires you to act in unity. Your actions were a bit stiff, you have to practice properly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had gradually become more and more professional during the training of the Seven Fairies. What’s more, with the Fiery Eyes of Truth, it was also as if he was an eagle-eyed coach.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moments earlier, he had noticed the irregularity of Sixth Fairy’s movements, so he immediately pointed it out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I understand, I will practice properly,” Sixth Fairy nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen dragged the video back to the beginning, then replayed it once more, “Start over again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, the Seven Fairies started once again. It was already the third song and dance they had learned in recent days.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, what should be noted was that none of the original songs had been performed by a seven girl band.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite that, the Seven Fairies were able to figure the performances out, as well as add in their own elements to easily change it into their songs and dances.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of it goes to show that they truly had talent for becoming a girl band.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rubbed his chin and smiled in satisfaction. He was very happy to see the girl band take shape so naturally.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong, dong, dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Someone knocked on the backyard door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen reminded the Seven Fairies to train properly, then stood up from the vine chair and walked out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sis!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person standing outside the door was no other than Ao Cunxin, the Third Princess of the West Sea and Yang Jian’s wife!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Ye Zichen had been staying in Yang Jian’s manor while he was staying in the Heavenly Court, he did chat a bit with her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did you come? Did something happen?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Ye, sis is going to ask you something. You have to answer me honestly,” Ao Cunxin grabbed Ye Zichen’s hand rightly, then dragged him to an isolated place in the courtyard, then spoke solemnly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sis, just ask!” Ye Zichen was rather confused, but he still nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you know Chang’e?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The questioned completely caught Ye Zichen off-guard. He thought about it, but didn’t say anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only after a while did he ask in a testing manner, “Sis, what is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chang’e suddenly came to our manor and said that she wants to see you. But you should also know that Yang Jian had a brief thing with her before. The two of them have also been chatting quite a bit recently. Sis is a bit scared, are the two of them… Lil’ Ye, you definitely have to tell sis the truth. Do you know Chang’e?” Ao Cunxin begged him worriedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was completely stunned by her words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He gulped, while his eyes opened wide.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You said Chang’e came to find me?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ahh, in the end, I’m not able to avoid it.</span></i><span style> Since Chang’e had not sought him out the previous few days, Ye Zichen had thought that Chang’e didn’t hear about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she just suddenly showed up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? Lil’ Ye, you don’t know Chang’e?” Ao Cunxin’s expression instantly saddened. She let go in a depressed manner, then muttered. “I knew it. I knew it…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, Ye Zichen immediately realized that Ao Cunxin misunderstood, so he quickly explained, “Sis, it’s not what you think. Yang Jian is infatuated with you. Chang’e did indeed come here to find me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then just now…” She raised her eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sighed in a worried manner. “It’s hard for me to explain everything just like that. Just tell me where Chang’e is right now, I’ll go and see her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, she’s in the plum garden in the front yard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Sev'ral plum branches stand at the wall corner there;</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ev'n in extreme cold they, alone, flow'r in delight.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>From a distance I know that they are not snow white,</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>For sweet scent floats and lingers in the freezing air.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The plum flowers in the garden bloomed, while a lady in a white dress, possessed of an otherworldly beauty, stood amongst them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen arrived at the plum garden following Ao Cunxin’s guidance. When he saw Chang’e, who stood amongst the plum garden, he immediately stopped.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>One visit will charm a city; a second visit will charm the country.</span></i><span style> Her skin was as smooth as clay, her lips were like cherry blossoms; she had clear eyes and a charming smile. The slender beauty merely stood there gracefully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It could be said that her existence could mesmerize billions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, she, who should be pursued by men, had a worried look on her face, which only invoked the pity of others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The lady in the plum gardens also noticed someone’s approach. When she looked up and saw Ye Zichen, who stood on the other end o the plum garden. She suddenly smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The smile was like a blooming notice, ever so charming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s you, right?” Chang’e’s tone had absolute certainty. Even though she had never once seen Ye Zichen before, she was till certain that the man standing in front of her was Sky Sovereign Nameless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s me,” Ye Zichen also smiled. However, his heart was not as calm as the demeanor he put on.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck, I met Chang’e. Now what!?</span></i></p>
