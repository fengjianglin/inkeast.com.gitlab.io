 <p><span style>Chapter 702 – Heaven-Shrouding Formation</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian and Nezha began their arguments, while the other people on the ground started to join in on the fun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Ye Zichen silently put his phone on the side of his bed, as the scene of his past life as the Yellow Emperor being forced into the cycle of samsara appeared in his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, little one,” the old dragon god suddenly called out in Ye Zichen consciousness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rubbed the ring, then entered the space within. The old dragon god did not choose to take the form of a dragon. Instead, he appeared as a human in a golden dragon robe as he sat in the center of the space.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I feel a very familiar aura from you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You must be talking about the Xuan-Yuan Sword,” Ye Zichen smile. He knew a bit about how Xuan-Yuan Sword was born. Rumors had it that the dragons had forged the sword for the Yellow Emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So it’s that sword,” the old dragon god nodded. “So that means that you’re the Yellow Emperor from back then?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes,” Ye Zichen nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The old dragon god grew silent. Seeing that, Ye Zichen didn’t say anything, and merely sat down cross-legged by the old dragon god.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had felt that his cultivation level started to rise even since he awakened the memories of the Yellow Emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it all came to him far too suddenly, so he needed some time to arrange everything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The flow of time within the old dragon god’s dimension was far quicker than the outside world, so he would have gone in eventually even if the old dragon god didn’t call him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Time ticked by, then after fifteen hours or so, the old dragon god awakened Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Someone’s looking for you outside. Hurry up and see. Also, bring me back to the dragon race as soon as you possibly can. Please.” Ye Zichen has never once seen the old dragon god request him with such sincerity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, before he could reply, his consciousness was expelled from the dimension by the old dragon god.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re awake.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Ye Zichen’s consciousness returned to his body, he heard a deep sound beside his ear. He looked around and saw a…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh motherf*cker, you scared me to death.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a face nearly identical to Ye Zichen’s. The only difference was that the man in white robes seemed to have been through a lot more than him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are finally willing to get rid of that damn censor on your face?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had thought of the possibility of the system being him a long time ago. However, he didn’t really understand why this system had appeared in his world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, he suddenly noticed that the white-robed man’s abdomen seemed to be stained with blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re wounded?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s just a small injury,” the white-robed man shook his head with a smile and signaled Ye Zichen not to worry. “You seriously know how to cause trouble for me. Didn’t I tell you to draw out the Xuan-Yuan Sword </span><i><span style>only</span></i><span style> in the Immortal Region?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t know what was going on at the time. I had no choice,” Ye Zichen shrugged helplessly. “I wanted to scare them a bit, yet you still didn’t come after a long time. I had no choice but to draw Xuan-Yuan Sword.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry, I ran into some trouble,” the white-robed man squinted his eyes and gazed out the window.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pool City was already devastated. The original courtyard of the City Lord’s manor was now in complete ruins, and the body of a young girl lay near it.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ahh, karma. I killed another Master of the Law. I guess this is the result of me exceeding them.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The white-robed man thought to himself, but didn’t show a sad look at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He already knew that to be the consequence the day he chose to come and find Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen didn’t notice the slight change in the white-robed man’s expression. He merely smiled, “There’s nothing to apologize for. We handle things as they come, right? Don’t blame yourself too much, this might be fate. But what did you do to the Xuan-Yuan Sword? How did it become so powerful?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The title of number one primordial divine artifact is not just for show. When you make it to the God Realm and look at the comments about the divine artifact rankings, you’ll understand just how strong Xuan-Yuan Sword really is,” the white-robed man pursed his lips with a shrug. “The unsealed Xuan-Yuan Sword will definitely catch the attention of the people above. It looks like I’m still going to have to clean up after you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, back in the Three Realms…</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen stepped out of the subdimension behind the white-robed man, he saw that Xuan-Yuan Xiang had already arrived in the outer regions of the Immortal Region, and already cleared out an area of around a hundred square meters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Done.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve troubled you,” the white-robed man nodded towards Xuan-Yuan Xiang, then walked towards the center of the clearing and took out nine pieces of stone, which he placed on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After placing the final piece onto the ground, the formerly plain stones suddenly glowed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A ray of rainbow colored light shot into the sky and covered the entire Lower Three Realms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is he doing?” Ye Zichen asked in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The white-robed man’s body was shimmering with a similar rainbow-colored light like the light that shot up into the sky. For some reason, Ye Zichen could feel the white-robed man’s lifeforce quickly flow away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon, the white-robed man’s hair turned from black to white, and he appeared to age by several dozen years.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ahem…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The white-robed man coughed up a mouthful of blood. Ye Zichen couldn’t stand it anymore, he wanted to stop whatever the white-robed man was doing, but Xuan-Yuan Xiang grabbed Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’ll die if this continues. What exactly is he trying to do!?” Ye Zichen glared at Xuan-Yuan Xiang, then roared at the white-robed man. “Do you want to die!? Hurry up and come back!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The white-robed man turned around to give Ye Zichen a warm smile, while the light around him brightened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What the hell are you trying to do!? You never discuss with me about anything. Aren’t you ‘me’!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s going to shroud the heavens,” Xuan-Yuan Xiang couldn’t help but sigh. “The Upper Three Realms definitely noticed that the unsealed Xuan-Yuan Xiang was unsheathed. He is going to shroud everything that happens in the Three Realms. That will prevent others from scrying for where the Xuan-Yuan Sword is.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then must he…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you think it is that easy? Shrouding it is the same as prying into the secrets of the world. He naturally needs to pay a price.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t need him to pay the price!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, grow up,” Xuan-Yuan Xiang scolded him. “Do you think he would have taken this option if he had a choice otherwise? He is a ruler, someone at the peak of the pyramid even in the Upper Three Realms. However, he still chose this path. Once this formation is set, it cannot be canceled. Instead of saying that you don’t need him to, pray that he can live after setting the formation up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but become silent after hearing those words.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Indeed, he wouldn’t have chose this option if he had any other choice.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen gazed at the white-robed man’s aged figure, he prayed silently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, at that very instant, a beautiful figure appeared in the sky and looked at the white-robed man with bloodshot eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gu Zichen, are you done being insane!?”</span></p>
 <p></p>

 <p><b>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</b>You've finally returned... Where were you earlier?</p>
 <p><strong>White-robed man:&nbsp;</strong>Long story short, something unexpected came up.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>The demons came, grabbed the traitors and ran off.</p>
 <p><strong>White-robed man:&nbsp;</strong>I know that already. Ugh...</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Wait, you're injured!?</p>
 <p><strong>White-robed man:&nbsp;</strong>It's no big deal. It'll heal. Anyways... you really do know how to cause trouble, don't you?</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>I had no choice, I tried to buy time, but you weren't around so I did what I had to.</p>
 <p><strong>White-robed man:&nbsp;</strong>Haha I suppose you did. Ahh, but I'll have to try and deal with some of the consequences later. Gah.</p>

 <p>Sorry about the lack of chapters the last 2 days. I had lots of real-life issues that came up. My flight back home was delayed and the airline managed to leave my&nbsp;suitcase in Zurich and now my suitcase's handle is broken when they finally delivered my suitcase back to me &gt;.&lt;</p>
