 <p><span style>Chapter 724 – Lord Gu Li</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Six is… hanging on the city walls.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most of the Demon Sovereigns were stunned. Some of the ones who didn’t believe the situation or didn’t see it clearly ran forward against Black Dragon’s objections.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Six!” The Demon Sovereigns who ran out shrieked. Then… they saw it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Six was indeed hanging on the wall. Judging from the state of the corpse, this brother of theirs who had been with them for tens of thousands of years had already been dead for at least six months.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who!?” Many of the Demon Sovereigns got along with Old Six, so when they saw him hanging on their own city walls, their eyes swelled up with blood as they roared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who was it!? Come out here! I’m going to murder you!” One of the Demon Sovereigns charged towards the city like a madman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Three, come back!” The rest of the Demon Sovereigns called out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the Demon Sovereign didn’t care. All he wanted to do was retrieve Old Six’s corpse to bury it, then slaughter the latter’s killer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My Lord…” Some of the Demon Sovereigns called out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon gritted his teeth, “Follow him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Six, I’m coming to get you now!” The Demon Sovereign charing in the front stared at Old Six’s corpse, but…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Three, behind you!” Another Demon Sovereign shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, a sinister sneer sounded out beside Old Three’s ear, “You’re too impulsive. You’re isolated from the rest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Three felt a chill down his spine. Although he acted in a seeming impulsive manner, he did search his surroundings using his spiritual energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, he never noticed when the owner of the sneering voice appeared beside him and was already pierced through when he finally reacted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He stood still with the person’s arm through his chest. His heart was still beating strongly in the person’s hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I recall you being on the best terms with Old Six amongst the Demon Sovereigns. Go and join him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man flung his arm, chucking Old Three to the ground. The Demon Sovereign didn’t even have a chance to struggle. He was already dead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everything happened in the blink of an eye, so when the Demon Sovereigns realized what was going on, it was already too late.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Third Brother!” Kua Hui shrieked. She nearly lost her mind the moment Old Three’s chest was pierced through.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She tried her best to rush over, but Li Min’e grabbed her by the arm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let go of me!” Hua Kui yelled. However, she was the weakest of the Demon Sovereigns, she stood no chance against Li Min’e.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let go of me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A hand slapped her across the face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you want to die as well!?” Li Min’e glared at Hua Kui coldly. “Mou Qing’s already dead. What can you do against an enemy he could not match? Die for your love?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Hua Kui appeared to be very slutty and always teased others sexually, that was all she did. She would instantly snap the neck of anyone who tried to go further with her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Demon Sovereigns all knew that Hua Kui held a single person closest to her heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The identity of that person was someone she only told Li Min’e. It was the third ranking Demon Sovereign.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know you must feel terrible now, but I share your despair as a woman.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How!?” Hua Kui glared at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Min’e could only smile lonelily, “Don’t forget that Yiyun stayed behind as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That tone instantly caused Hua Kui to remember…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Min’e doing everything she could do in the Modern Realm to be with Su Yiyun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Min’e…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright now, Kui. Let us calm down?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, the other Demon Sovereigns also noticed what was around the city.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The corpses of demon soldiers piled around the city walls, while a group of…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Abyssals crawled all over them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They couldn’t process what was going on when they saw the abyssals. The abyssal were truly too different from the ones they were used to.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, that was not why they were furious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The real reason was that the lowly abyssal were actually crawling over the esteemed demon soldiers and munching on their corpses!</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s unforgivable!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What a loving scene between sisters.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A meaningful chuckle sounded out from the sky. Soon, a purple-robed young man appeared in front of the Demon Sovereigns. His skin seemed to glisten like mutton jade under the light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, a bloody heart was held in the jade-like right hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The heart was clearly still beating and was very obviously still warm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are… Gu Li!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the change surprised Black Dragon, he was still able to recognize who the young man really was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This one is truly shocked that Lord Black Dragon is able to recognize this lowly one!” The young man laughed in false fear. Then, he twitched his mouth. “Yes. I am Gu Li. However, I am no longer the Gu Li that you remember.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? He is Gu Li!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How is that possible? He is making me feel pressurized!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wasn’t he only at the mid-stage of the Sky Immortal level? How did he become so much stronger?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Some of the Demon Sovereigns muttered. The change was truly too astronomical, they refused to believe that the person in front of them was Gu Li, whom they all looked down on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Surprised?” Gu Li smiled. He enjoyed the gasps that the Demon Sovereigns made when he looked down upon them from above.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That being said, there were still some who did not think much of Gu Li even now. The first ranking Demon Sovereign was one of them. He looked up with a click of his tongue, “Gu Li, I don’t care about your strength. But just what are you trying to do by assassinating two Demon Sovereigns!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Assassinate? Don’t make yourselves sound so amazing,” Gu Li laughed in disdain. “I killed them so very openly. That Old Six actually dared to investigate me in secret and ended up discovering my plans. I had no choice but to kill him in order to shut him up. As for Old Three, let’s just say that was a present for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you trying to rebel!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, you’re funny,” Gu Li shrugged. “Whatever, allow me to announce it to you now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“From today onwards, I shall be the master of this realm. You may address me as… Lord Gu Li.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Gu Li raised the beating heart to his mouth and bit down under the dark gazes of the Demon Sovereigns. Purple blood flowed down the corner of his lips, which he then promptly wiped with his fingers, then sucked on it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Man, eating it while its hot is truly the best.”</span></p>

 <p>Alright, I screwed up with time management real bad. Between the interview (which you should be able to see soon on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVfwsgGqyOWpJFwG6dpVgxg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Immortal Index's channel</a>), permanent overtime at work and family, I didn't find time to TL RPS at all (which means my&nbsp;stockpile ran out). Thus, I'm not going to be able to release any of the owed/sponsored chapters for you today. What I will be doing though is making sure that I TL at least 2 SMTM and 1 RPS chapter per day on weekdays and more on the weekends so slowly catch back up. Also, I'll be keeping count of how many RPS chapters I owe you guys so I can make it all up to you guys when I go back to Switzerland.&nbsp;<em>I also thought that I release Chapter 722 yesterday, but apparently, I haven't...</em></p>
 <p>Owed Chapters Count: 3 (+sponsored chapters)</p>
