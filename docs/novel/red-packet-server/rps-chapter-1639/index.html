 <p>“We’re here.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The forbidden region they saw from the paradise was, after actually stepping into it, actually not all that terrifying.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The volcanic region really did exist, and it was a separate space. Once Ye Zichen and his group reached the end of the danger zone, they could sense the barrier sealing off the area.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The trek was nowhere near as difficult as it seemed watching from that unearthly paradise. They reached the other end with practically no scares or danger.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“We’re here.” Ye Zichen initially planned to lead them through the barrier, only for the Ocean Emperor to call out to him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“We still don’t know what’s on the other side of the barrier,” said Xue Yang. “You’d best let us go first.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The other great emperors nodded their agreement. They naturally weren’t foolish enough to think that, if they went first, they could seize transcendent fortune. An opportunity like that was reserved for those fated for it. Besides, they were on good terms with Ye Zichen, and they weren’t as fanatically obsessed with transcendence as Zhou Wu. They really were just worried about the situation outside the border. If they went first, given their relatively profound cultivations, even if something happened, they could respond appropriately.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When he saw the look in their eyes, Ye Zichen understood how much the great emperors valued him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The end of the era loomed before them. They’d already come this far. They were only one step away from transcendence, so it was inevitable that they’d want to avoid anything bad happening to Ye Zichen now.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Alright,” said Ye Zichen. “Then I’ll have to trouble you.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Ocean Emperor took the lead and passed through the barrier. The Jade Pool Palace Master and the others soon followed.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Xuan Ji and Su Qingyan took up the rear, while Ye Zichen walked between the two groups.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It was only after they’d traversed the barrier that he discovered the other world waiting for them beyond it.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It was different from the inner palace they’d imagined. Once they’d passed through the barrier, the group saw a towering mountain range.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Mist swirled around their peaks, and they could faintly discern a single palace standing at the pinnacle.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Everyone who’d gone in before Ye Zichen, such as Gu Li and his group, were gathered at the base of the mountain. When Ye Zichen’s group appeared, Red Demon, who was sitting cross-legged on the ground, glanced at them disdainfully, as if shocked that the likes of them had come too.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The loli laughed and nodded at Ye Zichen. The stalwart man beside her had yet to show any signs of emotion. He just stood at the girl’s side, like her personal bodyguard.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You’re here.” Only Gu Li walked toward Ye Zichen.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>An Lu smiled like a cherub and dashed over as well. “Big Brother Zichen.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>That sweet laughter could melt just about anyone’s heart. Especially Pu Jingwan; when she saw that An Lu was alive and well, she sighed in relief. The sight of An Lu swallowed up in lava had been really hard to take.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Mm.” Ye Zichen smiled and tousled An Lu’s hair.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Then, Gu Li said, “At the time, I couldn’t explain to you in detail, but I figured that if I went in, you’d understand what was going on. It seems we really get each other!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Quit trying to butter us up,” snorted Yang Jian. “There’s no need to even question how happy we were when we saw you die.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In the face of Yang Jian’s vicious words, Gu Li simply chose to ignore them.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yang Jian felt as if he’d hit a cotton flower; that helpless feeling left him deeply unhappy. He longed to pull out his lance and run Gu Li through to vent his pent-up frustration.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Enough, Yang Jian.” Ye Zichen gestured for him to tone it down a little. Then, he glanced at Gu Li. Gu Li really did have insider info. He’d implied as much after they entered that paradise. It was even more obvious when Gu Li decisively forged ahead even after watching Red Demon “die” within the lava.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When he recalled what Venerate Spirit Treasure had said earlier, Ye Zichen’s eyebrows shot up. “Was that really a remnant of a former Demon Emperor?” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Li laughed but said nothing. Still, the look in his eyes was confirmation enough.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Zichen then turned to Red Demon and the loli. “Did you know too?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“A remnant of the Demon Emperor’s soul?” The girl batted her eyes, the very picture of ignorance.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Red Demon, however, pursed his lips and snorted. “That should be obvious to anyone who isn’t blind.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Then you…”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Remember, the group had taken the remnant for part of the former God Emperor entirely due to Red Demon.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It was Red Demon who, right from the start, had called him “God Emperor.” The remnant hadn’t denied it, which was why the others took it for a fact.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“What about me? If they couldn’t discern the truth, what good are they? No matter what I said, the choice is in their hands. Anyone with a brain can, naturally, see the truth clearly. As for those brainless fools, they’re not worthy to meddle with transcendence!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Red Demon’s words were as sharp as ever. It was hard to tell whether he was angry or not; everyone he said came out terrifying and murderous.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But his words, his declaration that those who remained behind were unworthy, stuck with them.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Far too many people had come in search of transcendence, from unknown recluses to members of the older generation who’d long since gone into permanent seclusion, as well as imperial kings who’d come to test their luck.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>People entered the mausoleum nonstep, all in hopes of a piece of the great cake that was transcendence.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But think about it. Were they really worthy? &nbsp;</p>
 <p>The transcendent mausoleum took all takers, but in truth, it existed to grant the Master of the Stars good fortune. The Ocean Emperor and the others were imperial lords, but they originally hadn’t planned to come here. In terms of cultivation, weren’t they superior to that bunch of immortal kings? In terms of reputation, well, they were leaders of Sacred Beast Clans or masters of a Divine Mountain.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yet even so, they’d never thought of taking transcendence for themselves. It wasn’t that they’d never longed for transcendence.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It was that they saw reality clearly!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;Those people who were obsessed with transcendence, or who hoped for a piece of the pie, were really insane! &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Senior Red Demon, from your words, you seem clear-sighted. So why did you persist on coming all the way here?” Gu Li suddenly turned to Red Demon and bowed. “I’m a demon too. I’ve always respected the Six Demons as my seniors, and the former Demon Emperor’s disappearance has always seemed fishy to me, especially since the six of you disappeared as well. That, more than anything, made me sense something was amiss.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When Red Demon heard that, he glanced at Gu Li. He emitted murderous energy from every pore; even when he didn’t deliberately display it, his attention was downright suffocating.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But Gu Li didn’t avert his gaze. Despite Red Demon’s ocean of murderous energy, he was neither aggressive nor servile.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I’ve investigated and asked around on numerous occasions to see if the former Demon Emperor had truly fallen or not. You said you want to avenge him? Then you ought to know that whoever targeted the former Demon Emperor will inevitably set their sights on you, too. So why did you choose to announce your intentions instead of lying in wait?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Resorting to flattery again.” Yang Jian sneered.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Zichen glanced pointedly at Yang Jian and lightly shook his head. He couldn’t help but feel that Gu Li’s words didn’t sound like flattery.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It seemed he was trying to confirm something.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I naturally am not the least bit interested in transcendent fortune.” After Red Demon said this, everyone else present instinctively glanced at him. When he sensed their gazes, he merely snorted. “You don’t need to look at me like that. Cultivators say that transcendents are peerless existences. Who doesn’t want to transcend? Especially for people like us, who’ve been emperors for a long time. I can’t fault anyone for wanting that. But I am not ignorant of the present situation, nor am I unable to recognize reality. I am not fated for transcendence. I naturally won’t persist and create trouble for myself.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“My reasons for coming here are simple. I just wanted to see the current Demon Emperor up close. But it’s a pity! He’s nowhere near as exceptional as I’d imagined!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When he said “nowhere near as exceptional”, Red Demon’s eyes flashed with particularly murderous light.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>His bloody aura spread out uncontrollably. When he sensed it, Ye Zichen could infer that this mighty demon expert’s hands were stained with the blood of millions.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But more than that, he could sense the depths of his hatred for Kui Lin.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He knew!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He ought to know that Kui Lin used some method to seize his predecessor’s throne, as well as many other secrets.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“It seems you…” Gu Li was just about to speak when he sensed the barrier rippling behind him. He swallowed his words right back down, then acted as if everything were normal.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Red Demon did the same. He sat cross-legged on the ground, just as he had when Ye Zichen’s group arrived.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Everyone’s behavior seemed perfectly natural, as if they’d never had that conversation at all.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Before long, someone stepped through. When Ye Zichen turned to look, he saw that this group consisted of Gou Monan, as well as the Demon Emperor and his followers. However, the Demon Emperor’s group seemed somewhat smaller than before.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>There were a few other imperial kings, too. All of them could be said to have brains.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>They’d watched so many people die amidst the lava, and yet, people still proceeded into peril, one after another. Furthermore, each person who’d chosen the lava was more famous than those who went before.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>For so many people to make that choice suggested there was something fishy about the lava. These newest arrivals were lucky; they’d bet right!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Many of their eyes revealed hints of delight. Clearly, they were rejoicing over their own intelligent decision, as well as the fact that they were now one step closer to transcendence.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Who knew? They might really have a chance of succeeding!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Indeed, it’s just as I thought!” Demon Emperor Kui Lin let out a burst of hearty laughter. He’d chosen to enter because he’d seen Gu Li and Ye Zichen, as well as their companions, go in first. He didn’t know the others well, but he understood the Ocean Emperor thoroughly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After all, they were old enemies. The moment he saw Xue Yang die in the lava, Kui Lin chose to follow him into the forbidden zone.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It was just as he’d anticipated; that danger zone was nowhere near as terrifying as it had looked from outside.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Brother Ye.” Gou Monan then walked over with a smile. “I’ve always thought you were extraordinary. How could someone who could create a whole tenth Divine Mountain die so easily? And indeed; you’re still alive!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“It seems you really trust me, Brother Monan.” Ye Zichen laughed and nodded.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Haha, fellow daoists, how about we enter the mountain now?” Some of the imperial kings were really champing at the bit. However, as soon as they spoke up, the others looked at them as if they were utter morons.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>No one else, neither Ye Zichen’s group or the Demon Emperor’s, had brought up such a thing.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>That was because they’d arrived later. Numerous others had already arrived here, and yet, the first to arrive, Red Demon, was sitting right there in front of them. The problem was quite obvious… It wasn’t a matter of “would they enter” but rather, a matter of “could they enter”!&nbsp;</p>
