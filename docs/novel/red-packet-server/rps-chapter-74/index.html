 <p><span style>Chapter 74 – Old Lord Taishang’s Special Medical Journal</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sent the cigarettes over to Yue Lao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your intimacy level with Yue Lao increased by 30. Current intimacy level: 180.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It can’t be, it was so easy to earn intimacy level from Yue Lao? These business transactions could increase the intimacy level?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Ye Zichen’s phone rang again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen scrolled over to his chats and saw that Old Lord Taishang had messaged him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang: Daoist friend, why did you give that geezer, Yue Lao, cigarettes?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang: And it had to be ten boxes!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Give!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It was clearly a business transaction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen immediately understood. Yue Lao and Old Lord Taishang were definitely together, and Yue Lao might be showing off in front of Old Lord Taishang with his cigarettes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Actually, it wasn’t really given. Yue Lao gave me some cultivation experience.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang: How much?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: 5000.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang: 5000 cultivation experience for ten boxes of Zhonghua cigarettes? Do you have any higher-class cigarettes there? I want to buy them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Clap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clapped. This was what he liked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He would receive money, while two people competed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Of course there are higher class ones. The Zhonghua we have is already a rather high-class brand. However, there are different types. The hard packaging Zhonghua in Yue Lao’s hands are the lowest ones.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang: Give me a few boxes that are higher class than his.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Soft packaging Zhonghua is 650 cultivation experience per box.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang directly sent a red packet over, which Ye Zichen quickly accepted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received Old Lord Taishang’s red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cultivation experience x6500</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang: Send it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Please wait a moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen happily ran over to the supermarket to buy ten boxes of soft packaging Zhonghua.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Scan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Send.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang received your red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your intimacy level with Old Lord Taishang increased by 20. Current intimacy level: 120.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Interesting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Selling goods could increase intimacy levels.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen hoped for Yue Lao to come seek him out again, but after ten odd minutes, there were no messages from Yue Lao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seems like he wasn’t going to come.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it wasn’t an issue, at least he earned quite a bit of cultivation experience easily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, he felt like cultivation experience wasn’t really hard to earn with his resources in the mortal realm and his celestial plate and title.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He could easily just open a convenience store in the group!</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, in order to do that, he needed to get into good relationships with all the different deities. Right now, he only knew a few…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The mission was important and the path was long. He still had a long way to go!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He saved the 6500 cultivation experience from Old Lord Taishang into his celestial plate!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your celestial position in the Heavenly Court has been increased.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Celestial Plate: Sky Sovereign Nameless (Cultivation Experience: 14500, Level 4 Celestial Official)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lucky Roulette activated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Start-up requires 8888 cultivation experience.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What is this for?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at the extra wheel that appealed in the Treasure Shop and randomly clicked on it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Congratulations, you received Old Lord Taishang’s Special Medical Journal (Level 1), it has been added to your Treasure Chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damn!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s hand shook.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang’s Special Medical Journal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was a treasure priced at 1000000 cultivation experience!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen opened his Treasure Chest and checked out Old Lord Taishang’s Special Medical Journal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang’s Special Medical Journal: Old Lord Taishang’s medical journal</span></p>
 <p><span style>Withdraw.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Do you wish to study Old Lord Taishang’s Special Medical Journal (Level 1)?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, a bunch of information flowed into Ye Zihen’s mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A call suddenly sounded out beside Ye Zichen’s ear. He looked up and saw Su Yiyun run over towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It really is you, why are you here?” Su Yiyun clapped his shoulder, causing Ye Zichen’s face to instantly turn green.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait, what?” Su Yiyun was completely confused, but he quickly saw the bandages around Ye Zichen’s shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The f*ck? Ye-zi, what happened?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You were f*cking trying to kill me, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within Ye Zichen’s ward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the ward was already full of people since his bros from the dorm, Su Yan and Xia Keke had all rushed over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How could you have a gunshot wound?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke’s delicate face frowned. As Ye Zichen looked at the caring gazes of the surrounding people, Ye Zichen glared at Su Yiyun in annoyance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This huge mouth, he didn’t dare to tell the people around him in fear of them worrying.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That’s great, now they all know.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t glare at him, why didn’t you tell me when you got so hurt?” Su Yan’s face was also full of worry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen did feel rather awkward in front of her.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Where did this awkwardness originate from?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It was their affability level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ever since Ye ZIchen saved Elder Su, Su Yan’s affability level shot up and reached 499.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes, it was just 1 point away from lovers, but no matter what, it just wouldn’t increase.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right now, they relationship was something akin to more than friendship, but not yet lovers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They liked each other, yet resisted each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wasn’t I just afraid of causing you guys to worry?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But are we not worried now?” Su Yan bit her lips and pouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the wolf pack from the dorm saw this, they instantly screamed out, “Ye-zi, I really couldn’t tell, you seriously got our goddess.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Yu walked over and nudged him, while Kang Peng and co. also looked playfully over the two people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you guys say enough?” Su Yan didn’t mind, but Xia Keke did get a bit angry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of Ye Zichen’s roommates within the ward were shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke also instantly realized that she shouldn’t have said that, so she quickly tried to cover up, “Our Susu has a really thin face, she’ll get embarrassed if you guys are like this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A cover up was a cover up. People in the room weren’t idiots…</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, the atmosphere in the room turned really strange.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment, Huang Shengmei suddenly ran into Ye Zichen’s ward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, I want to trouble you with something.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen casually took and a cigarette and lit it as he looked at the passing images behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can’t smoke.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Shengmei raised her eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded, then shrugged, “Then, as a doctor, you should properly treat patients, what sort of doctor takes a patient hostage like you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn’t take you hostage.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, even if I did agree to come with you, you still brought me away from the hospital.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen blew a smoke circle with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Shengmei pursed her lips and did not retort, “I will apologize to Auntie Ye when we get back to the hospital, and ask for punishment from the hospital.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen speechlessly twitched his mouth when he heard her serious reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He just wanted to make a joke, he didn’t expect that this Doctor Huang to be so boring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You didn’t tell me what do you want me to help you with.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen chucked the cigarette out of the window and raised his eyebrows. He only followed Huang Shengmei out without asking about anything just to escape from the awkwardness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to ask you to help treat my little brother’s sickness.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was completely stunned.</span></p>
