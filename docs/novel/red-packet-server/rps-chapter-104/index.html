 <p><span style>Chapter 104 – Guo Qiang submits</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was there any message he wanted them to bring back?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pursed his lips with a smile and shook his head, “Nope.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sunglasses-wearing man clearly did not expect Ye Zichen would give him that sort of reply. However, he still nodded and returned to the car, before driving away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fifth Bro, it’s such a great chance, why do you keep on rejecting it? I can see that Director Hu thinks that you are rather promising. He came to our school personally several times when you weren’t in school.” Zhu Yunbai, the youngest in the dorm, asked in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Yu patted his shoulders and shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Out of everyone in the dorm, he knew Ye Zichen for the longest and was the one who understood him the most.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He could faintly remember that Ye Zichen had a girlfriend in high school.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That girlfriend seemed to be Yang Yushi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sagged during the third year of high school. After that, no matter how famous Yang Yushi got, he never showed off his past with Yang Yushi at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Something might have happened in the middle, causing him to not want to mention it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhu Yunbai was stunned by Bai Yu’s hit, while Ye Zichen put away the concert tickets with a smile and a shrug.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s the point of being an artist? Isn’t it just to earn money? The thing laozi lacks least right now is money, is there a need to tire myself out to be an artist just to show off?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why do I want to hit him so much? Zhang Rui covered his right fist with his left hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Kang Peng also nodded in agreement, “He really is deserving of a beating.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They arrived at a restaurant near school as they chatted. Actually, this restaurant was decently sized, but its cost were rather valued for money, so it was always the top choice for students from the Polytechnic University.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since all of the rooms were full, Ye Zichen and co. sat down at a seat near the window on the second floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir, here is your menu!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The waitress placed the menus on the table. Ye Zichen directly pushed the menus in front of Kang Peng and Bai Yu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You two are the main characters today, order.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, the eyes of the waitress beside them suddenly brightened as she exclaimed, “You are Ye Zichen, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen scratched his face and looked up when he heard that, “Yeah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then can I take a photo with you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The waitress, who got the photo, revealed an excited expression, while Kang Peng and Bai Yu also ordered, then sent the waitress away with a wry smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Yu raised his eyebrows playfully, “Ye-zi, your reputation is no worse than a celebrity. At the very least, you are this in our Polytechnic University.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, he raised his thumb.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled wryly, “Can I interpret that as you praising me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was praising you from the start. Our Young Master Ye is super popular in Polytechnic University, even us bros manage to get something out of it,” Zhang Rui wrapped his arm around Ye Zichen’s shoulders and laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Get something out of it?” Ye Zichen revealed a look of confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhu Yunbai twitched his mouth on the side and said, “This dick used your WeChat to trick girls into getting a room with him. Did you not notice that more and more people are adding your WeChat recently?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh wow,” Ye Zichen immediately stood up from the chair and cursed while waving his fist. “So you were the person who leaked the news. Bros, what are you waiting for…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop messing around. Ouch, I was wrong, don’t…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, they didn’t use much strength, it’s just that Zhang Rui was too outrageous in his acting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, a hostile shout sounded out from the curtained room beside them, “The ones outside, calm down.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They immediately stopped, while Ye Zichen put his finger on his mouth and signaled everyone to quiet down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a public location, and they were truly too loud earlier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop messing around, do it back at the dorm if you are going to mess around.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Zhang Rui also smiled coyly and bowed towards the people downstairs apologetically. However, when Ye Zichen’s side quietened down, someone in the room laughed in disdain, “Did you see that, the grandsons out there submitted.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a hint of pride in that person’s voice, causing Ye Zichen and co.’s expression to turn sour all of a sudden.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck, who the heck said that just now? Say it again if you dare!” Zhang Rui pushed his glasses up, then stood up and shouted towards the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style> “Oh? He’s got a temper.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, the curtain to the room was pushed aside, and seven or eight teenagers holding beer bottles walked out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandson, your grandpa said this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Guo Qiang.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person that spoke up wasn’t just anyone, it was Guo Qiang, who had stolen Ye Zichen’s girlfriend.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhang Rui frowned, while everyone else at the table all stood up and picked up the beer bottles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They all knew that this grandson stole Ye Zichen’s girlfriend.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Laozi wanted to help Ol’ Five deal with you ages ago, you bastard. You are unlucky to meet me here,” Zhang Rui picked up the beer bottle and was about to throw it onto Guo Qiang’s head when Ye Zichen, who didn’t do anything as he sat beside him, suddenly raised his hand and stopped him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi,” Zhang Rui frowned, while Guo Qiang also raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Ye Zichen stood up and glanced at Guo Qiang and co.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To Ye Zichen’s surprise, the person that stood beside him this time wasn’t Yao Yue, it was a pale faced woman, who clearly put on too much make-up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you caring about him, he’s just a mad dog,” Ye Zichen snatched the beer bottle over from Zhang Rui and chucked it, and hitting Guo Qiang’s head directly. “Just directly hit him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck…” Guo Qiang’s subordinates immediately rushed over with their beer bottles, while Kang Peng and co. picked up the chairs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Guo Qiang stood up as he covered the wound on his head with his hand, then blocked off the people behind him. Afterwards, he walked in front of Ye Zichen and lowered his head, “Young Master Ye, this beer bottle is something I owe you. Now you have hit me. You can hit me, but don’t take a petty person’s fault to heart and don’t hate me. I broke up with Yao Yue, you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Qiang’s reaction shocked everyone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It also caused Ye Zichen to raise his eyebrows with a smile, “What did you call me just now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Ye!” Guo Qiang lowered his head as he clenched his teeth, “Young Master Ye, I had eyes, but no pupils then. But that bird Yao Yue isn’t any good woman either, since she could make me use money to take her away from you, she could get others to do the same.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kang Peng,” Ye Zichen raised his hand. Kang Peng immediately understood and placed a beer bottle in his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smashed the beer bottle down, causing Guo Qiang’s head to be covered in blood. However, he continued to clench his teeth and stand in front of Ye Zichen with a lowered head, “Young Master Ye. Sorry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style> “F*ck off,” Ye Zichen pointed to the stairs and cursed with a sullen expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Qiang immediately took the woman and his subordinates beside him and ran from the second floor as if he was just let off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clenched his fist firmly and sat down onto the chair silently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi…” Bai Yu and Zhang Rui patted Ye Zichen’s shoulder to comfort him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye ZIchen laughed, then thought back to Guo Qiang’s earlier words, “So funny.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen licked his lips, then took out a bottle of beer from the box beside him and laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Drink with me. Today, we’re not going back until we’re drunk.”</span></p>
