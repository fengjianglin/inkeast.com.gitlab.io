 <p><span style>Chapter 75 – Another marriage string</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Treating sickness in her little brother?!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Was there something wrong with this Huang Shengmei, she is a doctor, yet she’s telling someone who didn’t even get their vet certificate to treat her little brother.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Doctor Huang, did you drink at lunch?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A hint of sadness flashed across Huang Shengmei’s pretty eyes. She focused on driving and replied, “I know what you’re thinking, but my little brother’s sickness is a bit weird, so I can’t do anything about it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I’ll be fine?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can definitely do it if the person in the photo is truly you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Shengmei’s tone was stern and resolute. Ye Zichen also felt like he was affected but her, but he couldn’t help but say, “You really flatter me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Half an hour later, Ye Zichen arrived at Huang Shengmei’s home.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sis, you’re back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just after Huang Shengmei entered the room, a glasses-wearing boy sitting in a wheelchair</span></p>
 <p><span style>The boy looked to be around seventeen or eighteen years old, while his face was rather pale.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was Huang Shengmei’s little brother, Huang Yi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Idol.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Ye Zichen also walked into the room. Huang Yi’s eyes brightened upon seeing him, then rolled his wheelchair over in order to check him out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It really is idol. Idol, what did you come here for? Sis, he can’t be your boyfriend, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Yi’s eyes were filled with light of excitement. Ye Zichen was a bit confused by his words, while Huang Shengmei blushed and smacked him on the head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you saying? He is the person that sis brought to treat you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Idol’s gonna treat my sickness.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Yi’s expression suddenly changed. Seeing that, Huang Shengmei quickly explained, “Lil’ Yi, don’t think too much into it, he…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s great, how do I cooperate?” Contrary to Huang Shengmei’s expectations, Huang Yi actually laughed excitedly, causing her to get a bit confused by her little brother. Whenever she had brought someone to treat him before, her little brother would be very resistant to it, he had never been so cooperative.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Huang Yi cooperating with the treatment was definitely a good thing for Huang Shengmei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, I brought you here to get you to take a look. Can my little brother’s legs be treated?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at Huang Yi’s legs.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Natural paralysis.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It should be a problem that was there from when he was born.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I did get a lot of orthopedic experts to take a look, including Professor Deng Cheng, but they had no way of treating him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Find a place to lie down,” said Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To be honest, Ye Zichen suddenly felt a bit of admiration for Huang Shengmei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Yi’s situation meant that he couldn’t handle his lower body at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Shengmei had always taken care of him like that, it was worthy of respect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure!” Before Huang Shengmei spoke up, Huang YI already rolled his wheelchair back into his bedroom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Under Ye Zichen and Huang Shengmei’s help, he laid down onto the bed. Ye Zichen reached out and pressed down on a few places on the back of his waist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you feel anything?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is an indescribable feeling.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen retracted his hand after pressing down on a few more locations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How is it?” Huang Shengmei asked worriedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He can be treated, but…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But what?” Huang Shengmei couldn’t get more excited.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye ZIchen raised his hand to signal her not to be too impulsive, “He can be treated, but not now. I’ll come and see after a few days.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why does it have to be after a few days? You have to just say any request you have. As long as you can help my little brother stand up, even if you want me…” saying that, Doctor Huang abruptly stopped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen also smiled playfully, “Even if it’s you? Then what?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Shengmei did not reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye ZIchen also knew that she was impulsive just now and spoke without thinking. He shrugged and smiled, “I’m not the type of person to add insult to injury. Currently, I really can’t treat your little brother. I will naturally tell you when I can. There is no need to worry!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang’s Special Medical Journal did indeed have a way to treat her little brother. However, the way it used was different from Chinese medicine’s acupuncture or western medicine’s surgery.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He would need to use qi to treat it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just now, Ye Zichen used qi when he pressed down on Huang Yi. Sadly, he only just studied the special medical journal, so his storage of qi was not enough at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he wanted to open up all of Huang Yi’s blocked nerves, it would require a tremendous amount of qi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right now, what he had…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was merely a drizzle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sis, how did you get to know idol?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang YI laid on the bed and raised his eyebrows at Huang Shengmei after Ye Zichen left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What idol? Why don’t I understand? You’ve been calling him idol from the beginning, just what’s going on?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Shengmei asked in confusion. In response to that, Huang Yi took out his phone and opened up a video on Weibo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Listen, my idol sang it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Yi handed over the phone, while Huang Shengmei looked at the video in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Shengmei raised her eyebrows when she saw the person in it…</span></p>
 <p><span style>She didn’t find it anything special when she heard the start, she just doesn’t understand how he became her little brother’s idol.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Until…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“For our breakup, you don’t need to take…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ta-thump.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment she heard that, Huang Shengmei’s heart suddenly beat intensely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment, Ye Zichen’s singing pierced through her heart like a sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was moved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received a marriage string.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who was standing underneath Huang Shengmei’s home, was shocked. </span><i><span style>How did he get a marriage string.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He clicked open the treasure chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Possessor: Ye Zichen, Possessed: Huang Shengmei. Currently affability level: 10.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It can’t be!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen opened his eyes wide speechlessly. He didn’t do anything with Huang Shengmei, why did a marriage string appear?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Could it be that the woman really wanted to repay him with her body since he was going to treat her little brother?</span></p>
 <p><span style>But he didn’t even start on the treatment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye ZIchen rubbed his head and stopped a taxi. The moment the marriage string appeared, it meant the other person had started to have good feelings about him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the hell.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shook his head and decide to ignore the matter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where to?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“First People’s Hospital.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment he said that, Ye Zichen’s phone rang once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The caller ID was unknown. Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows when he heard the slightly sinister voice, “That’s me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your roommates are in our hands. If you don’t want anything to happen to them, then come find me at the abandoned factory in the eastern part of the city.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was completely shocked, “Why should I believe you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, don’t come…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Yu’s screams suddenly sounded out through the speaker on his phone. Not long later, a dark voice sounded out from the other end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your roommates are a bit disobedient… the abandoned factory in the eastern part of the city. Remember, come alone…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slam.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The call was hung up. Hearing the sound from his phone, Ye Zichen clenched his fist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Drive, turn around to the city east!”</span></p>
