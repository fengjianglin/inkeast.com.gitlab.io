 <p><span style>Chapter 579 – Duan Gu, who screws people over</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ridiculous!” Duan Gu’s lingering spirit howled in Ye Zichen’s consciousness, causing the latter to gulp in surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior, don’t get so worked up. You’re in my head, what if you scare me to death?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmph, I can’t believe that Duan Hai actually acted to outrageously,” Duan Gu cursed. “I told him to stay in Mount Supreme to help me choose some capable youngsters to give opportunities to. I didn’t tell him to mess with them.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Duan Hai.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>So that’s this great deity’s brother?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior, is he your brother?” Ye Zichen asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kind of. Actually, he was the artifact spirit for my protective artifact, which was what transformed into Mount Supreme. He can also be said to be the control center of Mount Supreme,” Duan Gu replied plainly, which did not hide his endless anger. “I can’t believe he actually did not listen to my words. Does he really think that nobody can do anything to him just because this old man died?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was definitely unable to make conversation when the old person was having a monologue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Child, can you do me a favor?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This junior definitely will not refuse senior’s request,” Ye Zichen promised. </span><i><span style>Perhaps this senior might tell me Duan Hai’s fatal weakness, so I can easily cripple him when I get out.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Duan Hai might have a terrible personality, but he is not bad at heart. He just learnt to love messing about from me, but what he is doing now has already twisted my wish. I want to ask you to help me wipe his memories away, and turn him into a new artifact spirit…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior, then can you tell me his weakness?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll be counting on you. My lingering spirit is about to disperse. It’s all on you now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey… Hey…” Ye Zichen looked around and shouted as he stood on the boulder, but Duan Gu’s voice did not appear again.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What on earth!?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>He gave me a mission, then went away? That’s way too irresponsible. What’s more, that Duan Hai is way too strong, he didn’t even tell me that guy’s weakness, and he actually wants me o wipe that guy’s memories clean…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>He’s insane!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Or at least tell me what do I do now.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I thought I would get to know how to pass this stage.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Who were you shouting at just now?” Xuan-Yuan Xiang asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sat directly onto the boulder, then rolled his eyes, “Guess who I bumped into?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bumped into?” Xuan-Yuan Xiang paused momentarily. “Oh, I get it now. You met the person who crafted this armor, right? It’s that great deity. So what did he tell you? More rules? Let me guess, did you have to answer questions when you put on the armor, and if you got it wrong, then its defensive capabilities are halved?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I feel like you could be Duan Hai’s family!” Ye Zichen twitched his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who’s Duan Hai?” Xuan-Yuan Xiang asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Actually, the Niflheim Dragon’s name is Duan Gu. The person setting the game rules right now is Duan Hai. He’s the artifact spirit of the former’s defensive divine artifact, and is the control center of the entirety of Mount Supreme. Just now, Duan Gu gave me a mission that is impossible for me to finish. He wants me to wipe the artifact spirit’s memories clean,” Ye Zichen said helplessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then go. As the master, he must know the weakness of his artifact spirit,” Xuan-Yuan Xiang replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But, the problem is that his spirit was about to disperse, so he told me jack shit,” Ye Zichen was speechless. “Say, what the heck am I supposed to do? Duan Hai can kill me with a single slap. Isn’t it delusional for me to even try and wipe his memories?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hehe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xuan-Yuan Xiang, who was floating in midair, suddenly giggled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen glared at her, when she finally responded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you glaring at me? It’s not like I set you the mission. But then again, you don’t have to complete the mission. He didn’t say that you’ll get killed if you don’t complete it, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He didn’t say it, but what about my friends if I don’t kill that evil artifact spirit? What’s more, I can’t even ensure that I can clear each stage successfully. I’m not the Chosen One,” Ye Zichen replied plainly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“New players have entered. The final destination of the third stage will be the Niflheim Palace. Please arrive within 48 hours. Those who are unable to do that will be killed! The countdown begins now. Good luck.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>New players!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Don’t you need the keys to enter Mount Supreme. How did these new players pop up?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s more, I have to find the Niflheim Hall now, and the countdown has already begun.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I have to hurry up and get out of this damn place,” Ye Zichen immediately stood up, then jumped down into the water.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What he should consider right then was not Duan Gu’s mission. Even if he was going to feel troubled by it, it should be after he gets out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, he has to get out as quickly as possible. Only then could he bring Xia Keke and co. over using the map.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll definitely end up passing a boss or something, right? Oh yeah, the system seems to know everything, I might as well as it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“System!” Ye Zichen held up his phone, then shouted towards it. The system didn’t care about the lack of signals, and Ye Zichen understood that he would be unable to comprehend how the system worked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: What? You shouldn’t have reached the Niflheim Hall yet. The time isn’t matching up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You even know about that?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows. “System, just what are you? Why do you know everything? Are you an oracle or can you predict the future?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: I can’t tell you about the details. What business do you have with me? You have the map, it shouldn’t be any problem for you to reach the Niflheim Hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not anxious because of that. You know about the Hell Trial of Mount Supreme, right? I don’t know how to pass that. Hurry up and tell me the secrets to passing so I can go and get Xia Keke and the rest,” Ye Zichen replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: Hell Trial? What’s that? Why don’t I remember?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The message was immediately redacted the moment it popped up. However, Ye Zichen still caught a glimpse of it.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Remember.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could the system have experienced Mount Supreme before?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But isn’t this the first time Mount Supreme activated?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: Figure the Hell Trial out yourself. I’m sure you won’t be stuck in there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, explain to me what you meant by don’t remember,” Ye Zichen asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he did not get another reply, while the system notifications begun to disappear one by one.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s going on?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen knit his eyebrows tightly together. He felt like something was amiss. However, time was passing by and he had no time to waste. He gradually sent his spiritual energy outwards, and walked forward as he remained vigilant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tap. Tap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he reached a crossroad, Ye Zichen heard a soft sound. He stopped and frowned, and listened carefully to the origins of the sound.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The right hand side!”</span></p>
