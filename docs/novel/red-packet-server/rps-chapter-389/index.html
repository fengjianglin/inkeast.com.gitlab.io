 <p><span style>Ha.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that news, Ye Zichen nearly fell over laughing. </span><i><span style>Old Lord Taishang actually wore silk stockings.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but click open the photo after a while to save the photo. </span><i><span style>This is Old Lord Taishang’s dark history, I might even be able to get something from him with this in the future.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you wearing the silk stockings?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen replied as he held back his laughter. Old Lord Taishang instantly responded with a cold expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If I don’t try it, then I wouldn’t even know how I die! Say, just what trashy thing is this? Is this something for people to wear? You actually told me to give it to the Queen Mother… You truly wanted to screw me over!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s pretty obvious that Old Lord Taishang misunderstood. Silk stockings were able to show off a woman’s beauty, and that’s why a dude like him looked extremely humorous in it.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t think so much. Giving silk stockings to the Queen Mother is definitely fine… If you don’t believe me, then you can get a fairy to wear it. It’ll definitely surprise you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen replied in good will.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Old Lord Taishang merely replied coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe… Telling me to find a fairy? This old man is already really old, so what am I finding a fairy for? I think that you don’t only want to screw me over, you want my chastity of my older years to be gone!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the hell?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just what the hell is in this geezer’s brain? </span></i><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but feel speechless when he raised the news.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can’t help you if you don’t believe me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fine, you want to admit it now, right? Fine, this old man will remember this grudge!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Smash.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang chucked his phone off to the side, while his furious look shocked his disciples.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you looking at. Hurry up and refine pills!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Seriously…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had wanted to explain himself, but when he sent the message, he noticed that the old man had already deleted him. </span><i><span style>I really don’t understand why that old man is so angry. If it really doesn’t work, then I’ll just change a treasure for him.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>The Modern Realm doesn’t have a lot of things, but it does have plenty of good treasures.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes speechlessly, then sent another friend request after letting out a long sigh.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I’ll do what I can and let fate take its course. If that old man doesn’t add me, then I really can’t help him.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Three days passed by in the blink of an eye. To Ye Zichen’s expectations, Old Lord Taishang did not accept his friend request, and instead rejected it several times with curses…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen wasn’t someone that didn’t care about all that. </span><i><span style>Since that old man doesn’t want to add me… Then I won’t bother.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Was King Chujiang messing with me? I’ve been watching around the Ghost Region every day for these three days, but why have I never seen Diting come over?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you doing? Let me go!” A childish shout sounded out beside his ear. That voice caused Ye Zichen to turn around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A young looking kid entered his view. Judging from his tattered clothes and his face, he should be a young beggar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows. Then, he saw a pig-like man patting the child’s head continuously with his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little tramp, you should open your eyes wider when you walk. Can’t you see that grandpa is walking on this road? Say, you dirtied grandpa’s clothes, how are you going to compensate… Can you even afford to compensate grandpa?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zeze….</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It is very obvious that it’s the daily actions of a rich person bullying a small fry. </span></i><span style>Ye Zichen hated seeing these kind of incidents.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I thought these situations would only happen in the Modern realm, but so the Underworld was not free of that either!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen squinted his eyes, then walked towards the pig-faced man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey… Bro!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who?” The pig-faced man frowned. Then, when he saw Ye Zichen, who was behind him. “Brat, go and stay where you should? Did you die not long ago? In the Underworld… Wait till you are a ghost servant before you try being a hero!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pig-faced man pushed Ye Zichen. Only then did Ye Zichen know that plenty of ghosts passed by, but even when they saw what happened, they pretended like they didn’t see it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You aren’t letting me advocating justice since I’m in the Underworld?” Ye Zichen frowned, then straightened his neck and nodded. “I am minding this business. What can you do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There truly are people who doesn’t know death even when it’s in front of them!” the pig-faced man squinted his eyes. Then, ten-odd muscular ghosts appeared around him. “Hitting people when doing official duty is not illegal. Treat this beating as a lesson to you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pig-faced man laughed coldly, while the buff ghosts around him walked over. However, just as they were about to make a move, they noticed that they couldn’t possibly make a move against Ye Zichen at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“C’mon, hit laozi!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stuck his neck in front of the pig-faced man’s face. He had not stayed in the Underworld doing nothing the past few days.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He read up on some laws in the Underworld. The law clearly stated that they cannot attack living people. They were allowed to trick and tease, but they were not allowed to threaten or harm living people…</span></p>
 <p><span style>It could be said that Ye Zichen was a lord in the Underworld, since the little bastards were unable to do anything to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen kicked the pig-faced man. The man held his crotch and shouted towards the buff ghosts, but there was nothing they could do.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little bastard, laozi’s going to advocating justice. Come and hit me. Hurry up and teach me a lesson!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen kicked the man once more, causing the pig-face man to instantly stop talking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Look at your grandson look.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen snorted towards the pig-faced man, then turned his head towards the child, “Alright, it’s none of your business now. Hurry up and leave. If you get oppressed, then resist. He is definitely going to bully you if you just endure it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, after he gave a bit of advice to the boy, Ye Zichen turned around to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please wait,” at that moment, the boy he had saved suddenly stopped Ye Zichen, then ran over. “Uhm… Thank you very much for helping me. I’ve seen you in the Ghost Region for several times. You seems to be searching for someone. If you don’t mind, then you can tell me. I might be able to help you find the person you’re looking for.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing the question, the boy nodded with a firm smile, “I’m not very powerful in the Underworld, but I do have my ways of finding people.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled, then when he saw the boy’s certain gaze, he decided to just try and ask the boy, since he couldn’t find Diting just by waiting for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m looking for Diting, can you tell me where he is?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Diting? Is it Lord Diting, King Ksitigarbha’s ride?” the boy revealed a look of confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled, “That’s him. What? Is that too difficult for you”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How’s that difficult,” the boy snorted happily with pride. “What’s hard about that? I’ll take you there directly!”</span></p>
