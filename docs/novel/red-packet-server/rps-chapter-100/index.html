 <p><span style>Chapter 100 – Turning the tables</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Jiayi, who was handcuffed to the heater as well could no longer make any sound as she sobbed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was looking like he just had been fished out of the water, while huge droplets of sweat fell onto the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crackle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The baton in Liu Qiang’s hands prodded Ye Zichen again, who nearly lost consciousness, causing him to shiver intensely once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qiang licked his lips and smiled savagely. He grabbed Ye Zichen’s hair and slapped him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brat, gonna get cockier?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen feebly opened his eyebrows and moved his lips. Liu Qiang revealed a playful smile, “What do you want to say?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he said that, Liu Qiang brought his ear closer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck… you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qiang hit Ye Zichen’s stomach with the baton, then squinted his eyes with a snort, “You’re still reluctant, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, he picked up the baton and walked towards Li Jiayi, “This is your woman?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qiang grabbed Li Jiayi’s chin and laughed, “Hey, if it wasn’t for her other side of the face, she would look pretty good. Especially this body. Zeze… It’s so voluptuous!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let go of me!” Li Jiayi struggled futilely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who had nearly lost consciousness, also stood up with a struggle when he saw this, “Grandson, come mess with grandpa if you dare. Grandpa isn’t scared of you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heheheheh…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Smack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately coughed up a mouthful of blood as the baton struck him once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Liu Qiang’s phone in his pocket rang. He looked at the caller ID and snorted towards Ye Zichen with a smile, “You got lucky.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he hit Ye Zichen with the baton once again and walked out of the room with his phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen…” LI Jiayi cried.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe!” Ye Zichen raised his head feebly and smiled. “Don’t be scared. That grandson… will suffer… later!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Liu Qing also floated over and reached out her hand in an attempt to support Ye Zichen’s body, “Ye Zichen, you have to hold on. My dad will come save you very quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe,” Ye Zichen smiled dumbly with squinted eyes and continuously nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Superintendent Wang.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qiang stood outside the room and answered the phone with a normal tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m asking you, did you arrest a suspect called Ye Zichen just now?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why would the superintendent mention this?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qiang’s heart jumped as he gulped, “Yeah, I did arrest someone named Ye Zichen. He is related to a smuggling case, so I…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Related my ass!” Superintendent Wang suddenly roared in the phone. “I’ll telling you, hurry up and let Ye Zichen go. The city police department has already sent someone over to get him! Also, you have to say good things to him and apologize properly, okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qiang’s hand trembled as he opened his eyes wide, and sweat appeared on his forehead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I-I understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmph,” Superintendent Wang snorted and said. “Oh yeah, you didn’t give Mr. Ye a lesson, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Giving him a lesson was exactly what he had done to Ye Zichen just now…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qiang’s heart was about to explode. He gulped and said, while clenching his teeth, “No-No…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmph, you got lucky. Otherwise, even ten lives are not enough for you! Speak properly when the person from the city police station comes over later. Alright, that’s all!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slam.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The call ended.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Beep, beep…</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, a police car parked outside the police station. Lin Xiyue, wearing a police hat, frantically ran in with three policemen in tow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiyue, why did you came here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao Ziming walked out of the office with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Xiyue frowned and said, “Ziming, did your station arrest Ye Zichen?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen? That name is so familiar!” Zhao Ziming revealed a confused expression. Then said in surprise after a long while, “Isn’t that the name of savior? I didn’t hear about anyone arresting him though?”</span></p>
 <p><span style> “Then hurry up and ask your colleagues, Ye Zichen was arrested by your guys. I came to get him out under orders,” Lin Xiyue’s face was filled with worry. She had rushed over the moment she got Commissioner Liu’s call.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although she didn’t have a good impression of Ye Zichen before, but ever since last time…</span></p>
 <p><span style>She gained a very different view of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao Ziming’s expression darkened when he felt Lin Xiyue’s worry for Ye Zichen, but he still revealed a shocked expression and said, “Alright, I’ll make the call right now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qiang went completely dumb after his call with Superintendent Wang. He sat limply on the ground, while his phone fell to the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Liu Qiang.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Zhao Ziming’s shouting sounded out beside Liu Qiang’s ear.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Captain Zhao.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Yeah, Captain Zhao told him to do everything. Captain Zhao gave him the towel and told him to do it.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He did everything under Captain Zhao’s instructions!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Captain Zhao, save me,” Liu Qiang kneeled on the floor and crawled over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing him, Zhao Ziming’s expression grew sullen, “Where is Ye Zichen?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There!” Liu Qiang pointed his finger towards the room. Seeing that, Lin Xiyue immediately ran towards it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Xiyue’s heart felt a sudden pain when she saw the devastation in the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, wake up… Ye Zichen…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She hugged Ye Zichen’s neck tightly and shouted out his name.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Liu Qiang and Zhao Ziming also walked in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they saw Lin Xiyue hug Ye Zichen, Zhao Ziming’s face grew dark once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Give me the keys,” Lin Xiyue essentially roared out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qiang took out the keys with a pale expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin XIyue quickly unlocked Ye Zichen’s handcuffs and continued to shout out Ye Zichen’s name, “Ye Zichen, wake up… wake up…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the other policemen also unlocked Li Jiayi’s handcuffs. Immediately after that, she directly ran to Ye Zichen’s side and pushed Lin Xiyue onto the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Screw off.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You dare to assault an officer!” Zhao Ziming shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“None of you are good!” Li Jjiayi glared at Zhao Ziming and roared, then she cried as she held Ye Zichen’s head. “Ye Zichen, don’t scare me, hurry and wake up… Ye Zichen…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…” Zhao Ziming’s face was dark, but Lin Xiyue held him back with a cold smile. “Zhao Ziming, look at this great team that you lead.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, she turned around to the policemen behind her and shouted, “Hurry up and call the ambulance. Also, arrest him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The policemen that Lin Xiyue brought with her immediately dialed the number for the ambulance and put Liu Qiang under control.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qiang’s entire face was filled with terror as he reached his hand out towards Zhao Ziming, “Captain Zhao, save me. This is all your…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao Ziming, who stood by the side, kicked Liu Qiang’s stomach, causing the two policemen who were putting him under control to fall onto the ground as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It really is my shame to have a teammate like you under me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Captain Zhao!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qiang still wanted to say something, but he was afraid due to Zhao Ziming’s shocking gaze.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He knew!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He no longer had the chance to turn it around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cough, cough…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Ye Zichen, who was lying in Li Jiayi’s arms suddenly coughed intensely. Lin Xiyue hurried over, but she could only watch him worriedly from afar due to Li Jiayi’s hostile gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, you’re awake,” Li Jiayi instantly replaced her cries with smiles when she saw Ye Zichen open his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha… Laozi is going to turn the tables!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was the first thing that Ye Zichen said when he opened his eyes.</span></p>
