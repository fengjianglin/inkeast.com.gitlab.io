 <p><span style>Chapter 722 – Death of Great Emperor Yonghe</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Ye Zichen heard Lorie’s shout, he turned around and slashed, generating a blade of wind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The attack was far quicker than Black Dragon and the demons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the blade of wind was about to catch up…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry, we will always remember your sacrifice,” Black Dragon grabbed Yonghe’s arm and threw the latter behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For some reason, Yonghe laughed. He did not resist and allow Black Dragon to throw him out to be a meat shield for the escaping demons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He did not even try to defend against the attack either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A brilliant spark exploded as the blade of wind hit Yonghe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon quickly turned around and bowed deeply as Yonghe was engulfed by the light, then continued on his path.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lorie wanted to continue chasing after the villains, but Ye Zichen stopped her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Leave it, we won’t catch up to them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lorie stopped in her tracks, then looked down in fear of meeting Ye Zichen’s gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had failed the mission Ye Zichen handed her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry,” Lorie bit her lips like a child who had done something wrong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen caressed her head, “How is Little Lorie in the wrong? You’ve done great.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But I let those bad guys run away,” Lorie was in a sullen mood as she worried the corners of her clothes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s not your fault,” Ye Zichen comforted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really? Then can I still eat more candy?” Lorie looked up with a blinking gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen chuckled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He gave her two vials of pills, then pinched her cheek.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yay. Hurray!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lorie skipped over to Fatty Yin to show off her prize, once again showing her innocent-like childish personality.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This girl is very strong,” Flame Emperor commented. Although Lorie didn’t consciously release any spiritual energy, Flame Emperor was still able to feel threatened by her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But she’s just too pure,” Ye Zichen chuckled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t that better than being too complicated?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was unable to deny it. Indeed. Sometimes, being pure made you far stronger than those who thought too far into things.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s too late for us to chase after Black Dragon now. They really should thank Yonghe for that.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Thinking that, the group landed in front of Great Emperor Yonghe’s corpse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the blade of wind was merely something Ye Zichen had generated casually, the strength of something generated from Xuan-Yuan Sword was not to be underestimated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taking the brunt of the attack using his defenseless body…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only spelled death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s dead.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>One could not fake their deaths in front of them, due to their strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Indeed.” Flame Emperor nodded indifferently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was the nicest he could act towards someone who had betrayed the Immortal Region.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just why did he do this? But… I guess this isn’t a bad end for him.” Qingming, one of the four Great Emperors of the Immortal Region sighed. Although they didn’t talk too much, they were still people of the same era, which made them closer to the other higher ups of the Immortal Region.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was very furious when Great Emperor Yonghe had betrayed them as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet…. For some reason, Great Emperor Qingming managed to understand why Yonghe had made the choice that he did.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They all had their own ideals. </span><i><span style>Perhaps Yonghe chose to do this to fulfill his ideals.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Seeing that he has worked hard for the Immortal Region all these years, let us bury him,” Flame Emperor said calmly. Normally speaking, if a higherup of the Immortal Region died, then they would be buried in a special ancestral hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Great Emperor Qingming had already betrayed the Immortal Region, so that was unsuitable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only thing they could do was not let his corpse rot away in the wilderness in light of his previous efforts.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Let us bury him right here.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>One hour later, they finally finished the deed. Neither Ye Zichen nor Flame Emperor thought nicely of Yonghe, while Qingming carefully toasted the grave, then set up a spiritual formation before leaving.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I hope you can accomplish your ideals in your next life!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon retreated with all the demons after running away from the valley. The alliance of the Three Realms chased after them, causing massive casualties.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many demons tried to fight back, but Black Dragon only gave then one surprising order….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Run, do not fight!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Three days of pursuit caused huge damage to the demon army.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was originally a million ferocious warriors was now in tatters. This was the most losses Black Dragon had ever suffered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fortunately, most of the elites were saved and none of the Demon Sovereigns died.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Given enough time, Black Dragon was still able to return in full force.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen…” Black Dragon clenched his teeth as he gazed in the direction of Maple City. “Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>And thus, the war ended with the victory of the Three Realms. Everyone joined in for a half-a-month-long celebration in the subdimension Gu Zichen had created.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, Ye Zichen’s group also became even livelier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The issues between the Heavenly Court and Underworld seemed to have disappeared with their cooperation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Underworld staff also ended up joining Ye Zichen’s Red Packet Server.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With new people…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Came red packets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the time period, most of what Ye Zichen did was stared at the Red Packet Server and think about catching red packets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And due to losing sleep became of that, he came up with an idea!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He would send an announcement to forbid the group members from sending red packets before bed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then send an announcement to permit them to send red packets after he wakes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for the consequence of disobeying it? Those people would be kicked out of the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen didn’t mind losing a few people with so many new ones.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If the situation was to be described in a simple phrase, it would be “red packets were everywhere”.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, Ye Zichen would could even justly ask the new members to send him a private red packet when he failed to grab anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And if they didn’t want to?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Away you go.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Due to Ye Zichen’s rights as the group admin, even the stingiest of people sent him something.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The time period brought Ye Zichen plenty of new things. It was utterly glorious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although he didn’t have much use for the treasures the little deities had sent him, the fun of snatching red packets was still amazing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the same reason why people in the Modern Realm enjoyed snatching red packets, even if they only had one cent in them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was all for fun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen did not lose himself in midst of all this. He fully understood that he had other things to take care of.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For example…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The missing ley line!</span></p>

 <p>Alright, I screwed up with time management real bad. Between the interview (which you should be able to see soon on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVfwsgGqyOWpJFwG6dpVgxg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Immortal Index's channel</a>), permanent overtime at work and family, I didn't find time to TL RPS at all (which means my&nbsp;stockpile ran out). Thus, I'm not going to be able to release any of the owed/sponsored chapters for you today. What I will be doing though is making sure that I TL at least 2 SMTM and 1 RPS chapter per day on weekdays and more on the weekends so slowly catch back up. Also, I'll be keeping count of how many RPS chapters I owe you guys so I can make it all up to you guys when I go back to Switzerland. <em>I also thought that I release Chapter 722 yesterday, but apparently, I haven't...</em></p>
 <p>Owed Chapters Count: 3 (+sponsored chapters)</p>
