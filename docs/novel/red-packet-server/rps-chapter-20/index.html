 <p><span style>Chapter 20 – Level Six Celestial Pill – &nbsp;Body Strengthening Pills</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was hard to refuse eagerness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, Ye Zichen had followed Xiao Yumei home.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Tiantian, who was watching anime on the sofa, saw Ye Zichen, she directly jumped down from the sofa.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Daddy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at Tiantian, who was hugging his leg and looking at him with a smile, completely unsure of what to do.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Making a mistake once was fine, but he was going to be in trouble if she kept on making that mistake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei also heard Tiantian’s way of addressing Ye Zichen, but this time, she didn’t correct her immediately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Auntie Tang, go back first. It’ll be fine for me to watch over Tiantian, I don’t have anything to do tonight.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fifty-something year old woman in the mansion smiled, then left the mansion after taking off her apron.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mommy, did Daddy come to see Tiantian?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm, he came to see Tiantian.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei pinched Tiantian’s cheek, while Ye Zichen stared at what had happened in front of him blankly. He didn’t understand why Xiao Yumei would reply Tiantian like that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good Tiantian, go and watch TV. Mommy has something to say to Daddy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She patted Tiantian’s head, then Tiantian very obediently ran over to the sofa.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at Xiao Yumei blankly, while she spoke up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tiantian actually has severe autism.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was momentarily confused. Xiao Yumei sighed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Actually, Tiantian is a child I adopted, she has had severe autism since a young age. She has always lacked fatherly love, so she might be desperate for a daddy. I hope you will not mind her acting like that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won’t, Tiantian is very cute. What’s more Mei-jie is so pretty. It seems like I got lucky since Tiantian calls me daddy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shook his head with a light smile. Hearing that, Xiaomei instantly blushed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, you really know what to say. That’s that. Play with Tiantian for a moment, I’ll go and cook for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, I’ll be troubling Mei-jie.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei got changed into her clothes at home and walked towards the kitchen, while Ye Zichen arrived at Tiantian’s side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was unknown why Tiantian really liked sticking with Ye Zichen, the moment he sat down, Tiantian hung on him like a koala.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Daddy…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tiantian only ever said that one word to Ye Zichen. All of a sudden, Ye Zichen felt a bit sad.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He really didn’t expect that the cute girl in front of him actually had severe autism.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mei-jie was rather pitiful, being a woman that was fighting out there alone…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen caressed Tiantian’s head slightly. Since this child needed fatherly love, then he’ll just treat it as a white lie and not expose the truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, Tiantian actually fell asleep in his arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Xiao Yumei was in the kitchen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She felt a lot of things as she watched Tiantian getting along happily with Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, Tiantian had seen a lot of men before meeting Ye Zichen, but Tiantian would stay far away from them regardless of who they were.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only Ye Zichen…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Perhaps, the heavens were pitying them, so they stuffed a man into their lives.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This man was truly far better than her ex, but…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was she really worthy of him?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei sighed slightly and suppressed the strange thoughts in her heart, then walked into the kitchen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your affability level with Xiao Yumei decreased by 5. Current affability level: 95.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The affability level dropped!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows, just what action did he do to tick off Xiao Yumei, causing her affability level with him to drop?</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter how he thought about it, Ye Zichen could not understand, so he just took out his phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He opened the WeChat group. The WeChat group was very busy twenty-four hours a day as if the deities didn’t need any rest at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The situation was completely different to the calmness when Ye Zichen had just entered the group. He couldn’t help but think silently, was this the butterfly effect of him entering?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He scrolled up through the chat history and saw that several red packets had appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were sent by Erlang Shen and Taibai Jinxing. Judging from the chat, they seemed to be playing a game of red packet sequence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: @Old Lord Taishang, send red packets!</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Old Lord, stop hiding, you got the most cultivation from this old man’s red packets. It’s your turn to send some.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Even I sent them. Don’t think about escaping, my Howling Celestial Dog is watching!</span></p>
 <p><span style>……</span></p>
 <p><span style>The deities continuously pestered Old Lord Taishang to send red packets. Without any other choice, Old Lord Taishang sent three sighing emojis.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>F*ck!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen has already been waiting for a long time, so he clicked down with his readied finger the moment the red packet appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Collected Old Lord Taishang’s red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Body Enhancing Pill x1.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What is this for?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clicked open the Treasure Chest, and saw a gold pill sitting in the square after the marriage strings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Body Enhancing Pill: Level Six Celestial Pill</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang refined it using 49 days. There are 49 per furnace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Effects: Improves bodily functions by a large margin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wow, this is good stuff.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sneaked a peek at the group, since it was a red packet sequence, then someone elsewould naturally send more. However, what made people helpless was that the luckiest person last time was the God of Thunder, who was the best at being shameless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, this red packet sequence ended there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen lost interest in the group without any red packets to snatch. He threw his phone to the side and hugged little Tiantian with both of his arms so that she could sleep more comfortably.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dinner Xiao Yumei cooked was very simple, there were three dishes and a soup.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tiantian sat in the middle of Ye Zichen and Xiao Yumei, making the scene like that of a family of three.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen could feel while they were eating that Xiao Yumei was trying to intentionally distance herself from him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After dinner, due to the drop in affability level, Ye Zichen did not think that she would tell him to stay overnight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, he wouldn’t accept it if they moved too quickly after just meeting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, thank you so much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei took Ye Zichen to the mansion entrance. There, she thanked Ye Zichen earnestly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mei-jie, you really don’t need to be so courteous.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Older sister has a request, I wonder if I can say it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei hesitated for a moment before biting her lips and speaking up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can you come to the mansion often? Tiantian seems to really like you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Xiao Yumei wanted to distance herself from Ye Zichen, she subconsciously did not want to just let Ye Zichen go like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Especially since Tiantian liked him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course it isn’t a problem. As long as TIantian wants to see me, you can find me any time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm, Tiantian is still in the room by herself, so I won’t send you off.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After saying his farewells to Xiao Yumei, Ye Zichen casually stopped a taxi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the middle of the journey, the car slowly stopped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The driver suddenly asked. At the same time, Ye Zichen also noticed that the place that the taxi stopped was not his school.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, what do you want?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do I want?” The driver laughed coldly, then opened the car door. “Get out, someone paid to buy a leg off you.”</span></p>
