 <p><span style>Chapter 135 – The Eight Immortals’ red packets</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Eight Immortals cross the ocean, each reveals their divine powers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a line that Ye Zichen had known since he was young. He had also seen plenty of tv shows about the eight immortals before they became immortal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen did hold a bit of respect and curiosity towards these deities.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most importantly…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Immortal Lady He entered the group!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>When the Eight Immortals entered the group, the more active members all started to greet them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For example…</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Am I seeing things? The Eight Immortals came.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: I, Old Pig, must join in on this as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: Wow, the Eight Immortals!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha: Wow, the Eight Immortals came.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Woof, woof, woof…</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were even some that don’t often speak that spoke out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Such as…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Gan: The Eight Immortals entering the group shocked me so much that I didn’t dare to chop trees anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chang’e: You finally stopped chopping trees. It was so annoying that I couldn’t sleep. Cough, cough, welcome, Eight Immortals.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Barefoot Immortal: The Eight Immortals, you guys finally arrived.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It might have be because the people in the group were too passionate, but the Eight Immortals did not dare to speak up after entering the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, Ye Zichen could only feel anxious, so he directly cleared the crowd…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cough, cough, I can understand that all my celestial friends are very excited that the Eight Immortals entered the group, but it’s too much. Look at how you guys scared the Eight Immortals to the point that they don’t dare to speak.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Wow, the Sky Sovereign appeared!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: Idol!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha: Sky Sovereign, you’re here too.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Gang: Isn’t this that great deity?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chang’e: Greetings to the Sky Sovereign.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The atmosphere in the group immediately changed when Ye Zichen spoke up. He scratched his nose awkwardly, then sent another message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cough, cough, pay attention to the main point! Let’s welcome the Eight Immortals to speak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Iron Crutch Li: Err… We finally get a chance to speak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lü Dongbin: Hello, everyone!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Sword god.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who was holding the phone, became extremely excited. Lü Dongbin, who held the title of the Master of Pure Yang, had always been his idol when Ye Zichen was younger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, the reason why Ye Zichen had such a deep impression of him was still because of the sentence…</span></p>
 <p><span style>A dog biting Lü Dongbin, unable to recognize good will.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortal Lady He: Hello.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: Hello, Immortal Lady He! &lt;insert a row of lecherous emojis&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Canopy Marshal, you have been exposed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chang’e: This guy is unable to move due to seeing Immortal Lady he.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Why do I smell jealousy…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Gang: Who dares to speak of my goddess!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: @Chang’e, my heart only has you, not her…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Caihe: Have the relationships in the Heavenly Court been so complicated recently?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Xiangzi: Yeah.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Watching the deities chat was rather interesting, but why didn’t they talk about proper matters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>New people entering the group had to give out red packets!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The heck use was chitchatting, red packets are the real deal, alright?</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seems like he still had to rely on himself to change the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cough, cough, stop chitchatting. New people that entered the group should send red packets.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who exactly is this great deity?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In a certain secret location of the Celestial Realm, Iron Crutch Li held a wine gourd and nudged Lü Dongbin, who was wearing white clothes a carrying a celestial sword on his back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re asking me, but how am I supposed to know? However, that deity seemed to be rather popular in the Heavenly Court, could he be newly ascended?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think that’s possible.” Elder Zhang Guo came over. “We know the old deities in the Heavenly Court, this new person might really have ascended recently, while we’re not in the Heavenly Court.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then should we send it or not…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course we should,” Lan Caihe squinted his eyes and smiled. “No matter what, we can’t break the customs. Am I right, Immortal Lady?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have no opinion!” Immortal Lady He stroked her hair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then let’s go,” Han Zhangli finally decided.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cough, cough, don’t fret celestial friend. We’ll send it right now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Iron Crutch Li was the clear spokesperson for the Eight Immortals, so he would speak always be the first to speak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment he said that, a bunch of red packets appeared with a ring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was fully focused on the screen as he waited to snatch red packets, the moment they appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t believe that the internet speed of 4G could be slow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But he never could have imagined…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What the hell!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was completely dumbfounded by the sudden appearance of a wave of red packets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Who’s should he snatch?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had wanted to get Immortal Lady He’s, but after a long while, he couldn’t find it, causing him to waste all his time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He’ll just click whichever one he sees!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unfortunately, no matter which one he clicked on, they had already been snatched away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: Haha, I, Old Pig, got 4.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Just passing by, I got 6.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: I got seven.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Gang: Heh, 1!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chang’e: 3!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen wanted to cry as the deities showed off how many red packets they got.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t get a single one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the people at a nearby bus stop saw Ye Zichen, who was sitting on the flowerbed, alternate between excitement and depression, they all moved far away from him as if he was mentally ill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Liu Qing also sat beside him and comforted him, “Don’t be unhappy, deities are definitely better than us mortals at snatching red packets.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can I be happy?” Ye Zichen sighed. These were red packets from deities, especially when they’re from the Eight Immortals…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He might have gotten some sort of treasure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s most important was Immortal Lady He’s red packet, if he was lucky, he might be able to get a Nine Heart Lotus Root, so it would save him a lot of trouble.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if this was just him trying to get lucky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm, aren’t you really amazing in the Heavenly Court! You can ask them for private envelopes, we have so many delicious and fun things, just exchange it with them!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing floated behind Ye Zichen and put her hands on his shoulders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but chuckle when he heard her words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This little girl, after he’s been with her for so long, she has already udnerstood most of his ideas.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he thought of the fact that she wouldn’t always be with him like this every day after she gets revived, he really was a bit reluctant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How about not reviving her…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Ye Zichen had the idea, he quickly shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He must revive Liu Qing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Buzz…</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, the phone in his pocket rang. Ye Zichen took his phone out and had a look at the caller ID.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty Bai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fatty Bai, what is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Dahai, who sat within his office behind locked doors, paced around his office several times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He finally spoke after ensuring that there were no surveillance cameras or recording devices.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Ye, Hao Wen just contacted me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled, it seemed like this fatty has decided to follow him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have decided to come over completely?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Dahai, who stood within the office, gulped. He did struggle several times in order to make this decision.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Ye, can you promise to save my wife and daughter?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fatty Bai, are you doubting my abilities?” Ye Zichen pursed his lips with a smile. “If you want to follow me, then I can promise to try my very best to save them. If you don’t, then it doesn’t seem like Hao Wen would let them go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Basically, Ye Zichen’s words had one meaning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You have no choice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, I will follow Young Master Ye!” Fatty Bai also understood that Ye Zichen was right. “Just now, Hao Wen told me to start preparing, he’s getting ready to make the move.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen squinted his eyes upon hearing that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, keep cooperating with him. Leave the rest to me.”</span></p>
