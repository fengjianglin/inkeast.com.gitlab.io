 <p><span style>Chapter 729 – King Qinguang turned as well</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Qinguang was very troubled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The job of staying till the end was tough and yet he had to do it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t really that big of a deal as he was the eldest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s how he had always comforted himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet… When he finally finished the task and sent everyone over to the Heavenly Court’s group… And when he finally entered the group…</span></p>
 <p><span style>In less than three minutes…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was out again!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He thought long and hard about it but just couldn’t accept it. He really didn’t want to try and get into that shitty chat group again, but all his brothers convinced him otherwise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So… He decided to enter again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for how? He naturally had to go and find the person who kicked him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master, would it be possible for you to add me to the group?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why should I?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Qinguang was utterly speechless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uhm.. We are old friends, you really can’t treat me like this, can you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heavenly King Li fought beside me and we went through life and death, but I still kicked him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, a screenshot appeared on the screen. It was one where Ye Zichen kicked Heavenly King Li out of the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master, you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t try to talk about relationships. The rules of the group require everyone to send red packets when you enter. You didn’t send any in time, so you were kicked out. I didn’t decide on the rule myself, all the other deities agreed on creating that rule.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen replied bluntly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Qinguang gritted his teeth. “I’ll send them!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s too late.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m done with this shitty group!” King Qinguang stomped in feet in anger. </span><i><span style>What the hell! No matter what, I </span></i><b><i>am</i></b><i><span style> a reputed person of the Underworld!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>This is just too much!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, I’m telling you guys now. I’m not going to join the group.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Qinguang complained in the private group of the Ten Yama Kings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang: Big Brother, calm down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Lunhui: Be more rational.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Pingdeng: Don’t be so impulsive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m being impulsive? Look at what he said to me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He sent a few screenshots in the group. The group instantly turned silent for a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then…</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang: Big Brother, I think Master is right.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re helping outsiders now?” King Qinguang was clearly displeased.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Yanluo: Master did put everything too bluntly, but he is still being logical. You didn’t send any red packets, that’s why you got kicked out of the group. It was the same when we entered the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Pingdeng: Old Chu didn’t send any like you back then, so he got kicked. He had to pay a hefty price to re-enter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s just a shitty group, why do you care about it so much!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang: The upper echelons have decreed that all information will be sent through that group. If you aren’t in the group, then you will end up behind on the news. You should understand what’s at stake, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Lunhui: The group is also used for socializing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So that means I have to????”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A few “mhmm” appeared on the screen. King Qinguang could only give up. Although he was unhappy about it, he still had to enter the group. He couldn’t bear the consequences of being behind on the news.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Fine. Worst come to worst, I’ll just give more up!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>King Qinguang thought to himself, then sent a message to Ye Zichen, who was actually having fun chatting with Old Li.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You said the Jade Emperor snuck down half a month ago, then came back around half a day later? Then he never came out since?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even a radically loyal person towards the Jade Emperor like Heavenly King Li ended up falling under the combination of threat and reward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. We have not seen the Jade Emperor in the past two weeks. It’s also been a long while since we have had morning court.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see,” Ye Zichen pursed his lips with a smile. “Alright, your information has been very useful for me. You can re-enter the group now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Heavenly King Li received a message that he was added back into Red Packet Server.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King Li has joined the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: Wow, Old Li’s back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: This is good.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King Li has been set as an admin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: Old Li got promoted!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Barefoot Immortal: There’s definitely more to this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen (Admin): He’s actually equal to me now!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Gang: It must be some disgusting deals!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Gang was removed from the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Heavenly King Li will be an admin of the group in the future too, please support him. As for Wu Gang, treat it as some nice benefits. Make good use of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon, a bunch of smirking emojis appeared in the group. They understood very well…</span></p>
 <p><span style>That there will be more red packets to grab.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Heavenly King Li did not say anything in the group yet. He didn’t care so much about being an admin, what ultimately brought him over was…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, about the wedding anniversary present…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I definitely did not forget,” Ye Zichen smiled. “Go to Yue Lao and ask him for a three carat diamond ring. It’s a new product that we haven’t launched yet, I’m sure it’ll be a great choice as a present for your wife.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“New product?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Heavenly King Li’s eyes lit up. All women liked to have things that belonged only to them and his wife was no exception.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t think so much of it when he heard that it was a diamond ring, but when he heard that it was a new product…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, thank you so much!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Work hard for me in the future. I won’t let you down.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, yes, of course.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After finishing his deals with Heavenly King Li, Ye Zichen turned to see King Qinguang’s message.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wow, putting him on hold for a while is amazing. The sheer number of messages really shows how desperate he is.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Ye Zichen maintained the cold attitude, King Qinguang did not dare to retort anymore.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s good as long as he replies!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He was truly worried that Ye Zichen would never let him back into the group when Ye Zichen didn’t reply earlier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He did not say anything and merely sent a red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smirked.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He’s smart.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, he did not open it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, why didn’t you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Qinguang was truly anxious. </span><i><span style>Hurry up and receive it. Then I can get into the group!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s been nearly two minutes, but he didn’t do anything!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could Sky Sovereign think that it is too little?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You want to enter the group?” Ye Zichen sent a simple question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s simple.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pasted the conditions he gave Heavenly King Li, then changed the terms a little.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tell me the latest news on your boss. Not only will I let you back into the group, I’ll let you be an admin. What’s more, you can also have a hundred thousand cultivation experience worth of credits to purchase from the Heavenly Court. How about that? Do I need to give you some time to consider?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Erm…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Qinguang was rather hesitant. </span><i><span style>I really shouldn’t sell my boss out...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Two hundred thousand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I really can’t…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Five hundred thousand. Consider it carefully. You will be getting essentially five hundred thousand cultivation experience and the esteemed identity of an admin in the group. If you are still going to refuse, then don’t think about coming back in.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But he’s our boss. I’ve been working for him for…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A million.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Deal!”</span></p>
