 <p><span style>Chapter 188 – Fully Gathering the Fragments of Soul Pearl Yiyuan</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Oh wow.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The leader of the Underworld’s Ten Yama King’s added him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Back when he chatted with King Qinguang, the other person had used King Chujiang’s phone. Now the actual person had added him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled, then accepted the friend request.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Intimacy Level: 100. Friendly!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was different from when he accepted the friend requests from those from the Heavenly Court. King Qinguang did not react at all for the three full minutes that Ye Zichen waited after accepting the friend quest.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Was the Underworld so busy?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen thought about it for a moment, then sent a testing message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“King Qinguang?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment King Qinguang, who was sitting on his throne and listening to a song, saw that his phone vibrated, he picked up his phone to look at the message, then quickly replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He replied.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is King Qinguang seeking me out for!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A red packet suddenly appeared on the screen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One who is unaccountably solicitous is hiding evil intentions!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He sent a red packet without having said much…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Whatever, I’ll collect it first.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>You received King Qinguang’s red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fragment of Soul Pearl Yiyuan x1</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen instantly stood up in the car, causing him to hit his head against the roof of the car.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Laddie, what are you doing?” The driver asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately smiled coyly, “Sorry, I got too excited!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Someone scored in a match, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The uncle shook his head with a smile, then ignored him. At this moment, Ye Zichen also sat back down in the backseat as he rubbed his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, it’s hurting you so much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing popped out from an unknown time. From the sounds of it, she probably saw the scene earlier.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This chick doesn’t have a conscience.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I only got so excited for her!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes at her in annoyance, then opened the Treasure Chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He finally gathered all six fragments of Soul Pearl Yiyuan!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Would you like to fuse the Fragments of Soul Pearl Yiyuan?</span></p>
 <p><span style>No.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen refused it without thinking. He wasn’t at home, if any weird situations appeared when he fused it, such as a lightning tribulation or something…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Isn’t that what happens in xuanhuan cultivation novels!?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It wasn’t better to believe that it’s real. After all, what if it really occurs!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, now that he gathered all of the Fragments of Soul Pearl Yiyuan, it definitely was a great thing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not only was he past the hardest step of Liu Qing’s revival, this treasure was a treasure that the Yellow Emperor used back when he battled Chiyou…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many deities desired this item.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I never would have thought that it would end up in my hands!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen hid the excitement in his heart with great difficulty, then exited the Treasure Chest after a few deep breaths.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Qinguang had sent him many messages after sending the red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Qinguang: Master, this is the fragment that you have been asking for.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Qinguang: I had to say a lot of good words to Kshitigarbha to get this fragment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Qinguang: Master?</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Qinguang said all this in order to gain a bit of favor with Ye Zichen, and the latter wasn’t someone that didn’t understand how relationships were.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will remember this favor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Qinguang, who was in one of the halls of the underworld, smiled in satisfaction. Since he received that reply, it was no loss for him to ask for the fragment from Kshitigarbha.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since I have sent the fragment over, then I won’t take up too much of master’s time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“See you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but take a few more glances within the Treasure Chest after saying farewell to King Qinguang.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Fragment of Soul Pearl Yiyuan!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Completely gathered!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, damn pervert, there seems to be someone following us outside!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment, Liu Qing slapped him with her hand, and pointed out the back window of the car.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen turned his head back. He could only see some cars from the back window, and was unable to notice anyone there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, he looked towards Liu Qing with a confused expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing bit her lips, “I really saw it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why didn’t I see it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The driver didn’t think anything much of Ye Zichen’s sudden words.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The young man was just leaving a voice message on WeChat!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It was normal.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I really saw it! Why don’t you believe me!?” Liu Qing pouted with a slightly troubled expression. “I saw a long haired man just now. His face looked extremely vicious, he was following right behind our car!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A person instantly came to Ye Zichen’s mind.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Yu.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you certain that you didn’t make a mistake?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn’t!” Liu Qing answered with certainty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Leave it, wait till I get out of the car.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the taxi reached the destination, Ye Zichen got off the car with Liu Qing in tow, as she looked around.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>If it really was Yu, then what did he come for!?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>To kill me?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Then why didn’t he make a move in the jewelry store? Was he afraid of causing a commotion?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But how did he find me? Could he have been following me from the start!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Thinking that, Ye Zichen felt goosebumps crawl all over his arm…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He surveyed the surroundings vigilantly. The taxi stopped at the entrance of the compound, and there was quite a distance from the entrance to the door to the apartment…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen chose to only walk on paths where the lights shone as he remained extremely vigilant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shasha!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A noise suddenly sounded out near the vegetation, causing Ye Zichen to yank Liu Qing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Enter the Dragon Eye.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can help you,” Liu Qing offered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen reached up and patted her head, “The other person isn’t normal, hurry up and go in.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright,” Liu Qing answered depressingly and returned to the Dragon Eye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen licked his lips and pretended to be calm, “Yu, come out, I know it's you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shhh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A man in black tight-skinned clothes jumped out from the vegetation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked over.</span><i><span style> It was indeed Yu!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You are very vigilant!” Yu’s tone remained emotionless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled, “I can’t live long if I’m not vigilant. What did you come here for? To kill me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the first time Ye Zichen had been in this sort of situation. The other person had said that they were aiming for his life so bluntly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Especially since he couldn’t beat the other person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To be honest, he was truly a bit worried.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen licked his lips and laughed softly, “Can you tell me the reason?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mr. Huo told me to kill you. I have a request of him. Sorry!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Yu revealed his edge like a drawn sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu flashed like a black shadow. When Ye Zichen managed to react, Yu had already gotten in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled to the side in a disorderly manner, but Yu’s second attack had already caught up to him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It was only at that very moment that Ye Zichen truly felt the difference between him and Yu.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It was like a huge valley!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Forget about the ability to counter attack, when up against Yu, he couldn’t even evade.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A loud roar suddenly sounded out in the silent compound. Ye Zichen looked over and saw Third Fatty Jin run over in a jiggly manner, wearing only a pair of trunks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu, who was just about to succeed, looked towards Third Fatty Jin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he frowned, forcefully retracted his hand, then disappeared from the compound with a few leaps.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ba-thump.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ba-thump.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was truly freaked out. If it wasn’t for Third Fatty Jin coming right on time, he would have to go play chess with King Qinguang…</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Yu was strange as well. He was about to succeed, but then he ran away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, are you alright?” Third Fatty Jin look towards the direction Yu disappeared in with a frown, while helping Ye Zichen up from the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen collapsed on Third Fatty Jin, he was truly freaked out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fatty, I have to note down this achievement,” Ye Zichen panted heavily, then patted his shoulder. “Why did you suddenly run out!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Di Tian said that you were in danger, so he told me to come and get you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen revealed an expression of surprise!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Di Tian… You said Di Tian told you to come and get me?”</span></p>
