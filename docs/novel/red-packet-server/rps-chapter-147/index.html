 <p><span style>Chapter 147 – I, Old Sun, have arrived</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s expression turned even darker when he felt two girls’ determination to stop him from entering the mansion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other two girls, who were beaten by him until they couldn’t stand properly, also stood up from the ground with a struggle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the looks of it, they were going to prevent him from entering with their lives.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are your lives not the most important thing in your eyes?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen squinted his eyes. As time ticked away, he also became more and more anxious.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>If this continues…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I gave you guys a chance, but you didn’t take it. Then don’t blame me for ruining a flower.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clenched his fist and decided to stop holding back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you standing there muttering there for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blackie stood on the side of the window on the second floor of the supermarket, while Zhuge Kongming closed his eyes as light shimmered around his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop disturbing me,” Zhuge Kongming frowned and did not open his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His right thumb continuously tapped the tips of the different fingers, and continuously muttered incomprehensible words like the daoists in ancient times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A light flashed across Zhuge Kongming’s eyes, causing his eyebrows to knit together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Threatening, but not dangerous. Yet, the fortune telling displayed it as great danger.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? Blackie was completely confused when he heard this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Zhuge Kongming jumped down from the bed, “Tell me Zichen-ge’s position.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How should I know?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aren’t you his…” said Zhuge Kongming, before realizing that he ripped the Ghost Controlling Sigil down the other day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He slapped his thigh and clenched his teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heaven’s Eye, Open.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A silver vertical eye, just like Erlang Shen, Yang Jian’s, third eye appeared on his forehead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blackie was completely shocked, causing him to gulp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, Zhuge Kongming opened his eyes once again and snorted, “Di Tian, this piece of trash… Blackie, come, let’s go to save Zichen-ge.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The clock ticked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Di Tian, who saw on the sofa, smiled. Then, he snapped while putting down his wine glass.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Times up. Do it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His feminine smile caused people to shudder, while Xia Keke and Su Yan got a bit worried. No matter how strong they acted, it was impossible for them to not be afraid when a knife was on their face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ta.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ta.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ta,</span></p>
 <p><span style>The slow, yet clear sound of footsteps rang out from the mansion’s living room. Ye Zichen slowly walked towards Di Tian as he drug Hao Wen expressionlessly by the collar with his right hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were several shocking wounds on his chest that blood slowly flowed down from.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he ignored them and remained expressionless…</span></p>
 <p><span style>And continued to walk forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen casually threw Hao Wen in front of Di Tian. Ye Zichen had never met him before, but he could be sure that the person in front of him was Di Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is the person you wanted, now let my people go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Riche Bro.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan and Xia Keke screamed out when they saw his heart-breaking wounds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen turned around and smiled towards then. Then, he turned back towards Di Tian after giving them a reassuring gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Very good, very strong.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Di Tian clapped his hands and stood up from the sofa.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wasn’t very tall, and only reached Ye Zichen’s shoulders when he stood up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked down at Hao Wen, who was beside his feet, then looked up and took a glance at the two women who were controlling Su Yan and Xia Keke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck off.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen lifted his leg and hooked Hao Wen, then chucked him onto the two women.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immediately after that, he grabbed hold of Di Tian’s collar and lifted him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandson, what do you want?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let go of Young Master.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shhh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two men and two women suddenly appeared beside Ye Zichen. All four of them held sharp daggers in their hands, as they pointed it on two fatal spots.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen continued to hold Di Tian by his collar and said coldly, as if he didn’t hear anything, “I already brought the person over to you. You said it on the phone that I was going to exchange Hao Wen for the two of them. Do you want to go back on your words?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But I wanted someone alive.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Di Tian’s eyes glanced over Ye Zichen like a viper. Ye Zichen pushed Di Tian away and looked at Hao Wen, who was lying on the ground without moving, then laughed coldly, “I can cure him and bring him back alive.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need,” Di Tian shrugged with a smile. “I was going to take his life after you brought him over. Now, it saved me some effort.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then… Let them go,” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, DI Tian shrugged with a smile, then brought his ponytail to the front and looked at Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry, I place an importance in a deal. You lack the chips for the trade, so it cannot be done. I’ll be taking these two girls.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen knocked the four people surrounding him away, then clawed at Di Tian with his right hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“False Spiritual Body, do you really think that you’re invincible?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Di Tian reached out with a mere two fingers and blocked off Ye Zichen’s attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, he raised his leg and kicked Ye Zichen’s chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The chest, which was already wounded, started to continuously bleed after the kick.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen squatted down in the living room of the mansion with a pale face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man in front of him was very strong, he was so much stronger than the delinquents he had met before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most importantly, False Spiritual Body.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the hell did that mean!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen did not have that much time to think. He immediately applied some force into his legs and dashed towards Di Tian. He must deal with this man, then bring Su Yan and Xia Keke away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regardless of how many he tried, he still felt like he was ramming into a wall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, never mind…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan shook her head helplessly. Every time Ye Zichen dashed forward and got smacked back, she felt really pained in her heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke, who was on the side, already turned silent, but a faint golden shimmer could be seen in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Di Tian!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A roar sounded out in the living room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen disregarded the bloodstains and pain on his body, and dashed madly towards Di Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, Di Tian did not send him flying…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Di Tian dislocated Ye Zichen’s right arm, then flipped his right hand, and used his left leg to push Ye Zichen’s back, forcing his head onto the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I said more than once that I don’t like a person that comes off too strong. Most importantly, I’m someone that means what I say. I’m taking these two girls, so you can’t bring them away, do you understand?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Di Tian, I’m going to kill…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Di Tian stepped forcefully onto Ye Zichen’s leg, while squinting his eyes, before laughing beside Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think you’re seeking death.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha… Di Tian, I’m going to kill…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You won’t have a chance.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Di Tian’s right hand emitted a faint light as he smacked towards the back of Ye Zichen’s head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke shouted loudly, while the golden color in her eyes became more obvious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, at that moment, a faint figure suddenly appeared in the mansion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, I, Old Sun, have finally arrived!”</span></p>
