 <p><span style>Chapter 122 – Inciting Defection</span></p>
 <p><span style>A grey Mercedes, followed by three black Jettas appeared in everyone’s sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The eyes of Bai Yang, who was laying on the floor, brightened, as he scrambled to get in front of the Mercedes door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ten-odd trained man, wearing black short-sleeved shorts walked down from the Jettas with bats in their hands, while a middle-aged fatty walked over from the Mercedes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dad.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Yang immediately sobbed when he saw the middle-aged fatty. The fatty looked at his fingers, causing his oily face to darken.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who did this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dad, it’s that brat…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Yang resisted the pain from his fingers and pointed towards Ye Zichen, who was sitting at the supermarket entrance.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Grandson, let’s see how you’re going to run.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Yang thought fiercely in his heart, while Zhuge Kongming pursed his lips and stood in front of Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Ye Zichen smiled playfully, “You’re Bai Yang’s father?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The middle-aged fatty’s shoulders trembled when he heard this. He slowly looked up and saw Ye Zichen raising his eyebrows with a faint smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, if you don’t want to die, then hurry up and kowtow to your grandpa and otherwise. Otherwise, you’re in for a treat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Yang shouted out first. He had even more of a grudge against to Ye Zichen compared to before.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Stole his woman, and dared to hit him!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Dad, kill this brat…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The middle-aged fatty slapped Bai Yang. The strength of the slow was actually enough to cause Bai Yang to spin around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry up and apologize to Young Master Ye.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Yang covered his face without understanding anything. The hulks, who got down from the Jetta were also confused, causing them to be unsure of what to do with their bats.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen slowly walked over with a warm smile. The fatty quickly dipped his head, and pressed Bai Yang’s head down with his right hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bai Dahai, you got a good son.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sweat instantly flowed from Bai Dahai’s forehead. Ye Zichen gave a cue towards Zhuge Kongming with his eye, who brought out a packet for tissue from the supermarket and threw it in front of Fatty Bai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wipe yourself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you, Young Master Ye,” Fatty Bai answered respectfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Yang, who was on the side, glared and cursed, “Dad, this grandson is nothing at all! I investigated him, he’s just a poor student, why…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty Bai kicked Bai Yang out of annoyance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This son of his was too retarded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He acted like this, could his son still not tell?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dad…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t talk to me, go and apologize to Young Master Ye,” Fatty Bai shouted with a red neck. He clearly knew how fierce Ye Zichen could be, and deadly were Ye Zichen’s actions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He only did that in order to allow his son to stay alive, but this son…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need,” Ye Zichen shook his head with a smile and pointed towards Bai Yang’s fingers. “I suggest you to get someone to quickly send him to the hospital and fix his fingers. As for you, I do want to have a chat with you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Ye…” Bai Dahai didn’t know what this meant, but Ye Zichen had already returned to the supermarket.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He squinted his eyes and licked his lips, then walked into the supermarket by himself after indicating to the people he brought to take Bai Yang to the hospital.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are no chairs in the supermarket, so stand,” Ye Zichen opened his eyes and said, as he sat at the cash register.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Dahai looked around the room when he entered, and hearing Ye Zichen’s words, he quickly nodded, “No problem, my waist isn’t good, so standing is better.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe…” Ye Zichen chuckled, then tapped onto the table. “Do you know why I intentionally got you to come here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No,” Bai Dahai shook his head with a dry smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Actually, I’ve always been surprised, why was Director Bai able to give me the jewelry store you worked hard for during half of your life without any hesitation?” Ye Zichen squinted his eyes and lit a cigarette. “Even if I managed to grab most of the ores, and you not getting any jade will cause your jewelry store’s reputation to go down and your revenue to decrease… It seems like you could still hold on.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty Bai, who stood on the side, rolled his green-pea-sized eyes, “Young Master Ye is correct, but I’m getting old, and no longer lack the motivation of young people. If I work with Young Master Ye, although the jewelry store is no longer mine, my earnings as the second largest shareholder would be even higher than when I worked by myself. Businessmen do it for money!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye ZIchen had already slammed down on the table and stood up before Fatty Bai even finished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That slam terrorized Fatty Bai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bai Dahai, you still don’t want to tell me the truth, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>More and more beads of sweat appeared on Bai Dahai’s face, he couldn’t spare any effort to wipe away the sweat on his face anymore, and merely allowed them to flow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was tense, and his heart beat rapidly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t be so nervous.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Ye Zichen stood up once again and took out a few tissues to hand to Bai Dahai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry up and wipe. Look at your sweat, you should lose some weight.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Ye is right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty Bai clearly became very timid when he said this. He said softly after swiping the sweat from his face, “Young Master Ye, my disrespectful son has offended you. Allow me to apologize to you on his behalf.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Fatty Bai bowed deeply towards Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young people are often rash,” Ye Zichen smiled as if he was very understanding, while Fatty Bai also smiled coyly and nodded in response. “However.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gulp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Ye, what exactly do you want to say, just say it directly,” Fatty Bai’s heart was about to explode, he didn’t know what Ye Zichen wanted to speak to him about at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He really didn’t know whether he would go crazy if he continued to suffer at Ye Zichen’s hands like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since you said that, then I’ll satisfy you,” Ye Zichen instantly retracted his playful smile. He directly took out a folder of information from underneath the cash register and threw it onto Bai Dahai. “Have a look.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Dahai opened it in confusion, but when he saw the photo on the first page…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Ye, I’m innocent!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Dahai kneeled onto the floor as he proclaimed his innocence, while his pupils contracted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen squinted his eyes, then leaned back on his chair, “Stop pretending. I know everything.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Ye…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know that your wife and daughter are in Hao Wen’s hands. You only cooperated with him with no other choice, but… I can help you get your wife and daughter back from him. Do you know what you should do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Dahai, who was kneeling on the floor, suddenly stood up and said with red eyes and a serious expression, “Young Master Ye, what do you want to do. I’ll fully cooperate with you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do I want?” Ye Zichen pursed his lips and smiled. “Before that, tell me about your’s and Hao Wen’s plan.”</span></p>
