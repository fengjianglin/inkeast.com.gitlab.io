 <p><span style>Chapter 41 – Testing</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Hai stood in front of the car door. They had already arrived at the Xiao family some time ago, but Ye Zichen just refused to get out of the car.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Ye, get out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You know that this is kidnapping, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen refused to come out of the car with a tsundere-look. He had already said that he wouldn’t come, but Xiao Hai ended up just directly throwing him in the car and brought him here.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is this the attitude they should have towards their savior?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He had saved the old man’s life. It’s fine if they’re not courteous, but they actually used violence against him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Even a mud doll would get mad.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, I had heard that Lil’ Ye came.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A clear laughter sounded out from outside the door. Xiao Hai turned around in surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandpa, why did you come out?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The old man walked towards the car.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who had been lying in the car like a big boss also sat up. It was fine for him to put on an air in front of Xiao Hai, since they were of the same generation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t dare to do it in front of the old man of the Xiao family.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Man Xiao.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stood respectfully in front of the old man. Old Man Xiao chuckled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So this is Lil’ Ye. Not bad, he looks talented.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Man exaggerated his praise.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen replied courteously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, don’t be so courteous. You saved my life, so you are my savior,” Old Man Xiao chuckled brightly. “Since you came, then come inside.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the second time Ye Zichen had come to the Xiao family home.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even so, he couldn’t help but be shocked about how luxurious the Xiao family was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had a huge courtyard, which was the size of the mansion he had bought.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After entering the living room of the mansion, he saw a pot of Longjing Tea on the tea table with three tea cups.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Man Xiao pointed to a seat on the sofa, signalling Ye Zichen to sit down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Ye, to be truthful, I, this old man, really am thankful towards you. I had thought that I would have to spend the rest of my life on a sickbed. I didn’t think that…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Man Xiao’s tone was full of feelings. Ye Zichen was only able to smile awkwardly in response.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He really didn’t know how to handle this sort of elder, who had lived for a long time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Hai, who was extremely mighty on the outside, also sat beside Ye Zichen like an obedient child, not daring to even utter a single world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, the atmosphere in the living room seemed a bit awkward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Ye.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!” Ye Zichen immediately sat straight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I heard Lil’ Hai say that the pill you saved me was a pill called the Great Recovery Pill,” When Old Man Xiao mentioned this, a light flashed across his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes,” Ye Zichen nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I wonder Lil’ Ye’s parents…” Old Man Xiao said, then shook his head with a smile. “Sorry, Old Man, I, asked too much. This is Lil’ Ye’s secret. I have no right to pry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe…” Ye Zichen chuckled dumbly. For some reason, he felt like this old fellow was not as harmless as he seemed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To be fair, how could someone that could establish such a large corporation be a normal person?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Ye, I wonder if you still have any more of that pill?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Man Xiao spoke up once again. When Ye Zichen heard that, he instantly tensed up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t think too much. I just want to ask my old friend for medicine. He’s about the same as me, he has quite a bit of issues since he’s old.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Man, pardon my helplessness.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen revealed a helpless smile. He did have more Great Recovery Pills on hand, but he wasn’t an idiot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This old fellow clearly felt something unusual. If say anything idiotically at the time, he was unsure of what might happen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chief Liu had asked him weirdly before, whether he was someone from there!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He did not know where “there” is.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since it was unknown, it meant danger. It was better for him not to get into contact with it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Such a shame.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Man Xiao shook his head, then rubbed his temples.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Hai, accompany Lil’ Ye here for a moment, I’m going to rest a bit in my room. I’m old now, so my body’s not well. I can’t even sit properly for a long time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandpa, take care.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Man Xiao returned to his room under the support of a servant. Then, Xiao Hai smiled at Ye Zichen apologetically.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Ye, don’t think too much into it. My grandpa’s like that. He likes to think too much about people after staying in the business world for so long. However, believe that he has a good heart, he definitely will not force you to do something or secretly investigate you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Hai explained for Old Man Xiao, while Ye Zichen also nodded with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, then sit here for a moment, I’ll go and tell the kitchen to prepare dinner.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Xiao Hai had left, Ye Zichen became the only person in the living room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only at that moment did he let out a long sigh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Man Xiao likes to think too much into people, but wasn’t Xiao Hai the same?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both of them ran businesses, so they would have the issue of businessmen, causing them to always try to guess what other people are thinking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen felt that he should come less into contact with businessmen, otherwise, his deities’ chat group might be found out about one day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Hai, what do you think about Lil’ Ye.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Hai did not go to organize dinner, instead, he went to Old Man Xiao’s room. If Ye Zichen found out about this, he would definitely get pissed off and directly leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandpa, Lil’ Ye is my good little bro. Can you not look at him like you view business enemies?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Hai was a bit angry. However, Old Man Xiao slammed down on the table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Foolish.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Hai instantly dipped his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We, who run businesses, rely on thinking about other people’s thoughts in order to advance far. This Ye Zichen has a mysterious background. If you don’t fully understand his background, how are you supposed to be real friends with him. What’s more, I think Lil’ Ye doesn’t treat you sincerely either,”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandpa, can you not view Lil’ Ye with eyes of an older person? He’s different from other people.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Hai still wanted to argue, but then gave up when he remembered Old Man Xiao’s stubbornness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Never mind. No need for this dinner. I don’t want to pry into what Lil’ Ye was thinking, nor do I want to know if he can treat me sincerely. What’s more, don’t you think that Lil’ Ye is really like one of your old friends?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandpa Gu.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Xiao Hai finished, Old Man Xiao fell deep into his thoughts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandpa, think about before. It was because you like to think too much into people that Grandpa Gu left, aren’t I right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How dare you!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ugh.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Old Man Xiao, who was sitting on the chair, suddenly coughed up a mouthful of blood and fell onto the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After staying in the living room for a long time, Ye Zichen found the living room to be a bit sinister and terrifying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t dare to take out his phone to look at the group chat. God knows if there’s any security cameras in the mansion spying on him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong, dong, dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Urgent footsteps came down from the stairs to the second floor. Ye Zichen raised his head, then saw Xiao Hai run towards him anxiously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Ye Zichen was a bit confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Hai had left from the door, but he didn’t see him enter once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>How did he come down from the second floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hai-ge, shouldn’t you explain it to me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s expression was sullen, while Xiao Hai grabbed hold of his arm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll explain to you later. Lil’ Ye, save our family’s old man first.”</span></p>
