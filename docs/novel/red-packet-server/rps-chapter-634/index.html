 <p><span style>Chapter 634 – Shattering the Dream</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled wryly in the ward with tears gushing out of his eyes. The girls in the surrounding also wept with Xia Keke, all of them crying very loudly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you so much for going through this life with me. I really am… very happy,” Ye Zichen choked out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei pursed her lips with a smile, then grab hold of Ye Zichen’s hand. “We all feel the same.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All the girls nodded. Seeing that, Ye Zichen slowly closed his eyes. Even though he knew from the very beginning that this was all a dream…</span></p>
 <p><span style>And that the end of the dream meant death… But, honestly…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had no regrets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Beep…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The graph on the vital signs monitor turned flat. Everyone in the room also cried loudly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s soul floated out of his body in mid-air, but at that very moment…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You really want to report in at the Underworld?” A white-robed man suddenly appeared beside him and sat cross-legged in the air. “This is just too irresponsible. You felt good in the dream, but shouldn’t you consider the feelings of other people? Su Yan, Xiao Yumei and the rest are all waiting for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why’re you in my dream?” Ye Zichen glared at the man in the air, then couldn’t help but roll his eyes. “What’s wrong with you? You ruined such a nice dream. Isn’t this ending nice? I pass away peacefully in front of my children, grandchildren and the people I love. Your appearance ruined everything.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry, sorry,” the white-robed man gestured his apology, then waved, causing the scene in front of them to be reduced to nothing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Ye Zichen watched the people in front of him disappear with a hint of reminiscence, he let out a long sigh, then sat cross-legged in the void.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you come to save me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kind of,” the white-robed man shrugged. “The main reason was because I was worried that you would pussy out, so I came to check in on you. That’s when I saw that you actually did pussy out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m following the way of life. This is my respects for the dream he showed me. You don’t get shit,” Ye Zichen twitched his mouth, then raised his eyebrows. “Oh yeah, what the heck was that chocolate you gave me? I nearly died. Also, why did I get two more pairs of wings?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How would I know?” the white-robed man rolled his eyes. “I have no time to waste with you. Hurry up and shatter this dream, otherwise, all of the citizens in the city will die because of you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What should I do?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Easy, the dream will shatter as long as you feel pain,” with that, a small dagger appeared in the white-robed man’s hand, which he thrust towards Ye Zichen’s bottom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“OUCH...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s over,” Youmuu watched as the last embers of Ye Zichens’ lifeforce disappeared, then chuckled in disdain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he looked at the other people. Most of them were unable to escape the fate of death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, he could care less about them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was on them whether they could survive or not.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The eyepatch appeared on his eye once more, while his hair returned to its normal length. Just as he put on his Six Realms Patroller uniform and was about to leave…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vroom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s extinguished lifeforce seemed to lit up once more and this time, it burned even livelier than before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My butt, my butt…” Ye Zichen jumped up from the ground and held his butt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youmuu turned around and saw Ye Zichen, who was jumping around in pain…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You actually…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yo, I’m back,” Ye Zichen laughed with a wave. “Long time, no see. Oh yeah, thanks for your dream. I liked it a lot.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How could you…” Youmuu’s eyes were filled with shock. He had used seventy percent of his full power to create that dream.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even a normal Earth Supreme expert would lose themselves in it and eventually die.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Surprising? You can’t believe it?” Ye Zichen chuckled idiotically. “There’s more!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, he looked up and shocked, “Hey, how should I shatter this dream? Oh, okay. I just need to hack it with the sword, right? Got it… Alright, stop blabbering, I know what to do.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are you talking to?” Youmuu frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, I’m talking to a ghost,” Ye Zichen bit through the skin of his finger, causing another two-meter long broadsword to appear in his hands once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen gripped it tightly with both hands, then spun around…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shatter!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The darkness surrounding the city shattered, while Youmuu coughed up a mouthful of blood. He looked at Ye Zichen, who wore a mocking smile on his face, in complete shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zezeze, do you feel that I’m like super strong? No need to say it, I know,” Ye Zichen laughed ridiculously, then began to wiggle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youmuu’s expression darkened. A mid-stage Sky Immortal had actually escaped from his illusions, and shattered the dream field…</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Too embarrassing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are seeking death!” Youmuu sprinted towards Ye Zichen and shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ bro, save me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ bro… Are you talking about me?” a figure appeared in front of Ye Zichen awkwardly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing the white-robed man, Ye Zichen let out a long sigh of relief, “Yeah, of course it’s you. I’ll leave this guy to you. I’ll check up on the others.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The white-robed man rubbed his nose, while Youmuu stopped in his tracks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the white-robed man didn’t do anything, he still seemed to create an indescribable amount of pressure for Youmuu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Six Realms Patroller’s duty is to search for talented individuals throughout the Six Realms, and bring them to the Four Direction Palace to study in order to eliminate the remaining demon scum in the Upper Three Realms. Am I correct!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How’d you know?” Youmuu was shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“At the same time, the God Realm has forbid the Six Realms Patroller to use any strength above an Earth Supreme’s. Correct!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then you broke the rules,” the white-robed man pursed his lips with a chuckle. “The dream you inflicted just now use divine energy surpassing that of an Earth Supreme’s. You can still stop yourself and return to ask for punishment. You </span><i><span style>might </span></i><span style>actually be able to escape death.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What a joke,” Youmuu snorted. “Who are you to taught to me like that. You seem to be from the Upper Three Realms as well. Have you not heard of us, the Niflheim!?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course I’ve heard of the descendants of the Twelve Liches, but </span><i><span style>you… </span></i><span style>are just from a side branch, aren’t you?” the white-robed man mocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are challenging my bottom line here,” Youmuu frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So what? You can’t match me,” the white-robed man emitted clear confidence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youmuu gritted his teeth and clenched his fist…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Youmuu, stand idle!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment, a rainbow seemed to end in front of them, and on top of that rainbow bridge…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Stood a sweet-looking girl.</span></p>
 <p></p>

 <p></p>
 <p>Tick tock. Tick tock. Tick tock.</p>
 <p>Time was ticking away. I could feel my own life force draining away... Su Yan, Xiao Yumei, Xia Keke, Lu Lu... It was great seeing all of you again. Even if it was just a dream. Even if it was all fake, at&nbsp;least I got to spend a lifetime with you.</p>
 <p>I know this is all fake, but yet... I don't want to wake up from this. People might call me weak,&nbsp;call me foolish, but... This is what I want. Although it is just a dream,&nbsp;it is as real as I want it to be. I...</p>
 <p>"Hey, you just going to die like that?"</p>
 <p>Huh? Who's speaking to me?</p>
 <p>"C'mon, you can't be serious about this. You know this is&nbsp;all fake. So just wake the f*ck up."</p>
 <p>Oh, it's that guy. Why did he have to appear?</p>
 <p>"Why did I appear? I just wanted to check into see if you died or not. Thank the lord I came. If I came any later, you would have died off for good."</p>
 <p>Ugh, this bastard. Now everything's ruined!</p>
 <p>"You really want to just leave like this? You'll be leaving Xiao Yumei, Xia Keke, Su Yan and Lu Lu behind you know? What are they going to think? How will they feel if they know that you died? Have you considered that? Don't be so selfish."</p>
 <p>I-I really want to punch him. G|oddamnit. Fine, since he's here, I&nbsp;can't exactly pretend that this was all real and meant to be either. Gah, I guess its time to wake up.</p>
