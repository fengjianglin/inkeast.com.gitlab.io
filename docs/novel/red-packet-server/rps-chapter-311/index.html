 <p><span style>Chapter 311 – The Cute Criminals</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the criminals in the cabin were stunned by the incident, and when the man got closer, Ye Zichen finally managed to recognize that the man was the slightly retarded fatty who sat beside him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fatty’s forehead was covered in sweat, while the woman on his shoulders continuously struggled in his grasp, kicking as much as she could.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, help!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone in the room were shocked by the call. Then, several people with the same clothes as the criminals in the cabin also followed him out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Capture that fatty, the mission target is on his shoulders.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, the criminals in the cabin immediately raised their guns, causing the ones chasing after the fatty to shout, “Don’t f*cking shoot, actually go and capture him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the fatty was very fat, he was an agile fatty. With several turns, he was able to avoid the criminals easily, all the while running to Ye Zichen’s side and throwing the girl on his shoulders into the seat…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro!” He panted heavily and collapsed on the floor as he pointed at the criminals. “Help!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How would I know… Didn’t you say that there are plenty of cute girls on the plane? I went to chat them up. This is the one I got interested in, but then a bunch of guys with guns suddenly appeared. F*ck… They’re here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hand the person over to us, and we can pretend like nothing happened!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was very hard for Ye Zichen to imagine that these criminals did not immediately rush over to grab the person, and instead asked for the person to be handed over very politely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No!” Hearing that, fatty turned around and glared at the criminal. “You guys dare to take laozi’s girl as well? Laozi will kill you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll kill you!” the criminal pointed a gun at fatty’s head, but the fatty did not show any signs of fear on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was stunned by this. </span><i><span style>Am I supposed to call the fatty brave or idiotic? Damn, the gun is pointed at his head and he’s not afraid at all.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you think I, Lord Fatty, is gutless? When Lord Fatty was playing with guns, you weren’t even f*cking born yet! Don’t use a shitty toy gun to scare me, f*ck off. Otherwise, Lord Fatty’s going to slap your ass around!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment the fatty finished, the eyes of the criminals twitched, and even their hands holding the guns shook.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Another criminal patted his companion’s hand, “Don’t use a gun!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, a shimmering dagger slid out from his sleeve. It was clear that that criminal was an expert with knives, since the dagger continuously spun around in his hand as if it had a soul.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Not using a gun when they had one, and instead he chose to use a knife…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>This is rather thought-provoking.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>The security wouldn’t make a mistake. They were definitely unable to bring guns onto the plane. However, knives were kind of possible…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Then it became rather apparent that their guns were truly fake like fatty had said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop showing off, be careful of slicing your hand!” the Fatty couldn’t help but retort.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You f*cking speak too much,” the criminal kicked the fatty and pointed the dagger towards him. “If you bullshit anymore, then I’ll kill you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He pressed the dagger against the fatty’s neck, causing the latter to immediately shut up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, he tried to drag the fatty to the side, only to discover that the fatty was a bit too heavy, so he was unable to do so.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gimme a hand!” the criminal shouted to his companions. The nearby criminals immediately walked over to help, but they found that they could not drag him away either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck, did this grandson grow up eating fodder!” One of the criminals cursed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fatty immediately spoke up in response, “You’re the one who grew up eating f*cking fodder. No, you grew up eating dog food… You’re retarded like a dumb dog. You don’t even know what you’re doing as a criminal and you want to fight over a person with your Lord Fatty!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re still bullshitting!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The criminal pushed the dagger up against the fatty’s neck once more…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fatty immediately shut up again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen did notice something. </span><i><span style>Although these criminals spoke rather fiercely, they did not have any intentions to kill.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>From the very beginning, they merely threatened people, and did not act like murderous criminals!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>These criminals…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but shake his head with a smile and recall the name they announced in the cabin!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Great Thieves Big Babol.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Big Babol?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>How about Doublemint!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Do they think that they’re gum?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But thinking about that, these criminals are kind of cute.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, help!” the fatty who was being dragged by the criminals shouted out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, the other criminals immediately squinted their eyes and threatened, “Brat, sit there and don’t move. This doesn’t have anything to do with you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I feel the same. You guys better kill this fatty. This grandson was just f*cking annoying me the moment I got on the plane. Hurry up and kill him! Just kill him! Also, take this woman away if you want. Just make sure the pilot keeps piloting the plane, I’m in a hurry!” Ye Zichen said impatiently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The girl was stunned as she stared at him meaningfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you looking at me for? Do I know you?” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes towards her, then ignored her. Instead, he cursed at the criminals, “Can you hijackers respect your job more? Don’t you all have guns? Just shoot this fatty! Since you already hijacked the plane, how can it be intimidating if you don’t kill someone? What’s more, plane hijacking was a serious crime. If you get caught, then it would at least be a lifelong sentence in jail!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You said that there’s police on the plane?” At this moment, a man with a scar on his face walked over and asked with a countryside accent. “Bro, it’s mah first time hijacking a plane. Why didn’t I see police on here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is this guy retarded?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stared at the criminals, who stopped what they were doing and looked at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s no police on the plane!” Ye Zichen replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then you were f*ckign lying to laozi!” The scar-face cursed. “If there’s no police, then why are you f*cking scaring laozi? I nearly pissed myself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But doesn’t the plane need to land? Do you think it can just keep flying in the sky?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh yeah, that’s right!” the scar-face suddenly hit himself on the head. “Thank you so much, I didn’t even think of that. Bro, how should we thank you? It’s our first time doing this… We don’t know anything!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the hell was with these criminals!?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Are they the criminals, or am I? They actually didn’t sort everything out beforehand, and instead boarded the plane to ask a guest on the plane!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, Ye Zichen was extremely worried.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you guys know how to pilot a plane?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How is it possible? We all know how to drive tractors, and we’re damn good at that,” the scar-face said rather proudly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then who’s in control of the plane? Where’s the pilot?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They-They got kicked to the side. No one’s controlling the plane right now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sent the scar-face flying with a kick.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck you, do you want to die!?”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Original Chapter Teaser:</b>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Can someone tell me just what the f*ck is going on?</p>
 <p>Plane hijacking? Like... Is this a joke? This is my first time on a plane, and this is the kind of stuff I get myself into? Ugh, being the reincarnation of the Yellow Emperor is truly tough. This is probably one of those "tribulation" things again, otherwise, such a coincidence could never have happened.</p>
 <p>Man, I really hate this. I just want to go to the capital as quickly as possible!</p>
 <p>Also, what on earth is the damn fatty doing? This is a plane hijacking. Does he not understand, this is a goddamn PLANE HIJACKING! And he's standing out so much! The fact that he even came back over here and spoke to me is terrible in this situation. Is he trying to drag me into the mess that he caused in the first place?</p>
 <p>This fatty is truly nothing but trouble. Oh yeah, since the hijackers have guns, maybe they'll just shoot him dead? Haha. But no, that's terrible. Regardless of how annoying the fatty is, he's still a human being, and he's never done anything too terrible to me. If anything severe does happen, I guess I'll stick my hand in if I can...</p>
