 <p><span style>“The mist has not yet dispersed, if we just descend like this, then it will not be beneficial for us,” Yonghe couldn’t help but remind Black Dragon when he heard the latter’s urgent tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the past hour, he gradually noticed that there seems to be more to the mist above the valley than he had first expected. If it was merely the wind barrier, then the mist should have already dispersed judging from its density.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, the mist above the valley did not seem to change. That was why he realized something was wrong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The ley line has surfaced, I have no time to waste,” Black Dragon’s tone was beyond urgent. The ley line he has waited ten thousand years for has already surfaced. He already tossed the idea of caution behind him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>There is no need to consider so much. Any amount of danger will be worth it when I get the ley line.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“But…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No buts,” Black Dragon angrily interrupted Great Emperor Yonghe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yonghe sighed softly when he saw Black Dragon’s bloodshot eyes, then turned silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter what, he was just an outsider. If he spoke too much and displeased Black Dragon, it would not be good for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He has already betrayed the Three Realms, the demons were the only home left for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Black Dragon refused to listen to his advice, he could only be more careful and</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dragon roar in the valley became even louder the spark of gold light seemed to burst through the mist and into the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon couldn’t endure it any longer. He gritted his teeth and looked down at the misty Valley of Death, then charged down without saying anything more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They’re coming,” Fatty Yin saw the movements and turned to Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let them in. We’ll catch them like catching a fly in a web,” then, he smiled. “Lorie, do as you wish later. No need to hold back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay. But remember, I need reimbursement for this,” Lorie pouted with her cute little mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shook his head with a smile, then took out a few dozen vials of pills and chucked them to Lorie, “Here’s the down payment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lorie’s face lit up. She happily put the pills into her spatial sack, then skipped into the Mirage Formation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty Yin also performed a few incantation gestures and activated the formation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Ye Zichen also mentioned both Yang Jian and Nezha in the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a simple message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Begin.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian, who was eating a fruit, stood up from his chair, while Nezha also wiped his hands. They looked at each other with smiles, “We’re finally going to do something.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What should I do? They’ve treated me so nicely for so long. Now I kind of feel like I shouldn’t hit them,” Nezha pouted as he muttered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian smacked his head, “You serious? Didn’t my bro give you so much better things to eat? Stop being an idiot. We’re got important stuff to do.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Yang Jian took out a small and delicate pagoda from his pocket and muttered a few words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A few seconds later, nearly ten thousand energetic heavenly soldiers came out of the tower and stood in the air with their weapons ready.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the servant girl, who has been taking care of Yang Jian and Nezha walked in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her mouth opened wide in shock when she saw the heavenly soldiers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good girl, pretend like you didn’t see anything, got it? Now, have a good rest,” Yang Jian swept his hand across her face. She instantly fell into his arms. Yang Jian placed her in a relatively safe location, then donned his own armor and shouted at the heavenly soldiers in the air. “Warriors, expel our foes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>All Black Dragon could see after he charged down into the valley was mist. Not long later, the demon sovereigns also arrived by his side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>None of them dared to make any reckless movements when they saw the dense mist around them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yonghe!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m here,” the stout Yonghe wobbled over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon asked, “What’s going on?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My Lord, this subordinate doesn’t know,” Yonghe shook his head as he looked around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The mist wasn’t very dense, but the visibility of the area was very low. Even with his cultivation strength at the peak of the Sky Immortal level, he could only see less than half a meter away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was very different to how the Valley of Death normally is.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t know?” Black Dragon was a bit angered. Then, he said anxiously. “How could you not know as someone of the Immortal Region? Are you deliberately hiding something?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon nearly lost his ability to reason due to his anxiousness. The spiritual energy in his body radiate outwards, causing even the demon sovereigns to feel a bit suffocated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yonghe had actually wanted to wait for the mist to disperse before coming down, but Black Dragon refused to listen.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Now he’s blaming me for it!? </span></i><span style>Great Emperor Yonghe snorted, “Does Lord Black Dragon want to deal with me here? If you want to, then please, I do want to see how strong you are.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What a joke.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As one of the Great Emperors of the Immortal Region, he wasn’t afraid of Black Dragon at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, with the mist that limited even his sight to only half a meters in front of him as as cover, he really didn’t think that Black Dragon would be able to kill him there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fine…” Just as Black Dragon was about to attack Great Emperor Yonghe…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who kicked me!?” one of the demon sovereigns cursed. &nbsp;“Was it you? I near you had a thing against me, and now you actually dared to kick me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The demon sovereign turned back with a kick. The one behind him was completely stunned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But… both of them were demon sovereigns, he naturally could not endure this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You actually dared to kick me!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right, I’m kicking you. What? If you can’t accept this, then fight me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You guys are seeking death!” Black Dragon frowned when he noticed that the two were about to start fighting. “Stop right now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two demon sovereigns immediately stopped. They could ignore everyone else, but they still had a lot to fear from Black Dragon, who was their leader.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is not somewhere for you to fight amongst yourselves. There is something wrong here, so stay concentrated.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before he finished, a clear slap sounded out in the crowd.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W-Who slapped me!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who kicked me!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh, which pervert hit my ass!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who the heck is pulling my hair!?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck, my clothes are on fire!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The demon sovereigns begun to exclaim one by one. It was truly too strange of a situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hah,” a sound of laughter sounded out not far away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon looked around vigilantly with squinted eyes, “Who’s there!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did the demon sovereigns realize that someone else was there along with them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They quickly turned more vigilant and looked around, only to hear a lazy chuckle. “Damn, I was noticed. But it’s alright. Welcome to my world.”</span></p>
