 <p><span style>Chapter 568 – Yang Jian and the Great Sage’s Friendship was Exposed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master,” Mu Chengtian’s lackey hurried over worriedly. “Young Master, are you alright? Are you hurt anywhere? Let me help you up, the ground is cold and dirty, your body…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Move aside, I can get up myself,” Mu Chengtian pushed his lackey away, then struggled to stand up several times, before finally reaching his hand out to the lackey.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen and co. were completely speechless. </span><i><span style>Just how weak is he to be unable to even stand up by himself?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Even Bian Tianrui looked at him as if he was looking at a monster, as he muttered silently to himself…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is this ally actually okay!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Brat, you’ve got guts!” Mu Chengtian roared angrily and pointed towards Ye Zichen after he got up. Meanwhile, his lackey squatted behind him and tried to get the dirt off his clothes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you know who I really am? You actually dared to hit me! I can blow you over with a sneeze, and you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Achoo,” At that moment, Jail King suddenly sneezed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chengtian’s body wobbled a bit, then fell back to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master, what happened? Young Master!” The lackey squatted on the ground and sobbed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chengtian glared at his lackey, “I’m not dead. Hurry up and pull me up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is this grandson made out of paper? How did you end up in an engagement with him?” Ye Zichen pointed incredulously at Mu Chengtian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Mo glanced at Mu Chengtian and snorted, “It’s all thanks to some people’s intentions.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, she looked towards Zuo Hongxin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Hongxin smiled when he noticed her gaze, “My darling niece, why are you looking at second uncle like that? Your dad agreed with this wedding arrangement as well. Are you trying to say second uncle had a reason for setting that up? Regardless, this is a good marriage. After you get married to Young Master Mu, then the position of the Treasure Tower will only become more secure.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then why didn’t you tell your darling daughter to marry him?” Zuo Mo laughed. “What use is all this bullshit?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was clear that Zuo Mo was truly angry. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have used any profanity.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I don’t blame her. Even I feel like this brat is weird. Even a sneeze caused him to fall over! He’s definitely made of paper!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chengtian stood up once again with his lackey’s support.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Achoo!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian also sneezed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chengtian wobbled, but his lackey supported him in time, “Are you guys having fun messing with me!? You truly are daring!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, a gust of wind blew pass. Mu Chengtian, who couldn’t even withstand a sneeze, naturally could not stand still in the wind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within seconds, he fell onto the ground like a piece of paper blowing in the winds, then was pushed back quite a ways.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master, why did you run again?” Seeing that, the lackey immediately followed him with a sob.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, nobody retorted. They merely looked towards the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoosh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Three figures descended from the sky, each with a young person beside them. However, what surprised them was that although the young man in the middle was of human form, the two girls carried beastmen-like features.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ram clan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tiger clan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man in human form had eyes as sinister and poisonous like that of a…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Snake clan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the looks of it, all of them were local half-beastmen. What’s more, the three elders by their sides carried a suffocating aura amongst them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was worth noting was that Mount Supreme clearly had a barrier which suppressed spiritual energy around it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite that, they still emitted a chilling pressure, which only went to note how strong they are.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yao Emperor!” Yang Jian yanked Ye Zichen aside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The three elders looked towards Yang Jian, “War God!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So the three Yao Emperors came as well? Are you also interested in Mount Supreme?” Yang Jian smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only female amongst the Yao Emperors replied, “Didn’t War God come as well? How could we not be interested in what even interests the Heavenly Court? But War God, there is no need to be so vigilant, we won’t be able to enter.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, she walked in front of Ye Zichen, “Key.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you asking me for a key?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman nodded, “You have the most keys, and only Human Immortal leveled people or below can enter Mount Supreme. Having so many keys is a waste, so how about selling one to us?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Only Human Immortals and below can enter?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes,” the muscular man nodded. “I see that you only need three keys, so sell us one please!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>His attitude is quite good. At least he didn’t come and try to snatch the key off us just because he’s strong.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at the people around him, and saw Yang Jian nod towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can’t be certain whether what you said is true. When Mount Supreme activates, if is it true that only Human Immortals and below can enter, then I can give you guys one. If not…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then we’ll leave with our juniors,” the only women amongst the three Yao Emperors smiled.” War God and the Great Sage are always together. We don’t dare to fight both at the same time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded. The three immediately took their juniors to a place not that far away from Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How did you get to know them?” Ye Zichen asked Yang Jian quietly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I fought them before, but I didn’t win or lose. The main thing was that monkey said he was tired halfway in the middle, so he went back to Mount Huaguo,” Yang Jian yammered in annoyance. “But the three of them are very strong. They can be counted amongst the strongest in the Three Realms.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then are we really going to sell them a key later?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sell it,” Yang Jian raised his eyebrows. “The three of them have been strong for a long time. Isn’t it better for you to use a key in exchange for some treasures? What’s more, they think the monkey’s here, so they’re very wary of us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha. Oh yeah, they said that you and the monkey are always together. You really do get along!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk, I’ll never be done with the monkey!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Yang Jian and Ye Zichen chatted with smiles, Bian Tianrui frowned. He could tell very clearly that the situation was becoming worse for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Hongxin said no more either. He was no fool, and could naturally tell that the situation favored Ye Zichen’s side more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Which grandson actually caused such a large wind, you nearly blew me apart…” Mu Chengtian walked over with his lackey, but before he could finish what he said…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmph,” The female Yao Emperor snorted, causing Mu Chengtian to be blown away again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master, why are you flying again?” the lackey chased after him with a sob once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, the female Yao Emperor also stood up and raised his eyebrows, “What are you guys waiting for? Why aren’t you opening the gate!?”</span></p>
