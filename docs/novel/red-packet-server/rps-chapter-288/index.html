 <p><span style>Chapter 288 – Establishing One’s Own Power</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Ye Zichen drove Mother Ye and co. back home, both Mother Ye and Mu Jinglei smelled the gory smell in the air, and saw the bloodstains on the floorboards alongside Lil’ White in the car, and the blood on Ye Zichen…</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, both of them chose not to ask Ye Zichen what had happened, nor did they ask why Lil’ White was present.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they finally got back to the mansion, Mu Jinglei took Tiantian for a bath with a look of exhaustion, while Mother Ye sat on the sofa and occasionally looked at Ye Zichen as if she wanted to say something.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mom, is there something you want to ask me?” Ye Zichen, who had noticed all that, raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Rong hesitated for a moment, then smiled, “Nothing, it’s getting late, get some rest!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Rong turned around and returned to her bedroom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Ye Zichen gazed at his mother’s back, he felt like she truly did want to say something, but yet she couldn’t…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shook his head, then went to the bathroom for a bath to wash off the blood after Mu Jinglei came out of the bathroom with Tiantian, before he decided to go back to his room to sleep.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The next day…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen-gege!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke wore an orange T-shirt with skinny jeans as she revealed the beauty of youth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Waiting for such a school beauty definitely a luxurious thing, but some male students immediately twitched their mouth when they heard Xia Keke’s call…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk, him again!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As these students had already experienced everything from feeling envious to getting used to it all after witnessing the power of the School Beauty Harvester, they would only retort in their hearts to make themselves feel better.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why is she here?” The moment Xia Keke arrived at the school gates, she immediately pointed unhappily with a frown at Lu Lu, who had her arms wrapped around Ye Zichen’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, don’t be so stingy!” Lu Lu stuck her tongue out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s heart shook when he saw this. It was very hard for him to imagine the cute girl in front of him was actually the Ice Empress, who chilled the entirety of the Three Realms…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What stingy? Why are you sticking to Ye Zichen all the time?” Xia Keke frowned, then immediately hugged Ye Zichen’s other arm, then made a face towards Lu Lu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Ye Zichen felt rather helpless that the two girls were fighting over him, he pulled his arms away and shrugged, “Stop messing around, we have proper business to discuss.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She’s coming as well?” Xia Keke pointed at Lu Lu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded, “Don’t mind it so much. You’ve contacted Wei Chen already, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then let’s talk about it when we get there!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At a teahouse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, Xia Keke and Lu Lu sat on the second floor of the teahouse. The two girls sat on either side of Ye Zichen and hugged both of his arms without backing down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wei Chen, who sat opposite them, smiled awkwardly, “Uhm… What did you call me here for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since Keke is here as well, I’ll say it directly,” Ye Zichen squinted his eyes. “I want you to work for me from now on!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…” Wei Chen remained silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke blinked, then tilted her head at Ye Zichen, “Why do you need him to work for you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to establish my own force,” Ye Zichen said candidly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the events of the previous day, he had begun to notice the importance of his own power even more. Since the future path was filled with thorns, he might as well start paving the way for himself right now…</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was just like doing your prep work before fighting a boss in a game.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Establishing your own force?” Xia Keke was shocked. “Did you run into some sort of trouble?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just small ones,” Ye Zichen smiled. “Although these small troubles haven’t disturbed me too much, they did make me realize how puny I am. In order to strengthen myself and protect the people around me, I need a force that I can use however I see fit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If it’s like that, then I support you!” Xia Keke nodded with a giggle, then pointed at Wei Chen. “From now on, you’re Zichen-ge’s subordinate! But you still have to call me Big Sis whenever you see me, do you understand?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood, Big Sis Keke,” Wei Chen replied speechlessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was truly unable to retort. </span><i><span style>Just when did I fall to the point of having to be someone else’s subordinate?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>And this time, my boss has even changed!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>No matter what, I’m still…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But then again, I’m under the Yellow Emperor this time, so it’s not as bad as before.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Ye, please take care of me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ll take care of each other,” Ye Zichen smiled. “Oh yeah, what sort of level are the several tens of people you have at?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They aren’t particularly strong. Just False Spiritual Body level and Spiritual Body level. There’s two at the False Earth Immortal level including me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The existence of two at the False Earth Immortal level did make Ye Zichen rather happy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded in satisfaction, “You’re my people from now on, so you naturally can’t be as carefree as before. I need you to establish an information gathering group to gather information from all realms. Also, hire more people. Don’t mind their level at the beginning, only start limiting it later. There’s also no need to worry about funding, I’ll take care of that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem, as long as Boss Ye gives us enough money, I can definitely help you organize everything properly,” Wei Chen smiled. “But we do need a meeting point if we want to re-organize everything like Boss Ye said and my casino isn’t suitable…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Wei Chen made it that obvious, Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows, then glanced at the teahouse around him, “What do you think about this teahouse?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two hours later, Ye Zichen managed to buy the teahouse from its owner at a price that was fifty percent above market price.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The decisiveness in Ye Zichen’s actions shocked Wei Chen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After they sent the original owner of the teahouse away, Ye Zichen slammed the contract onto the table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“From now on, this Leisure Home is our meeting point!” With that, Ye Zichen took out his chequebook and wrote a twenty million yuan cheque that he handed to Wei Chen. “This is preliminary funding. Ask me for more if it's not enough!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke had told him that Wei Chen was definitely trustworthy.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Don’t doubt people you use, don’t use people you doubt.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Since Xia Keke had said that, Ye Zichen naturally categorized Wei Chen under the trustworthy role and handed everything to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they left from the teahouse, Xia Keke’s and Lu Lu’s desires coincided once in a blue moon as they yammered about going shopping.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen heard that the ladies were going shopping, he was truly scared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as he wondered about how to escape it, he looked up and saw Yu appear ten meters or so in front of him with lifeless eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Ye.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I remember, I remember, we’ll go right now,” Ye Zichen gave a cue to Yu, then smiled wryly at the two girls. “It seems like I can’t go shopping with you two since there’s stuff for me to do!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen waved towards Yu and left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke and Lu Lu, who were left behind, met each other’s gaze, then rolled their eyes simultaneously before turning to depart in different directions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you suddenly seek me out for?” Ye Zichen said as held a cigarette leisurely in his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment, a dagger shimmering with cold light suddenly appeared in his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“To kill you!”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Original Chapter Teaser:</b>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>So the Yellow Emperor wants to talk.</p>
 <p>Has he finally decided to build his own power? I wonder... If he has and it has time to grow, it'll truly be a terrifying force to reckon with. Perhaps, one day it would be a force that can topple the Three Realms.</p>
 <p>Ahem... What am I thinking!?</p>
 <p>Regardless, it will be a strong force. Did the event just now make too much of an impact on him? So much that he feels like having his own power and army is necessary?</p>
 <p>That has always been the case in both the Modern World and the Three Realms. No matter how strong a person is, without a power under their control, the vast majority will only be wary of him and not truly fear him. The opposite has also been true, unless a power has someone of absolute strength behind them, people will not truly fear the force. I hope the Yellow Emperor is ready.</p>
 <p>Someone like him, who has reincarnated so many times in order to breakthrough and become an Immortal King, will definitely face countless tribulations. And only when he breaks through all of them will his hard work bear fruit.</p>
 <p>However, sometimes I do wonder... Was it truly worth it? Or maybe... Was there another reason beside his choice to reincarnate?</p>
 <p>Ahhh, whatever, that's really none of my business. First things first, I should get ready for tomorrow. Although he might be thinking of establishing his own power, he might also hand me some task to do...</p>
