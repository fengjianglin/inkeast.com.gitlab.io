 <p><span style>Chapter 214 – Wei Chen</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke pushed the staff with a lot of force, causing the person to nearly get pushed into the artificial pool.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Beauty, have you gone crazy…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm?” Xia Keke glared at him as a gold light flashed across her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the earlier scene, Xia Keke held no good impression towards the staff.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is very merciful of me not to push you down just now, or do you want to take a bath down there?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke’s eyes flashed with a bright golden light, causing the staff to fall limp onto the floor, trembling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Ye Zichen also yanked Xia Keke, “Keke, are you alright?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why did Keke get angry just like that? Could it be that her period has come?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>That truly was fast, she was fine just now.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m fine! Hehe, Zichen-gege, let’s not bungee jump anymore,” Xia Keke glared fiercely at the staff, then turned around to hug Ye Zichen by the shoulder and used the most violent way to quickly take off all the equipment he had put on. “Bungee jumping is too dangerous, let’s go back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Near the artificial lake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What the hell? Why did I suddenly have a dream?” A young man around 1.7 meters with permed hair and an otaku face, said, while he wore a pair of black-framed glasses. “He clearly bungee jumped, fell into the water, but why the hell did a water pillar suddenly spit him back up? Also, where did the bystanders go?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The permed hair young man scratched his face, then looked towards the bungee jumping platform, “Why is that person still standing there? Didn’t an accident happen to him..? F*ck this, what the hell! Never mind, coming outside really is unsuitable for me, I’ll just go back to playing games.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, the permed hair young man left as he shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’re not jumping anymore? Ye Zichen felt a huge sense of joy. To be perfectly honest, he didn’t want to jump, he was scared just looking at it. </span><i><span style>Isn’t there something wrong with me if I jump despite that?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>But then he thought about Xia Keke’s personality. </span><i><span style>She might be using this chance to mock me</span></i><span style>, “Don’t trick me, isn’t this just bungee jumping? If you said jump, then let’s jump.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not jumping, we’re not jumping anymore, “Xia Keke forcefully yanked Ye Zichen down. Su Yan and Sun Yige looked at this scene in confusion…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Keke…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yige, I feel like this is a personality issue, we have to think about it properly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sun Yige had a rather timid personality and didn’t really know how to refuse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Back when Xia Keke suggested bungee jumping in the dormitory, she did not refuse. Now that Xia Keke said that they’re not going to bungee jump, she didn’t refuse her again either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To be honest, she didn’t really dare to jump either, so not jumping was actually better.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, they left all together very quickly as if they were just touring the place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Leader, there’s a situation! The target did not choose to bungee jump, they left Extreme Park!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man, who had been watching Ye Zichen’s actions reported. The man in the clubhouse room frowned, while Huo Da, who sat opposite him raised his eyebrows, “Mr. Wei, what happened?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Huo, there’s a situation,” The man with a scar on the corner of his eye raised his eyebrows. “The target left Extreme Park!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He…” Huo Da’s expression darkened, then he laughed coldly. “Mr. Wei, I really don’t know how we’re supposed to cooperate in the future. Can people from your place not even deal with a normal person? Yu was whatever, but what did you promise me back then?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is Young Master Huo doubting me?” The scar-faced man’s expression also turned cold. “Although you’re the employer, don’t place yourself too highly. If it wasn’t because your family was rich, do you think you can get into contact with us? You’re just a mere business family!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wei Chen, say it again if you dare…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm?” Wei Chen raised his right eyebrow. At that moment, two men appeared behind Huo Da and the old butler and pressed down on their shoulders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huo Da’s expression darkened. A light flashed across the eyes of the butler standing behind him, “Mr. Wei, our family’s young master had no intention of doubting you. We understand that there are rules for people from your place to act. However, that brat is truly too cocky, our young master…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, how is it any of my business whether you are in a hurry? Since it has failed this time, wait for the next chance. Of course, I am happy to see you guys deal with it yourself. Alright, I’m tired, let’s talk next time,” Wei Chen snorted in disdain, stood up from the sofa and left the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huo Da smashed the glass tea table in front of him into pieces angrily, then looked at the closed door with a dark expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The f*ck is he pretending for…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master, we can’t afford to offend people from that place,” the butler walked over with a smile. Then he took out a bandage to wrap Huo Da’s hand up. “however, even if we, the Huo family, doesn’t rely on that place, we can still give that brat a fate worse than death…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Take charge of this. I have to give that brat a fate worse than death! Also, is there any news about Xiao Yumei?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Xiao family’s third young mistress seems to be preparing to establish a medical company!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, tell the person in charge to delay it, I want to make Xiao Yumei come and beg me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood! Then about Mr. Wei…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Organize it as well!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck, what the hell! Isn’t he just a businessman? He really thinks that he’s something,” Wei Chen’s eyes were full of disdain. He glanced at his subordinate beside him. “Give me a piece of gum...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Time suddenly came to a halt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wei Chen glanced at the subordinate who had stopped still in surprise, then saw a civilian old man appear in front of him as he looked up, alongside a white-robed man, who was holding a feathered fan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You guys…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t be nervous, we bear no ill intentions. Come, I want to chat with you!” The white-robed man grabbed Wei Chen, then the halted time begun to run once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, your gum… Boss, where’s boss!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen-gege, I’ll just send you off to here,” Xia Keke waved towards Ye Zichen with a giggle, then turned the car around and slowly disappeared from his sites.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stood underneath his dormitory and scratched his head. </span><i><span style>What was this? A tour…?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>We f*cking came back after going around Extreme Park once.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>But what made him more speechless was his brain!</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the last two days, he could always have some weird dreams, which were connected with each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He seemed to be a general in the dreams, and appeared very handsome as he dressed himself in armor. There was always a woman standing beside him. It was a woman that was way too beautiful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That woman never spoke, she merely looked at him, as if he was her everything. However, he was never able to see the woman’s face!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could I really be having delusions?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Buzz…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Ye Zichen made these silent guesses, the phone in his pocket rang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen took out the phone, then couldn’t help but smile when he saw the caller ID.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Right when I wanted to find her!</span></i></p>
