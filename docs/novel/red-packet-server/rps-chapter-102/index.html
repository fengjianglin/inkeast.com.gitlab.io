 <p><span style>Chapter 102 – White Impermanence has a request</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bring him away.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Xiyue looked at Liu Qiang coldly, while the two policemen she brought immediately brought him to the police car.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiyue, how is it? What did you guys talk about?” Zhao Ziming walked over after a glance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Xiyue smiled like usual, “We just asked him if anyone instructed him to do it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what did he say?” Zhao Ziming’s tone clearly seemed nervous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Xiyue shook her head, “He didn’t say, he just said that he has a grudge with Ye Zichen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll just treat it as me getting unlucky, but Officer Lin, you have to give me justice,” Ye Zichen sighed, then grabbed Li Jiayi, who was beside him. “There doesn’t seem to be anything else related to me, so I’ll be leaving first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Jiayi couldn’t help but ask the moment they left the police station, “Ye Zichen, why didn’t you guys directly arrest that person called Zhao Ziming when Liu Qiang admitted everything?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen knocked on her head, “You really are dumb, there is no solid proof, how are we supposed to arrest him? Although Liu Qiang admitted it, it wasn’t recorded, so it can’t be used as evidence.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh,” Li Jiayi rubbed her head with a pout.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled and stretched lazily, “This afternoon tired me out so much. Do you want to grab a bite together? I know that there is a western restaurant nearly that serves really good steak.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Steak… Ugh…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Jiayi, who were fine until then, suddenly puked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen quickly held her, and patted her back as he comforted her, “What happened? Are you okay? Do you need to go to the hospital?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Jiayi raised her head and looked at him with a complex expression, before biting her lips, “Even now, you still don’t want to admit it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye ZIchen was completely confused, “Admit what?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I-I might be pregnant.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Jiayi bit her lips, then stared straight at Ye Zichen’s eyes with her beautiful clear eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was stunned, then said frantically, “Who’s child, is it? Who’s the child’s father? Why haven’t I seen him, he’s too irresponsible.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a long time, Li Jiayi looked at him with a complex expression, “Isn’t he you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was completely confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why did he randomly become the father of another man’s child? Tiantian had leaped into his arms and called him daddy when she saw him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now Li Jiayi got pregnant and actually said that he was the father of her child.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What? </span></i><span style>Could it be that he has some sort of aura that made him become the father of another man’s child?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Disappointment flashed across Li Jiayi’s eyes when she saw Ye Zichen’s frantic look. However, she still remained strong, “I don’t need you to take responsibility, I can abort the child, all I need is your word.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My word for what? I didn’t even touch you, how is the child mine?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen opened his eyes wide. He definitely would admit it without saying anything else if he did it, but he didn’t, so he couldn’t just take the blame, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…” Li Jiayi bit her lips in anger. “I was drugged that day, and you stayed with me. The two of us laid on the bed together the next day, and I was naked. There were blood stains on the bed as well. You still want to tell me that it isn’t yours?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Jiayi couldn’t care about that much anymore, she can’t possibly abort a child for a man so randomly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the very least, she needed Ye Zichen’s recognition.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Contrary to her expectations, Ye Zichen, who was confused a while ago, suddenly laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is it really funny? Do you think that I’m funny?” Li Jiayi roared in anger. “I know you’re still in school, and I didn’t think about making you take the responsibility. I can slowly earn the money for the abortion, but at least you have to make me abort the child, while knowing everything.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen reached out his hand with a smile and caressed Li Jiayi’s hair, “You thought too much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn’t touch you at all that night,” Ye Zichen smiled helplessly. “You did get drugged that day, but I didn’t do anything. As for the redness you saw on the bedsheets the next day, isn’t that your period that came so coincidentally?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Impossible,” Li Jiayi shook her head, she had suspected that the bloodstain could be her period before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But she searched online and found that the only way to cure the drug was to…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“At the time, I actually just…” Ye Zichen suddenly blushed and smile coyly. “Actually I’m a judo master!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Judo!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>The way of rubbing!</span></i><span style><span> <a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Jiayi’s face instantly turned bright red. At the same time, Ye Zichen also grabbed her wrist, then let go of it very quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As I thought, your spleen and stomach is a bit weak recently. That’s why you puked so much. As for wanting to puke when you hear about oily stuff, that could be said as a psychological issue. You just have a bit of pregnancy delusion.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Jiayi bit her lips and was unable to utter anything for a long time. She never could have imagined that it had all been caused by her thinking too much.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uhmm… If you’re still worried, then we can go and check at the hospital,” Ye Zichen chuckled off to the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Jiayi shook her head, “No need, I believe what you said.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That caused the atmosphere to instantly turn awkward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh yeah, I have to hurry back to the shop, otherwise the shop owner will get worried,” Li Jiayi suddenly spoke up in the midst of the silence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows, “Then I’ll send you back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need, I’ll just go back by myself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Li Jiayi reached her hand out to stop a taxi, before disappearing from Ye Zichen’s sights.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who remained on the sidewalk, couldn’t help but shake his head with a smile. No wonder she would say such random stuff before.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So it was just a misunderstanding.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But that was nothing. The most important thing was that Zhao Ziming.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s fist couldn’t help but clench when his thoughts moved onto him. That grandson was definitely a villain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tiantian immediately leaped into his arms when Ye Zichen returned to his mansion. That little fellow was rather happy staying there. Since Lil’ White would play with her, she became a lot brighter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen with Tiantian in the living room for a while, then bought Lil’ White some dog food.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Speaking of that, the Heavenly Court’s Dog Food was truly expensive in the Treasure Shop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was 100 cultivation experience per pack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen still spent a lot in order for Lil’ White to become a Divine Beast in the future like the Howling Celestial Dog.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen directly bought 20 packs, which was enough for Lil’ White to eat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, this also meant that he had pretty much used up his cultivation experience.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clicked open his celestial plate as he laid on the bed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Celestial Plate: Sky Sovereign Nameless (Cultivation Experience: 3612. Level 4 Celestial Official)</span></p>
 <p><span style>He used the cultivation experience, but his celestial official level didn’t drop. However, he still didn’t know what this celestial official position did.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, he was also still searching for the method of promotion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rubbed his throbbing head, then got ready to quit WeChat and sleep.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His phone suddenly rang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only one that talked to him at this time of the day everyday was only that Miss White Impermanence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Ye Zichen expected, when he looked at the chats, he saw that it was White Impermanence, who was looking for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uhm… Are you there? I want to trouble you with a matter.”</span></p>
