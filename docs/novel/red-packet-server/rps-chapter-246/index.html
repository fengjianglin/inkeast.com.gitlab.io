 <p><span style>Chapter 246 – Abusing the Weakness</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just which group sent the red packet?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen quickly went to his chats and saw the Heavenly Court’s chat group, which was at the top of the list.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Red Packet from the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen instantly felt slightly sad.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>With the speed of those Heavenly Court deities, it would seriously be weird if I can grab a red packet now.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen still decided to give it a shot by clicking on the chat group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Too slow. All the red packets were gone.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I knew it.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Under the urging of his curiosity, Ye Zichen took a look at the treasure inside the red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>The red packet was sent by Wind Catching Ears<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>. There were 100 red packets in total, all of which contained a Long-Distance Sound-Seeking Sigil.</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: Hehe, I got one. I can go and exchange it for cultivation experience at the pawn shop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: @Immortality Peach Fairy, how much can you pawn it for?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mother of Lightning: @Yue Lao, how much are you treating this sigil as?</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Yue Lao isn’t in the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: Ai, the more talkative ones in the group all left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wind Catching Ears: What? Some deities left?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Barefoot Immortal: Back then, there was a huge war in the group. It is no surprise that great deity Wind Catching Ears, who just entered the group, doesn’t know.</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>All-Seeing Eyes<a id="footnoteref-2" href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>: Could you tell us a little about it?</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: @All-Seeing Eyes, great deity, there are admins monitoring the chat here. If you speak carelessly, you’ll get your salary reduced.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Gang: Ai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Uhm, don’t speak carelessly. If that geezer, Taibai Jinxing, sees it, then you wouldn’t avoid some scolding. @All-Seeing Eyes, your turn to send red packets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: Great deity has spoken.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chang’e: &lt;blushing emoji&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Gang: Ai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Heavenly Soldier A: Ai!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A series of sighs filled the screen. </span><i><span style>From the looks of it, these damn singles still didn’t recover from the trauma from Chang’e and my dog food.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>All-Seeing Eye: @Only Idealism, is this Sky Sovereign Nameless, who is renowned in the Heavenly Court recently?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: Correct, but no reward. Great deity told you to send red packets!</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Red packet! Red packet!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mother of Lightning: Red packet! Red packet!</span></p>
 <p><span style>All-Seeing Eyes: I’ve heard about your great name. I’ll send the red packet right away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Poke!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Ye Zichen had not snatched any red packets lately in the Heavenly Court’s chat group, the moment he managed to get one, he even felt a bit moved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received All-Seeing Eye’s Red Packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thousand Li Tracking Sigil x1.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thousand Li Tracking Sigil: Your eyes can see a distance of five hundred kilometers. Literally.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen took a glance at All-Seeing Eye’s red packets. All of the one hundred red packets were for this sort of sigil.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen twitched his mouth. </span><i><span style>I thought I could get some sort of rare treasure…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen did not continue to chit-chat with the deities, and just left straight away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Taibai Jinxing sent Ye Zichen a red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing: You helped this old one to moderate the group. Not bad, that’s worthy of a reward.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Who helped him moderate the group?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was stunned, then he instantly thought of the excuse he had used to ask for a red packet.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Even that counted as moderating the chat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing: This sovereign has been rather busy recently. The deities in the group all respect and fear you quite a bit, you can speak up more in it from now on. This sovereign will reward you well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great deity, I’m rather busy in real life too, so let’s talk about moderating the chat another time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just take a look at the group when you have time. Oh yeah, how’s the infiltration of the Underworld going?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mission accomplished!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was clear that Taibai Jinxing still had his doubts about Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen didn’t explain. Instead, he directly screenshotted the chat group and sent the image over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your intimacy level with Taibai Jinxing increased by 100. Current intimacy level: 200.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Intimacy level leveled up. Current intimacy level: Trusted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not bad, this is your reward for infiltrating into the Underworld group.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A red packet appeared on the screen. Ye Zichen collected it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received Taibai Jinxing’s red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cultivation experience x10000.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen instantly laughed when he saw the mission reward. He had worked so hard to get into the Underworld group in order to farm the intimacy level of the Underworld circle…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only to get ten thousand cultivation experience in exchange.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great deity Taibai, you’re too stingy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was speechless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing was stunned for a moment, before he sent his reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How so?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I do business in the Heavenly Court, it’s not like you don’t know of it. Yue Lao sends me several hundred cultivation experience whenever he stocks up. I worked so hard to get into the Underworld group and you merely gave me ten thousand cultivation experience? Tell me, are you stingy or not?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You still dare to mention this!?” Taibai Jinxing frowned. “Recently, these junk foods you have sent over to our Heavenly Court has severely affected its beauty. Peels and wrappers can be seen everywhere, this includes your packaging as well as poison…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t hold me in such high regard, can’t you guys, the deities, deal with such a little problem?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes. Even somewhere like the Modern Realm, where the mortals lived, can deal with that. He refused to believe that the deities in the Heavenly Court can’t!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing snorted coldly, and seemingly accepted the argument.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great deity Taibai, don’t worry about such small things with a civilian like me. I feel like you should raise the mission reward.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How do you want to do so? A hundred thousand cultivation experience?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing truly was unable to do anything despite being unwilling to negotiate with Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nobody in the Heavenly Court could infiltrate into the Underworld staff chat. Only someone like Ye Zichen, who was in the middle of the Three Realms, could do so.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t need cultivation experience, that’s something that even I can earn. I want some good treasures! Pills, sigils, celestial robes, secret scriptures or divine plants, basically anything useful to me is fine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t be too greedy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Greedy? I don’t think so! I am putting a suitable level of effort it, so I naturally have to gain a suitable level of reward. What’s more, my job is seriously dangerous. I’m being a spy. In tv shows, if the spies are caught, they either die or get trashed!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This sovereign doesn’t understand what you’re talking about.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then you don’t want to give me any. Fine, I’m done, I’m going to leave the group.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A voice message suddenly appeared on the screen. </span><i><span style>It seems like the geezer, Taibai Jinxing, is getting a bit anxious.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clicked on the voice message with a smile, then heard an ancient and angry voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just what do you want! Don’t challenge this sovereign’s bottom line!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want treasures!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen would have been scared before when Taibai Jinxing got angry. However, just who was he? The reincarnation of the Yellow Emperor, that’s who.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The powerhouses of the Celestial Realm are all his bros, just why should he be afraid?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll give you three hundred thousand cultivation experience!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, I want treasures!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The final purpose of earning cultivation experience was to exchange it for treasures in the Treasure Shop. However, not all the treasures were there, and that was a worse option than to directly ask Taibai Jinxing to send it to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m going to leave the chat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing instantly gave up when he saw Ye Zichen’s message. After a brief struggle, he sighed helplessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fine!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>You finally caved in!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Taking advantage of your weakness was definitely useful!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen licked his lips, then returned the ten thousand cultivation experience. At the same time, he also sent a message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“For this mission reward, I want a Hell’s Lotus!”</span></p>
