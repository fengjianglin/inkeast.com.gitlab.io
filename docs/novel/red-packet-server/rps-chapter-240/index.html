 <p><span style>Chapter 240 – Getting Food Poisoning from Eating Crap</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chang’e, who lived in the Moon Palace, got pimples!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>This was definitely a rather surprising thing for Ye Zichen. In his mind, deities should be able to get rid of the impurities in their body during the process of cultivation…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I didn’t think that eating spicy gluten would result in pimples. </span></i><span style>This was something that Ye Zichen did not expect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Chang’e’s voice transmission also rang out in Ye Zichen’s mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You should have seen it right? Buds like this keeps on popping up on my face. When one is finally gone, others will grow. I don’t want to hide it from you. Do you still like me like this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was beyond moved.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I really didn’t think that Chang’e would actually get troubled over this sort of thing.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen chuckled, “Fairy is still very pretty now. What’s more, I can deal with those pimples.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone had an interest in beauty. When Ye Zichen replied, he felt that Chang’e’s mood improved greatly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fairy, don’t fret. I’ll send you two treasures a while later to deal with the two pimples on your face.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can’t you do it now?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Having the two pimples on her face all the time affected my image in the Heavenly Court far too much.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems like it isn’t possible now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sky outside had already darkened. Even if Ye Zichen wanted to go out to buy skin care products, he wouldn’t be able to.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then… Alright!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the next day, after Ye Zichen finished his morning of lessons, he immediately ran towards the outside. When he passed by the woods on the school grounds…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“School Beauty Sun, our big bro sends his invitation,” Sun Yige was blocked off in the woods by two students.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She frowned at the two students in front of her, then replied softly, “I don’t know your big bro, please excuse me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>During so, Sun Yige reached out her hand to push the two students away. One of the students, who had slightly long hair, smiled, then reached out subconsciously to grab that hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“School Beauty Sun, our boss…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who’s your boss?” Ye Zichen chuckled as he patted the young man’s shoulders before he stood in front of Sun Yige and looked at the two students with a tilted head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are you!” The long haired student yelled loudly.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Right now, there wasn’t anyone in Polytechnic University that didn’t know me. </span></i><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but sigh when he saw how ignorant the long-haired student was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can Chen whatever you want. Brat, this isn’t a reason for you to…” Just as the long-haired young man was going to keep cursing, the buzz cut young man yanked him and muttered in his ear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Roughly half an hour later, the long-haired young man looked up again and glanced at Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brat, it seems like you’re a celebrity in your school, but our boss’s reputation at our school is no worse than yours here…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was speechless.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I didn’t come to compete in reputation.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows and eyed the two students in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re from another school, then there’s nothing much to be said. I’ll give you guys two choices, either screw off or get beaten. Choose!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I…” The long haired student glared at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen did not have the patience to wait for them to finish talking, so he directly made the choice for them, “It seems like you guys choose to get beaten. Fine, I’ll satisfy you guys…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ding dang dong…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen easily beat up the two students from another school, and the sound of it also attracted the school’s security over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Security, these two grandsons from another school came over to harass one of our school’s school beauty. Due to the justice my mother taught me while I was a child and the policy of taking caring of my fellow classmates, I beat up these two grandsons.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“From another school?” The guard frowned, then ignored the two’s blabbers and yanked them up from the ground. “Kids from another school coming to Polytechnic University to cause trouble… Come with me to the security office.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, thank you!” Sun Yige blushed as she held her textbooks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Ye Zichen chuckled, then replied in a teasing manner, “Welcome. Wow, our School Beauty Sun is truly famous! Even those from another school is unable to resist reaching out their evil hands for our School Beauty Sun.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you saying!” Sun Yige hit Ye Zichen’s chest with her fist softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Ye Zichen sent Sun Yige back to her dormitory, he continued with his plan of going to buy skin care products for Chang’e.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, just after he left the school grounds, he saw a group of people standing opposite him. The two students that he only beat up earlier were among them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, it’s this grandson!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sighed softly, then took out his phone to look at the time…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Excuse me, I’m in a hurry!” Ye Zichen walked towards the group of people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The long haired teenager, who got beaten up, cursed, “Grandson, are you blind? Can’t you see our boss?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen slapped the long haired teenager’s face with a huge enough force that caused him to spin around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems like you don’t remember getting beaten up, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are all Polytechnic U students so cocky?” At this moment, the young man in the very center of the group of people walked out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man was 1.8 meters. He had a buzz cut, and a body that wasn’t very buff. However, from his skinny body, one could tell that…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I don’t seem to be able to tell anything!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Although, from the dark circles around his eyes and his two saggy eye bags, it was obvious that his health was rather poor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I thought that only the person from Polytechnic U who is someone capable was that dandy, Fu Chengming, but even he doesn’t dare to hit my people in front of me.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the hell!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked speechlessly at the young man with a buzz cut. </span><i><span style>Does he really think that he’s really some mob boss?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style><span>“I think that you just got food poisoning from eating crap, who gave you the self confidence to do all this? You watched too much Young and Dangerous when you were younger right? Do you think that you’re Chicken Bro<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>! Just f*ck off, laozi is in a hurry.”</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe…” The young man instantly revealed a sinister smile that showed off his creepily white teeth as he stared at Ye Zichen…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I wonder if your power is as strong as your words!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, the buzz cut young man formed claws with his hands with an imposing aura.</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>All of his subordinates on the side gasped, while the long haired young man, who Ye Zichen slapped, exclaimed, “Grandson, you’re done for. My boss’s Tiger Fist<a id="footnoteref-2" href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>…”</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before the long-haired young man finished, the group of people saw that the buzz cut young man, who was still getting into position, got kicked to the wall by Ye Zichen. Furthermore, the footprint on his stomach was very clear, as was the handprint on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Retard!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen calmly stopped a taxi by the side of the road and left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did the buzz cut young man’s subordinates hurry over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck, this grandson doesn’t do things logically,” The buzz cut young man covered his face with his hands as he wiped tears from his eyes. “I didn’t f*cking get my stance ready when he came over to hit me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what do you think should be done…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The buzz cut young man slapped the long-haired young man’s head, “You tell me what! Send me to the hospital! Can’t you see that my nose is bleeding!?”</span></p>
