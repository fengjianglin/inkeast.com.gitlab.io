 <p><span style>Chapter 55 – Gu Tian</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>How could you not work your shoes if you kept on walking on the riverside?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>This definitely counted as Ye Zichen screwing up when he was extremely confident.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He maintained his confident smile, then mocked Guo Qiang meaningfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Guo is giving up just like that? When we first met, Young Master Guo seemed to have thrown several thousand yuan coolly on my face.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I truly cannot compare to Young Master Ye.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t believe it. </span><i><span style>Guo Qiang actually submitted.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, when Ye Zichen saw his mocking smile, he understood that this grandson was definitely waiting him to jump into the trap.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Fine.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Messing with me.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen laughed coldly and casually took out two thousand yuan from his wallet. He used the same cocky attitude as Guo Qiang had and threw the money onto Guo Qiang’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Take these and buy yourself some decent clothes, if you want to pick up a girl, you gotta have the cash to do so.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Qiang’s face immediately turned green.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It was the same action, the same words…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>These were clearly words that he had spoken to Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fuck off.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pointed to outside the Chanel store. He had to chase this grandson away quickly, then he would be able to confuse the clerk a bit and buy the bag for the original price.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Ye’s teaching are on point.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen didn’t think that Guo Qiang was so tolerant, he actually endured this insult with a faint smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The bag goes to Young Master Ye now. Clerk, hurry up and package the bag for Young Master Ye. Three million is an astronomical amount.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Guo Qiang emphasized the price of the bag, Ye Zichen’s face twitched.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Qiang only endured all of it, because he was sure that Ye Zichen didn’t have that much money on hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Ye Zichen really couldn’t pay, then he would be able to pay Ye Zichen back twice over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This truly troubled Ye Zichen. He truly lacked the money to buy it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The bag is mine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, a young man with smoke-colored hair walked out from the crowds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the clerk saw that young man, her expression immediately changed as she dipped her head to greet him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Gu.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the looks of it, he seemed to be a frequent customer of this Chanel store.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen twitched his eyebrows, and thought to himself. </span><i><span style>Why was he so unlucky today, he actually bumped into that guy again...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, him taking it is for the best, Ye Zichen didn’t need to lose face!</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, the manager of the store also came over after hearing that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Gu, why have you come?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My good friend is buying a bag in our store, and actually met someone that raised the price with ill intentions. What the hell was a manager like you doing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man with smoke-colored hair frowned, causing the manager to immediately reply in fright, “Young Master Gu, I didn’t know anything about it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, the manager knew everything about it, just now, he was thinking that no matter who buys the bag with such a high price, he would be able to earn a chunk. He didn’t expect Young Master Gu to actually show up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh,” Young Master Gu snorted coldly and said. “Young Master Ye is a good friend of mine, do you know what you should do now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The manager quickly pulled the clerk inside, while Young Master Gu also looked towards Guo Qiang with disdain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just now, I heard you say that you could buy this entire shop for the woman beside you if you wanted? Then I’ll sell the shop to you, fifty million, it’s a fair price.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Young Master Gu reached out his hand towards Guo Qiang, clearly indicating for him to pay up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Qiang was just getting pretentious when he had spoke like that just now. Although his family was indeed a bit rich, he can’t possibly have several tens of millions of pocket money.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No money? What are you pretending to be a big shot for!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Young Master Gu spoke without giving him any face. He clapped his hands, and the guards of the mall immediately rushed over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Gu.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ask these two people to leave. Oh yeah, take a photo of them, then hang a sign outside our mall. Dogs and them are not allowed in!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, the guards dragged Guo Qiang and Yao Yue away, while ignoring their resistance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Young Master Gu finally walked in front of Ye Zichen with a smile and reached out his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Ye, can we get to know each other now? I’m Gu Tian!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen didn’t hold any good will towards the brat in front of him and that geezer had actually threatened him back then. However, the other person did help him out of a tight spot, so he shouldn’t really put on airs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, the store manager and the clerk also placed the wrapped bag onto Gu Tian’s hands. Gu Tian casually handed it over to Ye Zichen with a smile, “Treat it as a gift from me, Young Master Ye.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen directly chucked the bag into Xia Keke’s hands after receiving the bag.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke looked at the bag Ye Zichen haded over in surprise, while a blush surfaced on her cheeks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your affability level with Xia Keke increased by 100. Current affability level: 110.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen knew it would turn out like this, he just didn’t think that the affability level would increase by so much.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, when he thought about it, Xia Keke did so much for such a bag. If she was a normal girl, she might even repay him with her body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In comparison, Xia Keke controlled herself pretty well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn’t think that Young Master Ye was an emotional person as well. An earth-shattering rage for a beauty. Three million was not a confidence that a normal person could have. However, this beauty is definitely worth Young Master Ye being so impulsive.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing Gu Tian’s words, Xia Keke blushed even more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your affability level with Xia Keke increased by 10. Current affability level: 120.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ugh.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was speechless, he was terrified of her affability level increasing too much. What if Xia Keke really falls in love with him?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The thing hardest to accept was a beauty’s favor.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He already had a woman beside him. He was afraid that he would disappoint Xia Keke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, now Gu Tian had done it. A single sentence cause the affability level to rise again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you have any business with me?” Ye Zichen was truly afraid of Gu Tian’s shitty mouth bullshitting anything else that would cause the affability level to rise again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I really do have something that I want to chat with Young Master Ye about,” Gu Tian didn’t deny it either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then let’s go,” Ye Zichen walked towards the door first. This completely confused Gu Tian, the last time he saw Ye Zichen, Ye Zichen had acted with hostility, but this time…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could it be that speaking good about Ye Zichen was of use?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Thinking that, Gu Tian couldn’t help but chat a bit more with Xia Keke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your affability level with Xia Keke increased by 30. Current affability level: 150.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen, who already walked outside the Chanel store received that notification, he nearly coughed up blood.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Gu Tian, f*ck you!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Within a music restaurant on the sixth floor of Business Building.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A lovely piano song swirled through the air in the restaurant, and the joyous sound would turn anyone’s mood better.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Ye Zichen…</span></p>
 <p><span style>His face was even darker than dirt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, you truly have good taste. I dare to say that the beauty is definitely truly natural without any additives. She is completely first rate, because you’re worth it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Until now, Gu Tian assumed that Ye Zichen only treated him like that due to Xia Keke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was why he couldn’t help but mutter a few more words to try to improve their relationship.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can you shut your damn mouth?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just how low was this brat’s EQ for him to be so naïve in reading the mood? If it wasn’t because of his help within the shop earlier, Ye Zichen would definitely slap him a few times so that he would clear up a bit.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Huh…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Tian was a bit confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From Ye Zichen’s tone, he seemed to have said the wrong thing?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That doesn’t make sense!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He’ll just change the approach…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Ye, I have no other thoughts about that beauty, I just thought that you two were a great match!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no way they could possibly chat.</span></p>
