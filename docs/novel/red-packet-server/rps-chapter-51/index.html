 <p><span style>Chapter 51 – Dog Father</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man with smoke color hair flattened his wrinkled clothes and smiled meaningfully at Ye Zichen’s back, then nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master, are you okay!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The elder seemed to have walked rather slowly, but his speed was very quick. He walked the distance of ten-odd meters in a few steps.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How could I not be?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The corner of the young man’s mouth raised, while a hint of dissatisfaction flashed across the elder’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That brat truly did not appreciate your kindness.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Most powerful people would of course have a bit of pride.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man indicated the elder to not mind Ye Zichen’s attitude and smiled faintly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Elder Hua, you might not know, but there’s a virgin ghost girl that had died before her time beside Ye Zichen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Elder Hua momentarily blanked out, then laughed happily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He deserves it. Virgin ghost girls specifically take male yang auras from men. No, wait, Young Master, you said one that died before her time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man nodded slightly and scratched his nose.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Most importantly, that young man seems to be able to see this virgin ghost girl and can even communicate with her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Hua’s expression suddenly changed, while his moving lips uttered not a sound.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a long time, he asked in a testing manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Could he have opened the Heaven’s Eye?”</span></p>
 <p><span style> “I’m not sure whether he actually did or not, but this person isn’t normal. It seems like he might be the same as our Gu family, and is from that place,” the young man shook his head smiled lightly, then left.</span></p>
 <p><span style> The elder immediately followed him. When they left, people would be able to notice that…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The grass they stepped on did not show any signs of being trampled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After arriving at the Ye family mansion, Ye Zichen sat outside on the stone chair in the courtyard without saying anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He clenched his fist tightly. He just couldn’t understand why someone would set their eyes on him and even affect his family.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, have some fruits.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>and chit-chatted with her. However, he continued to think about possible countermeasures in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he specifically looked for bodyguards, Ye Rong would definitely worry, thus, it would cause the opposite effect. Most importantly, normal bodyguards might not be able to match up to those people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Lil’ White raised its proud head and walked out of the mansion. When it saw Ye Zichen, it laid beside Ye Rong with a tsundere look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, Ye Zichen’s eyes brightened.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wouldn’t Lil’ White work just fine?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>No matter what, that guy is a dog from the Heavenly Court, it just might have some special abilities.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ White, come over.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen squatted in front of Lil’ White and clapped his hands. Lil’ White looked at him in disdain and ignored him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck, this damn dog.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>You’re not coming to me? Alright, then I’ll go over.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen walked in front of Lil’ White in a few steps and lifted it by the neck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mom, I’ll play a bit with Lil’ White.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Rong smiled warmly in response.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen casually chucked Lil’ White onto the gravel road outside the courtyard. Lil’ White agilely flipped around and landed stably on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After that, it raised its head in a tsundere-like manner and tilted its head in disdain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This dog is so interesting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing giggled in midair. Hearing that, Lil’ White lifted its head and bared its fangs towards her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It can see me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing momentarily blanked. On the other hand, although Ye Zichen was rather surprised, it wasn’t as if he couldn’t understand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Anything was possible for a species from the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ White once again nodded its head in a tsundere-like manner once again. It seemed like it could even hear Liu Qing’s words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing, who was in the air, instantly became interested in Lil’ White. She came down from the sky and squatted in front of Lil’ White in an attempt to pat it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Umu… Woof, woof…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You really can see me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style> Seeing that Lil’ White didn’t want to let her touch it, Liu Qing retracted her hands and looked at it with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ White raised its paws and started to draw circles on the ground, causing Ye Zichen to slap its head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop getting pretentious with us, laozi has business with you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Woof, woof…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ White became angry, a mere mortal actually dared to hit this celestial dog’s prideful head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It immediately leaped up towards Ye Zichen’s head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Smack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was met with another hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, Lil’ White became smarter, it merely bared its fangs at Ye Zichen before walking away towards the courtyard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A smart dog doesn’t mind taking temporary losses, it is too young right now, when it grows up…</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, what it doesn’t know was that a poodle like it can’t grow much larger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did I let you leave?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen yanked it back by the tail and raised his eyebrows towards it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ White, actually I have something to request of you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ White instantly glared and bared its fangs towards Ye Zichen, before starting to bark.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed like it was saying, you bully me even though you have something to request of me!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen chuckled, then reached out to touch Lil’ White’s head. Lil’ White instantly tried to bite him, but it was met with another slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop getting pretentious with me. I’m telling you, you can’t beat me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Umu,,,</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ White wagged its tail and lowered its proud head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that it submitted, Ye Zichen started to get into business.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re a dog from the Heavenly Court, do you have any special abilities?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wagged its tail and nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you, or do you not?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wagged its tail and nodded!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you believe that I’ll beat you up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his hand as if he was going to hit it. Lil’ White immediately looked towards Liu Qing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know what Lil’ White is saying.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing immediately stopped Ye Zichen, causing him to look at her in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You know?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah. I don’t know why either!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what did it say?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ White said to me that as a dog from the Heavenly Court, he naturally has special powers, but he’s still too young, so he doesn’t know how to do anything except getting pretentious.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what do I need you for,” Ye Zichen swore loudly in anger. This damn dog is truly strange, he pretends like he’s so fierce all the time, but he only knows how to be pretentious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Woof, woof…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did he say now?” Ye Zichen turned his head towards Liu Qing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He said that when he grows up, he’ll become amazing, even normal heavenly soldiers would not be able to beat him,” Liu Qing translated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Ziichen’s expression tensed. Even heavenly soldiers could not defeat it, that’s pretty strong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although he didn’t know just how strong heavenly soldiers were, since they were people form the Heavenly Court, then they would be people that mortals cannot defeat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dog was even stronger than heavenly soldiers, then wouldn’t it he be invincible in this lower realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How can you grow up!” Ye Zichen said once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Woof, woof…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He said that he can’t absorb any energy eating the stuff from here, so he can’t grow at all. It would be good if you can get something from the Heavenly Court.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s eyes brightened, doesn’t he just want the food from the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just how simple is that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Don’t forget, his sworn brother is a major dog owner in the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Woof, woof…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did he say now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He said you’re boasting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing couldn’t help but resist laughing as she translated it, but her heart was filled with surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This dog could see her, and she could understand what this dog was saying. Most importantly, this dog and Ye Zichen was actually talking about stuff like the Heavenly Court…</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, she remembered the chat group that Ye Zichen showed her.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Were they really a bunch of deities?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen also got annoyed since he was looked down upon by a dog.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little bastard, wait until laozi brings you food from the Heavenly Court, when that happens…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Woof, woof!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did he say now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He said that if you can get it, then it would be fine even if he admits you as his father,” Liu Qing translated honestly.</span></p>
