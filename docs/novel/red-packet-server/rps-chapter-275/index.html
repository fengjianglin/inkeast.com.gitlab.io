 <p><span style>Chapter 275 – Possession?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao continuously visited the large families in the Heavenly Court in his white robes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was essentially giving it his all. </span><i><span style>Isn’t it just notable people…?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>This old man WILL invite them!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He also naturally placed the Seven Fairies at the very end of his invitation list since he was not one hundred percent certain that he would be able to convince the Seven Fairies to participate in his dating show.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Yue Lao busied himself to no end in the Heavenly Court, Ye Zichen was in a similar situation in the Modern World.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as he was about to drive back to the mansion to take a look, Wei Teng walked over menacingly with dark circles around his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wei Teng slapped the front of Ye Zichen’s car.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen got out with a look of confusion, “What happened? You got beaten up?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tell me! Just what did you do to Sun Yige!” Wei Teng put up a horse stance angrily. “Give me ten minutes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s something wrong with you isn’t there!” Ye Zichen was speechless. “I didn’t do anything to her!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh heh…” Wei Teng smiled coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, the two of them stared at each other without doing anything until ten minutes had passed…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tiger Fist!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The image of a fist alongside a faint tiger roar flew over, causing Ye Zichen to raise his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He’s serious…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen quickly dodged to the side and took a look at Wei Teng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wei Teng dipped his head lethargically, as if using the Tiger Fist had used up all his energy…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This skill of yours is truly low-level!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It charged up for a super long time, had a super low accuracy and was a huge waste of his stamina….</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I really don’t understand why Wei Chen taught Wei Teng this move.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pulled Wei Teng’s arm and dragged him in the car as students came over to watch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you not staying in your school properly and always coming over to mine?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Say, just what did you do to Sun Yige?” Wei Teng leaned back in the front seat listlessly and muttered. “Just now, I came over to find Sun Yige. She said she likes you… And beat me up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sun Yige beat you up?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was stunned. When he saw Sun Yige in the woods back them, he had seen Wei Teng’s three lackeys lying on the ground…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t even dare to imagine Sun Yige being the one to beat them up, since from what he remembered…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How is it possible for Sun Yige to beat you up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re asking me, but how am I supposed to know!” Wei Teng glared. “School Beauty Sun clearly seemed like a cute girl several days ago, but when I took a look just now… She’s a true dominatrix! She’s also extremely evil in the way she hits. I feel like she is at least of the Spiritual Body level!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you sure?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows and exclaimed quietly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course. I’m telling you, the beating resistance my dad trained me to have means that it is nothing when False Spiritual Body level people hit me, I would only get a few bruises at most. But when Sun Yige hit me, even my bones felt pained!” Wei Teng complained. Doing so, he even took a deep breath since he had touched his injuries.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing his pitiful look, Ye Zichen took out his phone to exchange a Spring-Returning Pill for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is this!” Wei Teng looked at the pill vigilantly. “You can’t be wanting to poison me, right? I’m telling you, I’m not falling for it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who the heck has the effort to poison you!? This is medicine to help you with your injuries. Didn’t you get beaten up? It’s good for your wounds!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, then I’ll take it!” Wei Teng did not think too much into it, and directly took the pill over and popped it in his mouth without suspecting whether the pill really did as Ye Zichen said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His eyes lit up when the pill entered his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He could feel that a warmth flowed through his body, while the bruises on his face seemed to fade a little.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This medicine is amazing. Can you give me a few more? My dad always hits me…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen helplessly exchanged a few more pills form the Treasure Shop and placed it into his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thanks, I’m not going to stay here any longer. If I return home late, my dad’s gonna hit me again!” Wei Teng ran away from the car happily, as if he had already forgotten his purpose for coming over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen drove back to the mansion, he found that since Mu Jinglei was still down, Mother Ye had decided to take her out with Tiantian to clear her mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen continued to think about what Wei Teng had said as he sat on the sofa.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Sun Yige actually had Spiritual Body leveled strength.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Don’t joke with me…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But Sun Yige is indeed kind of weird recently. </span></i><span style>Ye ZIchen couldn’t help but take out a Thousand-Li Tracking Sigil from his Treasure Chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Target confirmed: Sun Yige.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This familiar image... It seems to be…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>The bathroom!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was stunned. </span><i><span style>Why did I ended up tracking her to her shower? I swear to god, I did not have any naughty thoughts.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Just as he was about to turn the image off, Sun Yige’s mutterings caught his attention.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just what are you doing? Why are you possessing my body and not leaving!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sun Yige had a revealed a painful expression as she writhed on the floor. Not long later, she stood up once again and smiled calmly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What, don’t you like it this way? Didn’t you always hoped for yourself to become fiercer?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry up and leave my body. I don’t like myself like this!” Sun Yige held her head and yelled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, not long later, her expression changed once more, “You are truly a weird chick. You clearly hope to become like this in your heart, yet you are saying that you dislike it now…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was completely stunned as he watched Sun Yige act like two completely different characters.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Split personality?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>The one in pain was clearly the Sun Yige I knew, while the more bossy one seemed to have robbed Sun Yige of her body…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the hell! Does the possession which happens in novels occur?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>If that’s the case, then I have to save Sun Yige!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had wanted to watch on for a little longer, but Sun Yige suddenly frowned and roared, “Who dares to peek at this sovereign’s shower…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The image in front of Ye Zichen immediately shattered as he panted heavily while grasping his chest!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Sun Yige’s gaze is truly too terrifying. What’s more, she actually noticed All Seeing Eye’s Thousand-Li Tracking Sigil.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Ye Zichen also made certain of another fact!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Sun Yige was definitely possessed.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, he definitely cannot just mindlessly go over. Ignoring the fact that he didn’t know how to help Sun Yige get her body back, him going over like this may also cause her to be on guard.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Possession, in this case, if it’s like what novels said, it should be when another soul entered one’s body.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Since it’s like this…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Ox-Head!’ Ye Zichen took out his phone and sent a message to Ox-Head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little bro, what is it?” Ox-Head smiled. “Oh yeah, Ox-Head got some ghosts to teach those mortals you talked about a lesson!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you, Big Brother Ox-Head!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately sent Ox-Head a red packet of five thousand merits.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ox-Head collected the red packet, a smiled bloomed on his face when he saw the merits.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This little bro is truly amazing, he is giving out merits just like this.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Little bro, just what are you doing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ox Bro helped little brother teach those mortals a lesson, so just use these merits to buy some drinks,” Ye Zichen smiled faintly. “Ox Bro, little brother has something to ask!”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Original Chapter Teaser:</b>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;">Ahhh, my sweet love Sun Yige, I'm coming to find you!</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Although you don't like me right now, I will fight on for my sake and yours. One day, you will accept me and love me! I love you so much, always and forever, more than the heavens and earth or the moons and stars. You are the apple of my eye, the sunshine of my life. Ahh, Sun Yige, I have truly fallen for you!</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Yes, I'm going to see Sun Yige soon! Like any moment now!</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Wait, huh? This isn't going on like I imagined. Hmm? What's going on? Why did...</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Argh, what the f*ck? SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT THE F*CK JUST HAPPENED! How the hell did Sun Yige completely beat us up? And even though her new look is sexy and all, she isn't like that pure maiden anymore!</p>
 <p>Dammit, this must be Ye Zichen's fault. It definitely is!</p>
