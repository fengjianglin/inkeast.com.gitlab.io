 <p><i><span style>Black Silk Stockings?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>As expected of Sky Sovereign Nameless, he always brings out these miraculous treasures. </span></i><span style>Just as Old Lord Taishang was about to open the packaging to see what was inside, he saw another message from Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This black silk stocking is of rather poor quality. You can use from better materials to weave one that’s identical. Of course, it’s fine if you can’t find any, but they’ll get a run in them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay, okay.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang replied with a chuckle. However, when he opened the packaging…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the hell is this!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>What Old Lord Taishang saw was a pair of item that was similar to a pair of socks, but it was very smooth and elastic, while the texture also felt very good.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, I want to ask. Just how in the Heavens do you use this treasure?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Old Lord Taishang did not understand, and was unable to see how the black silk stockings were anymore special than normal items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s to be worn on the legs. Oh yeah, research into it yourself. I still have stuff I have to do!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After typing out the response, Old Lord Taishang stared at the pair of black silk stockings for a long time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, approximately ten minutes later, he took off his shoes, and begun to put them onto his feet. He only managed to put them on a good half an hour later. Then, when he walked in front of the bronze mirror to look at his image…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang quickly looked away. Just that look had nearly caused him to puke.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Are you kidding me? Can this actually be given to the Queen Mother!? If I offer it as a gift, the Queen Mother might even want to kill me!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Sky Sovereign screwed me over!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, can you stop messing around? Hurry up and send me the real treasure!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aren’t you just messing with me!? I was so sincere with you, you can’t treat me like this!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Old Lord Taishang was extremely anxious, Ye Zichen had no time to pay any attention to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understand now? These pills are all beneficial towards them, so just get them to take it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen withdrew all the pills, filling up the majority of the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wei Chen nodded in shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Ye Zichen also spoke again, “Try to find some stronger people to join our organization soon. Tell me directly what you need. As long as I can do it, then do what you can to satisfy them!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If that’s the case…” Wei Chen suddenly licked his lips. “Then Boss Ye can try to get Xiang-jie to join our organization.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiang-jie?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She’s the big sis down stairs. She… isn’t a normal person. According to my recent observations, she is an Earth Immortal or even above that. I have offered a position to her several times, but she ignored me. You can go and try if Boss Ye really needs the strength!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It truly was as I thought.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen thought to himself. </span><i><span style>I already felt like this beautiful woman wasn’t a normal person, but I didn’t expect her to be an expert that was at least an Earth Immortal.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But why is an expert like her working at this teahouse previously. What makes me mind more is that she didn’t even leave after the tea house changed owners.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen squinted his eyes and licked his lips, “Distribute the pills, and get those brats to quickly increase their strength. I’ll go and try to invite Xiang-jie. If I can, then I will, if I can’t, then try to get her to leave our teahouse as soon as possible.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem!” Wei Chen nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Ye Zichen walked down stairs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he passed by the beautiful woman, she spoke up with a smile, “Boss Ye is leaving again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiang-jie? Ye Zichen suddenly stopped in his tracks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The beautiful woman nodded with a smile, “What is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why do you keep on staying at this teahouse?” Ye Zichen glanced at her with a smile. “I don’t feel like trying to make a living is too impossible. You are staying here in order to guard something, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiang-jie remained silent for a brief moment, then smiled, “Boss Ye is truly smarter than others. You guessed it right, I am guarding a certain treasure.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then… I wonder if you are a friend or a foe?” Ye Zichen asked once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Xiang-jie shook her head with a smile, “Neither. I am purely here to guard the treasure. It will be taken by the fated one. When the treasure is taken away, then I will follow that person away as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are an artifact spirit!” Ye Zichen was stunned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiang-jie blinked, “You guessed it right again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I didn’t think that this beautiful woman was actually the artifact spirit of a certain divine artifact. No wonder I couldn’t tell her original form using my Fiery Eyes of Truth just now.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“It looks like you want to try? You are too weak. You have to be at least an Earth Immortal if you want to touch that divine artifact!” Xiang-jie smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen scratched his head awkwardly when his thoughts were pointed out, “Does everyone have a chance to take that divine artifact?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No! Those people at least have to be people that I like the look of. I like you quite a bit. Come and find me when you become an Earth Immortal, big sis will give you a chance to try,” Xiang-jie smiled softly, then shrugged. “I have stood guard here for too long. I really hope that you can take me away!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I’ll definitely come and bother you when I become an Earth Immortal,” Ye Zichen cupped his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiang-jie nodded, “Come then. Oh yeah, you are looking for demons, right? Actually, a demon has been by your side the entire time… Work hard, little brother!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who was about to leave, was shocked. He turned around and only saw Xiang-jie tilt her head with a smile at him, while she waved her hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t think about gathering information from me, and don’t even consider getting me to help you against the demons. The only reason I told you was because big sis got interested in you all of a sudden.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded and left with a smile. Then, after he left, Xiang-jie sat down at the teahouse reception once again without speaking as usual.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>By my side!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The expression of Ye Zichen, who sat in the car, was filled with worry. The people around him were mostly normal people, so how could they be demons?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But what that divine artifact-jie jie said should be used. I need to give it a good thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen parked his car by the side of the road, then shut his eyes tightly, while he pictured all of the people around him. However, the result he got was that none of them was a demon.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could there be someone that I didn’t count?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s phone rang once again while he hesitated. When he took out his phone, he placed the phone by his ear after seeing the caller ID.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fatty, what is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eldest Hou, you guys try and hold on for a bit longer, I’m calling Boss Ye,” Fatty Yin’s scream sounded out from the other end of the call.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen squinted his eyes, “Just what exactly happened?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry up and leave, if you don’t… Then I’m going to attack!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck, I am the third disciple of Great Emperor Qingmeng, you actually dare attack me?” Third Fatty Jin shouted, then he turned to the phone once again, “Boss Ye, can you hear me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, I’m asking you what happened?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, hurry back!” Third Fatty Jin’s voice contained a faint sense of worry, “Third Fatty Jin said with an extremely nervous voice. “Di Tian’s older brother is here. He wants to take Di Tian away. We can’t really stop him anymore!”</span></p>
