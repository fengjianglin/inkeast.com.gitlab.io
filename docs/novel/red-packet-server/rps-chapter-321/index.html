 <p><span style>Chapter 321 – Chang’e is Descending to the Mortal Realm</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You said you’re descending to the mortal realm!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chang’e’s words caused Ye Zichen to shout out in surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who was holding a wine glass, shuddered, spilling the wine some of the wine out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, what are you talking about!?” the fatty was completely confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen ignored him, sat down and replied in his mind, “You said that you want to descend to the mortal realm. Why did you suddenly have that kind of thought?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s so strange about it? Aren’t you in the mortal realm?” Chang’e said proudly. “I wasn’t just sitting idle during this period of time that you didn’t contact me. I have been deducing your location, and from the result just now, I found out that you are at that abandoned place!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Abandoned place?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is the place where we’re living an abandoned place of the Heavenly Court?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Why aren’t you saying anything? Are you surprised that I actually managed to find you?” Chang’e said like a little woman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am indeed a bit surprised,” Ye Zichen replied plainly, while a tsunami coursed through his heart.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I’m not just a bit surprised, I’m utterly shocked.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>If the news of Chang’e descending to the mortal realm to find me wasn’t surprising, then that would definitely be strange.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Actually, I’m really nervous right now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within the Moon Palace, Chang’e’s face was bright red as she sat by the window and gazed at the ancient tree outside the Moon Palace. Ever since her and Ye Zichen declared their relationship, Wu Gang had never went to chop would by her palace again, allowing her to rest extremely well, and let her skin become much better.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We already confirmed our relationship so long ago. It’s time that we meet,” Chang’e transmitted her voice with a blush.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, the Jade Rabbit muttered on the side with a packet of spicy gluten in her hands, “Sis, why is your face so red?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just go and eat your spicy gluten,” Chang’e said in annoyance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Jade Rabbit stuck out her tongue, then skipped away with the packet of spicy gluten.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Me-Meet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stuttered, while feeling strange about Chang’e’s determination to descend.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m preparing to descend three days from now. I have to organize some things during these few days. You have to wait for me,” Chang’e giggled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, okay!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, then see you in the mortal realm!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Chang’e transmitted her message, she clenched her beating heart with her right hand as she bit her lips with a look of joy, while settling everything that she had to.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Ye Zichen turned completely shocked in the room.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>She really is going to descend.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, what happened?” Fatty Yin raised his hand and waved it in front of Ye Zichen’s eyes. “Why are you so shocked? If you give me a heart attack like this, I’m going to ask you for compensation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen maintained the look of shock on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, bro…” Fatty Yin waved his hands in front of Ye Zichen a few more times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did he return to his senses and turned to look at Fatty Yin, “What happened?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your shocked appearance seems like you just got cooked by someone,” Fatty Yin revealed a look of helplessness. “You still didn’t tell me why that brat called you Ye Zichen!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a long when, when Ye Zichen finally calmed himself down, “That? The name I told that brat was my artist name. My artist name is Ye Zichen…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty Yin immediately acted like he understood, “So it’s like that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he couldn’t help but retort in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>You’re still pretending? I’m going to see how long you can keep the act up for. Artist name? Do you really think laozi doesn’t know what you’re really called?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>After a few rounds of drinking, Ye Zichen and Fatty Yin left the hotel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, Fatty Yin was not satisfied by the drinking at all, since Ye Zichen had maintained the look of shock the entire time, causing the fatty to get rather annoyed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, how about we change a place to drink a few more rounds?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nah, I’m a bit tired, so I want to go back to the hotel.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen hailed a cab and left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen returned to the room at the inn, he laid on the bed and stared at the ceiling blankly.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chang’e is really going to descend?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>The reason she fell for me might have been due to how mysterious I am. If she descends and sees that I’m just a normal person, she’ll definitely be very disappointed.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s more, how would I find the time to take care of her if she really descends?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I already have enough women by my side, if another one appeared, then those girls would definitely beat me to death.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen licked his lips, then took out his phone to seek out Taibai Jinxing.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Since he’s the head butler of the Heavenly Court, if I ask him, he might have a way to stop Chang’e from descending.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Geezer, geezer…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it? I’m busy,” Taibai Jinxing directly replied with a voice message.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Busy?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately activated the Great Dao of Heaven’s Birth and targeted Taibai Jinxing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Taibai Jinxing was sitting within the principal’s office of the Heavenly Court school. He frowned, while looking at the reports that the teachers and class tutors sent over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“These little bastards, seriously…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The establishment of the school was decent, and that fact that the students were managed by others meant that the celestial second generations no longer laid idly around, and instead had something to do.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, even though the celestial second generations were quite responsible, the little ones didn’t know how to study properly!</span></p>
 <p><span style>They merely only knew how to play every day without doing anything else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened, those midgets aren’t listening to you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sent a voice message plainly. Not long after that, laughter suddenly sounded out in Taibai Jinxing’s room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The laughter completely shocked Taibai Jinxing…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who, who dares to pry at this sovereign!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who? I’m Sky Sovereign Nameless!” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes speechlessly as he looked at the shocked Taibai Jinxing. “If there’s a problem with the school, come and find me! I accept consultations any time, but obviously we have to talk about the fees!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You-You begun to understand the Laws of the World?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing’s expression was full of shock</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Ye Zichen was also momentarily stunned…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I seem to recall Monkey King and Erlang Shen mentioning prying into the Laws of the World when I went to resolve their conflict.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“So what? How could you tell!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Prying into the Laws of the World, that’s exactly what you’re doing. This sovereign cannot feel your existence, but can receive your voice transmission, that’s utilizing the Laws of the World…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing’s expression as beyond speechless. When he thought about how he had been a deity for over a hundred thousand years…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was still merely a late-stage Sky Immortal, while the old brat, Old Lord Taishang was merely a complete stage Sky Immortal.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>But anyone that can pry into the Laws of the World were definitely half a step into the level of an Immortal King.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Yet, the brat I targeted was just a normal mortal, how is it possible for him to…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Tell me the truth, just who exactly are you? Why can you actually pry into the Laws of the World while living in the abandoned place!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can only say that I don’t understand what you’re saying,” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows speechlessly. “I am just a mere mortal. Laws of the World? Are you trying to scare me? Oh, I get it. Do you want to scare me so that I’ll decrease the consultation fees? We’re acquaintances, so I definitely won’t rip you off!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t be vague. Say it! Are you the reincarnation of a heavyweight!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing stood up, slammed the table and frowned.</span></p>
