 <p><span style>Chapter 280 – The Pitiful Erlang Shen, Yang Jian</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Yang Yushi.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>This person would always get randomly brought up by the people around me. Originally, I thought that there would never be any kind of connections between us anymore, I never expected Xiao Yumei to actually mention her.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s with your expression?” Xiao Yumei called softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothing, I just didn’t expect the person you to be talking about actually be her. She really is a true bigshot, could she actually get interested in our small medical company?” Ye Zichen smiled faintly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn’t you just say that we have to have confidence in our product? I have confidence that our company will become one of the leading companies of the cosmetics industry in the future,” confidence swirled in Xiao Yumei’s eyes. This confidence was not out of nowhere, rather, it was because she had absolute faith in their products.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It really was going to be hard for a product that could quickly heal one’s body, any facial scars and improve their skin not to get popular.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh yeah,” Ye Zichen smiled slightly forcefully. To be perfectly honest, he didn’t want too much to do with Yang Yushi in any shape, fashion or form.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I’ll leave getting Yang Yushi to be our spokesperson to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem,” Xiao Yumei smiled softly, then immediately revealed a naughty smile. “Even if we can’t find Yang Yushi, then we’ll get your little girlfriends as spokespeople. They don’t look any worse than celebrities, the only slight issue would be the lack of a reputation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“… Don’t screw with me!” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes speechlessly. Xiao Yumei was truly someone that would find chances to tease and make fun of him whether she had the time or not.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zeze, am I supposed to screw other people if I don’t screw you?” As she spoke, Xiao Yumei subconsciously pushed out her full breasts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen squinted his eyes as he looked at her alluring look, “You are seducing me into committing a crime!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>An hour later, Ye Zichen leaned back on the sofa with his collar buttons undone, while Xiao Yumei leaned on his shoulder with a faint redness on her face like a tamed kitten.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Buzz.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The phone on the table rang. Xiao Yumei stood up and picked up the phone lazily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, she hung up and smiled towards Ye Zichen softly, “I’m going out to deal with some stuff.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm!” Ye Zichen nodded with a smile, lit a cigarette for himself and took out his phone…</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t a big deal when he didn’t look, but the moment he took a look, he was completely shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His Red Packet Server actually had 999 unread messages.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He subconsciously looked at the number of members in the group. 7.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he took a look at the messages on the screen, only to find the Monkey King and Erlang Shen having a flame war.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Monkey, laozi is going to duel you.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: Hehe, my son, you…?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Fight me if you dare.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: I, Old Sun, is busy. I have no time to waste with you.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: You’re just scared!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: I, Old Sun, is scared of you? Give me your position now. I, Old Sun, can beat you to a pulp with just a body double.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: Where’s the fight? Send some coordinates, I, Old Pig, is going to come and take a look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Fortune: Peace brings wealth!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang: If you get hurt, then buy pills from me. We’re all acquaintances, so I’ll give you twenty percent discount.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: Just what is this for.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: @Yue Lao, you dare to come out…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: True Lord Erlang, please don’t be angry. This has nothing to do with this old man.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s going on? Why is it related to Yue Lao?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen did not have the patience to scroll up and read everything, so he just directly spoke up in the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on? @Everyone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Brother Nameless, I’m suffering!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang: It’s just a small grudge between youngsters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: &lt;insert a roll of black face emojis&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: @Only Idealism, I, Old Sun will send you a PM.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: @Monkey King! You dare!?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: What does I, Old Sun, not dare to do? I, Old Sun, isn’t going to PM it anymore. I, Old Sun, will just send it here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, a video appeared on the screen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clicked on the video with a look of confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was rather stunned when he saw the setting of the video. </span><i><span style>Isn’t this where If You are the One Heavenly Court version was held?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen continued to watch…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen appeared in his silver war armor, while the third eye on his forehead also flashed with a faint white light. He held his three-pointed, double-edged divine lance in his hand while he rode on top of a white horse. At the same time, the Howling Celestial Dog also raised its proud head and swept its gaze over the fairies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Ye Zichen couldn’t help but be shocked when he saw this. </span><i><span style>I never thought that my bro was this cool…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, it was all thanks to Ye Zichen. If he didn’t teach Erlang Shen how to play Landlord, the latter was going to have to sell his weapons sooner or later. It was fortunate that Erlang Shen learned how to play Landlord, allowing Erlang Shen to become a true “tall rich and handsome” in the Heavenly Court!</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he was in the Modern World, he would definitely be the target of many girl’s dreams…</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, those fairies…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did he come?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know, I didn’t hear that he’ll come to this show!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I heard daddy say that he’s number one in the flaming circles of the Heavenly Court…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No way, no way, we can’t have someone like him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom…</span></p>
 <p><span style>All twenty six of the candles were blew out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Yang Jian in the video was instantly stunned and the Howling Celestial Dog did not manage to react at all, instead it merely stuck out its tongue dumbly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, don’t make a mistake, blowing the candle out means not wanting to date me…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We know, so hurry up and leave!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>One of the girls said, while the others also agreed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only the six out of the Seven Fairies smiled apologetically, “We are relatives, sorry!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Erlang Shen in the video was truly shocked as he opened his eyes wide, while listening to the boos around him…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You guys aren’t interested in me… laozi?” Erlang Shen shook his head, then spat on the floor. “Tsk, aren’t interested in laozi. Laozi… I am not interested in you girls, you… bunch of unmarried spinsters. I came over to stop your suffering in good will. Hmph, you deserve dying alone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but facepalm with a sigh when he saw Erlang Shen’s lame actions.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So shameful, this is even more shameful than getting all the candles extinguished.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But… Why did he sound so weird when he spoke?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen left bitterly in the video as it ended. When Ye Zichen returned to the chat group, he saw that Erlang Shen and Monkey King started to argue again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“@Erlang Shen, I have watched the video. Rest in peace.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Erlang Shen sent Ye Zichen a PM.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, you saw that video?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm,” Ye Zichen nodded faintly. “It is rather embarrassing to get all the candles extinguished, but your words afterwards were even more so…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That isn’t me!” Erlang Shen, who was in his manor, stomped his feet in anger. “That Erlang Shen was one that the monkey transformed into!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?” Ye Zichen was shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That monkey gave me a bottle of monkey wine when before he went on stage, causing me to randomly fall asleep,” Erlang Shen sighed. “Then when I woke up, I noticed that the dating show was over.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was truly speechless. </span><i><span style>Great Sage is truly evil. But on the side note, the Seventy-Two Transformations is truly amazing. If I learn it, then can’t I make others take the blame as well!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“But it was whatever that he caused my reputation to become worse. I, Yang Jian, am not afraid of that. What I’m f*cking angry about is that…” Erlang Shen paused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you angry about?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m angry about them all blowing out my candles. No matter what, I, Yang Jian, am a handsome guy in the Heavenly Court. Even the monkey had six candles remaining, but I didn’t get any at all! Are they saying that I, Yang Jian, am even worse than a monkey?”</span></p>
