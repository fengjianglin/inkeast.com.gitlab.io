 <p><span style>Chapter 261 – Literari Star’s School Report[1. Literari Star (文曲星) is a deity that is very well versed in academic stuff. He is often portrayed as very wise and intelligent, and is often featured as the opposite of the Martial Star (武曲星), who is very proficient in fights and war. It should also be noted that Literari Star can also be a term that is used to describe an official to the Emperor. In the past, people that became officials due to being good at writing were sometimes seen as an incarnation of Literari Star.</span><span style>Previously in Chapter 64, I had used Megrez due to it being the star that corresponds to the deity, that has now been changed.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen accepted Earthen Lord’s friend request.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He habitually glanced at the intimacy level. It was 200. Trusted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, thank you for helping this little deity solve my issues!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it wasn’t for Ye Zichen, Earthen Lord really might have continued getting troubled over the issue of the celestial children. He is an old man, so he really couldn’t take much from the children.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It was a simple task!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen did not actually think that much, he merely wanted to screw over the celestial children in the Heavenly Court once. </span><i><span style>Since we, the mortals, have to go to school and do homework in the lower realm, I want those celestial children to feel that pain too.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>At the same time, I can also make those deities in the Heavenly Court feel the pain and joy of being a teacher!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Little deity doesn’t know how to thank Sky Sovereign either. This is something that this little deity accidentally recieved, I hope it is of use to Sky Sovereign.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earthen Lord promptly sent Ye Zichen a red packet, which the latter received with a raise of his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mystery Envelope x1</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clicked on the Treasure Chest. There really was an envelope inside. Then, Ye Zichen looked at the description…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mysterious Envelope: A very mysterious envelope!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck, it really is mysterious!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but shake his head with a wry smile before chit-chatting slightly more with Earthen Lord, then leaving the chat interface.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, in the Cloud Palace of the Golden Arches…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing, who held a fly-whisk in his hands, stood at the bottom of the stairs. He had just told the Jade Emperor and the Queen Mother about Ye Zichen’s ideas.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jade Emperor, what do you think…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Jade Emperor frowned, then smiled, while gripping the throne.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not bad, it’s great! Taibai Jinxing, your idea is great, and it can be used. Say it, what sort of reward do you want?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This wasn’t an idea thought of by by this little deity,” Taibai Jinxing raised his eyebrows with a smile. “It was thought up by a comrade of the Heavenly Court.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh?” The Jade Emperor raised his eyebrows. “Call him over!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That would be a bit difficult. That celestial friend is in a secret location right now!” Taibai Jinxing explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What a pity. It really is a pity that I can’t meet that talented one!” The Jade Emperor sighed softly. He waved his right hand, causing a golden scroll of decree to appear in the palace. “The establishment of the school will be overlooked by you. You can use this decree in order to order anyone to help!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Endless Merits. You have gained 100 Reputation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who was lying down and playing with his phone, suddenly received a notification…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just what the hell is this Reputation feature?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen frowned. At that moment, he had already gotten 127 Reputation, but he still couldn’t figure out what Reputation did for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Taibai Jinxing sent him a message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The establishment of the school has been ordered, you have completed a great achievement.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that so? Then, Great Deity Taibai, give me some good stuff, I’m already immune to verbal praise.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing raised his eyebrows, then tapped lightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received Taibai Jinxing’s red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Identification Stone x1</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This sovereign managed to foretell that you will need this stone, so treat it as your reward!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>No way!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the heck is this reward!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at his phone’s Treasure Chest and the pitch black stone within, in shock, while being beyond speechless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Say, you’re not screwing me over, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Ye Zichen sent the message, he suddenly received a system notification on his phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The system has detected that the Mysterious Envelope can be identified. Would you like to identify it now?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen revealed a look of understanding when he saw this. </span><i><span style>So the stone is actually for this envelope.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Say, that geezer, Taibai Jinxing, is truly amazing, he actually managed to foretell this.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was rather interested in the envelope anyway. Since it could be identified, he naturally chose to do so.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A dazzling white light flashed from the screen. Ye Zichen subconsciously closed his eyes. When the light faded and he finally clicked on the Treasure Chest…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Identification successful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Congratulations, you have received Literari Star’s School Report!</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, in the Literari Star Hall…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Literari Star, who was immersed in the sea of knowledge, trembled, put down the book in his hands, then continuously formed signs with his fingers…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, his expression drastically changed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He took out his phone, found Only Idealism in the WeChat group and sent a friend request.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who had just received Literari Star’s School Report was shocked. </span><i><span style>This thing seems to be sold for several million cultivation experience in the Treasure Shop.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Before he returned to normal from his surprise, he saw a friend request.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Literari Star has sent a friend request.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why did he add me? Could it be for that school report?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen thought silently to himself, but he still accepted the friend request.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Daoist friend!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Literari Star’s intimacy level was Friendly. Ye Zichen did not feel the need to feel worried at all as long as it wasn’t Cold. When he saw the news, he also replied immediately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Daoist friend!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, I want to get straight to the point. I wonder if daoist friend has found a school report?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He really came for that.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, I did receive one of daoist friend’s cultivation experiences.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen replied honestly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Daoist friend didn’t take a look, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn’t manage to get the chance to yet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s for the best. Could daoist friend return the school report to me? I can give daoist friend a suitable amount of thanks.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This guy is so worried about the school report, could there be something special about it?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen subconsciously took the school report out, laid on the bed and looked at it for a long time…</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was filled with strange characters that Ye Zichen could not understand at all. </span><i><span style>Also, this school report also seems to be rather old…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Daoist friend!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Daoist friend, where did you go off to!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Daoist friend, can you give me that school report?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Daoist friend, say something!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Literari Star rapidly became very anxious merely from Ye Zichen not replying for a while. Ye Zichen glanced at the school report he couldn’t read. Although he couldn’t understand it, the information definitely couldn’t come to light. Otherwise, Literari Star wouldn’t have become so anxious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uhm… I wonder why Brother Literari is so worried about this school report?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen asked in a testing manner. However, Literari Star did not have any intention of revealing it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That doesn’t have anything to do with daoist friend. I wonder if daoist friend can send me the school report? I will definitely give something that can satisfy daoist friend in exchange!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Satisfy!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen twitched his mouth and looked around the Treasure Shop. The most expensive thing about Literari Star that could potentially be given seemed to be his book of memory techniques.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was worth three million cultivation experience.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen licked his lips and raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m interested in daoist friend’s experience on memory techniques.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Literari Star had already gotten himself ready for the other person to name something outrageous. However, he never would have expected that the other person merely wanted his experience on memory techniques…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This was way too simple for him.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He directly sent the secret scripture with his experiences over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received Literari Star’s red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Secret Scripture of Literari Star’s Photographic Memory x1.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that the daoist friend had received the red packet, Literari Star also sent another message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I wonder if the school report can be returned to me now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Naturally.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen sent Literari Star the school report.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>LIterari Star received your red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your intimacy level with Literari Star increased by 100. Current intimacy level: 200.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Intimacy level leveled up. Current intimacy level: Trusted.</span></p>
