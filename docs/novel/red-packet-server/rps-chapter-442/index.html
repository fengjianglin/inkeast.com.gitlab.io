 <p><span style>Chapter 442 – Nezha’s Command Seal</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the Immortality Peach Garden.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy put her hands on her waist and glared. Third Prince Nezha stood beside her, while a hint of confusion surfaced on his moe face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Immortality Peach-jiejie, what happened?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you asking me what happened!?” Immortality Peach Fairy pouted angrily. “Sky Sovereign Nameless asked you for help earlier, why did you refuse?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I had no choice. My dad’s going to hit me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha frowned pitifully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Immortality Peach Fairy turned around and ignored him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha immediately felt a bit worried when he saw this, “Immortality Peach-jiejie.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t you always tell me that you’ve grown up? But you’re actually scared of your dad hitting you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am grown up!” A hint of anger surfaced on Nezha’s shota face. Then he twitched his mouth. “Isn’t it just helping Sky Sovereign slay demons? I’ll help, since my dad can’t beat me anyways.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wrinkled his nose and snatched over the phone…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, count me in for slaying demons and defending justice. If you need help, then just come to me directly. Oh yeah… In order to prevent any unforeseen events…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A red packet immediately appeared on Ye Zichen’s phone after Nezha sent the message.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why is this little fellow sending me a red packet for?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows and clicked on the red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Command Seal x1.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was completely stunned when he saw the message. </span><i><span style>Third Prince Nezha actually sent me his command seal?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen frantically clicked into the Treasure Chest…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Command Seal: Third Prince Nezha’s Command Seal. This item can allow the holder to command the soldiers of the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This really is Nezha’s command seal.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Did this kid go mad? He actually sent his command seal over.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, this is my command seal. If my dad doesn’t let me help you, then just use my command seal to order the soldiers. The Heavenly Court’s soldiers will recognize the command seal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha typed the message as he wrinkled his nose, while he sneaked a few peeks over at Immortality Peach Fairy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was truly stunned by the little fellow. He purely wanted to trick the little fellow over to his side. He never even considered asking for the command seal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen replied with a wry smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Third Prince Nezha looked up proudly and handed the phone over to Immortality Peach Fairy…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy received the phone. Since she was watching on the side, she naturally saw that the child sent his command seal out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment he got the phone, she typed out a message on the phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign-ge, Nezha’s still young… That command seal…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won’t use it recklessly,” Ye Zichen replied sincerely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s good. Nezha’s personality is still rather childlike. I’ll chat to you later. He’s asking me to play ball again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, then go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen left the chat, then blanked out as he looked at the command seal within the Treasure Chest. </span><i><span style>If I can actually get to the Heavenly Court, then can I really get a bunch of Heavenly Soldiers from the Heavenly Court with this command seal?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>If this is the ancient times, then I will also be a general with a lot of power, right?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Kid, what are you doing?” Taibai Jinxing moved over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his head and glanced at him, then clicked open Red Packet Server to check the chat history…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How are you doing over there?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, they are all some guys that just want to stay out of it. There doesn’t seem to be many that are truly willing to come to our side, but Old Li and Leizhenzi seems to be willing to help,” Taibai Jinxing replied softly. Although he has already left the Heavenly Court, the only way he had to gain help was through his old friends in the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although it was a bit selfish, he was doing it for the good of his old friends as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If they were able to end the war in the Modern Realm’s Otherworld, then it would prevent the flames of war from spreading to the Three Realms. In a place like the Three Realms were beings of all kinds, the demon race will only attack even fiercer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t think about how I did. I didn’t see you help me fudge with them. What did you go off to do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Me?” Ye Zichen handed his phone over and pointed at Nezha’s command seal on the screen. “It seems like I had slightly more progress than you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“?” Taibai Jinxing received the phone in confusion. Then, when he saw the command seal within the Treasure Chest…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you insane!?” Taibai Jinxing nearly jumped up with a shout, then threw the phone back to Ye Zichen. “You actually told Nezha to give you his command seals. Just how brave are you!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you worried for…” Ye Zichen twitched his mouth at Taibai Jinxing and raised his eyebrows as he looked at the command seal. “Nezha proactively gave it to me. He has already told me clearly that he would help. He only sent his command seal over to me to prevent some unforeseen situations from happening.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is messed up, it’s all messed up,” Taibai Jinxing continuously shook his head and mumbled. After a while, he let out a long sigh after he finally calmed down. “It was fortunate that he send it to you. If he sent it to anyone else, them the Heavenly Court would be in huge trouble. Nezha’s command over the soldiers is only second to Yang Jian’s in the Heavenly Court. If someone with ulterior motives got it, then the consequences are unimaginably dire!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shook his head and sighed when he felt the worry from Taibai Jinxing’s tone.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This stubborn geezer. Even though he clearly said that he wouldn’t mind the Heavenly Court’s business anymore, he’s still thinking about it!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>In the end, he does have feelings for the Heavenly court after working there for several hundred thousand years.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen patted Taibai Jinxing’s shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Taibai Jinxing also squinted his eyes and replied, “The situation right now seems slightly more favorable for us. With Yang Jian and Nezha’s forces, and the shitty monkey’s monkeys from Mount Huaguo, we might actually be able to fight the demons.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You really counted Nezha’s forces? I can’t go to the Heavenly Court, and you also left the Heavenly Court…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you an idiot?” Taibai Jinxing rolled his eyes speechlessly. “Just send the command seal over to Yang Jian when we need to use it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s true!” Ye Zichen scratched his head and smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The main problem right now is we don’t know how strong the demon realm’s strongest fighting forces are. If we fight, then we only have the shitty monkey as a high-level fighting force. Then again, although other people don’t know about the demon race’s strength, I do. I refuse to believe that they have no Immortal King-level experts,” Taibai Jinxing squinted his eyes. He, who has been through the Great War of Gods and Demons, knew the true strength of the demon race all too well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Back then, even the demon race’s soldiers of the lowest level were complete-stage Human Immortal experts. The fact that even the lowest level abyssals reached the Human Immortal level truly made the demon race… terrifyingly strong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm, we truly don’t have much high-level fighting force right now,” Ye Zichen nodded. Ignoring everything else, and just talk about Su Yiyun. Su Yiyun’s strength is at least of a complete stage Human Immortal, or even an early-stage Sky Immortal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, Ye Zichen has heard that the demon realm has a Lord Black Dragon…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s very troublesome,” Taibai Jinxing sighed, then raised his eyebrows. “Help me contact someone. It’s that man with a scar on his face I saw in the Otherworld. I have some things I want to discuss with him!”</span></p>
