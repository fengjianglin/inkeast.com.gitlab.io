 <p><span style>Chapter 295 – The Sky Sovereign’s Rage</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within a certain high-class mansion in Bingcheng…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The living room swirled with dense smoke. Huo Da was dressed in bathrobes, as he smashed the expensive bottles of wine on the table to pieces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The bright red wine was split all over the ground like blood…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master, we, the Huo family, are incomparable to back then. This kick of yours cost us five hundred thousand,” the elder in butler clothing raised his eyebrows as he ordered some servants to come over to clean it up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huo Da twitched his mouth coldly and glared with red eyes, then snorted, “We might have fallen, but the Huo family has not fallen to the point that we have to worry about five hundred thousand. What’s more, I came to Bingcheng to turn the tables. As long as I control Xiao Yumei, I will make those families that are kicking us when we’re down to come and beg me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master is right,” the old butler nodded with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yu betrayed us. How do you think he should be dealt with,” Huo Da calmed his anger down after a long time, then raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Naturally, he cannot be used anymore,” the old butler smiled softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, but I can’t let people who betray me end well. Find a chance to kill Yu off, and if it’s possible kill the girl called Lingling off first to make him feel worse than death!” Huo Da clenched his first tightly with a menacing look on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood,” the old butler nodded and maintained his smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm, I’m not worried if I leave that to you. Oh yeah, did you fully research about that grandson, Ye Zichen’s, family?” Huo Da squinted his eyes. Although he was above these sorts of things in the past, he had been placed in a desperate position.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since the Huo family was falling, they needed a chance to completely turn the tables.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was definitely his greatest obstacle, and in order remove the obstacle, he was willing to pay any price.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not yet!” said the old butler.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Still not yet?” Huo Da frowned. “Bingcheng is damn tiny. I’ve told you to start searching from the capital, you still didn’t find them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No!” The old butler shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Creak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huo Da clenched his fist tightly. If it had been anyone else, Huo Da would have already started to curse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the person in front of him was not a mere butler, so he would only helplessly endure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Deal with it quickly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood,” the old butler nodded with a smile. “Then Young Master, stay here and rest, I’m going out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm!” Huo Da waved his hand impatiently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the old butler also turned around and… revealed a meaningful smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Back at Ye Zichen’s mansion, he laid down on his bed, and contacted the God of Fortune before doing anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the God of Fortune was having fun playing Landlord. When he heard his phone buzz on the table, he immediately put down the cards and opened up WeChat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His phone showed that there were several tens of unread messages in his chat with the Sky Sovereign.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“God of Fortune!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“God of Fortune!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“God of Fortune!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the messages shouted his name.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, it’s your turn.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ones playing the God of Fortune with was some of his subsidiary staff. Recently, he left quite poorly against Erlang Shen and co., so he decided to play a bit with his staff members to get them to lose a bit to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the staff were not understanding at all, and won seven to eight thousand gold ingots from him alongside several tens of cultivation experience.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait a moment, I’m busy here!” He rolled his eyes at the staff, then lowered his own status as he wrote his reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great deity, I’m here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The title given to him when he became a god was the God of Fortune, but the one talking to him was a real God of Fortune.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That person definitely earned tons with Yue Lao, the number one agent, selling mysterious food in the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I gave you two hundred thousand cultivation experience last time and told you to destroy the capital’s Huo family. How is that coming along?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The God of Fortune paused for a moment, then shouted at his staff, “How is it going with the capital’s Huo family?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s all done. Recently, the Huo family should not have any luck with money. They are currently losing money,” the staff replied softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The God of Fortune nodded, then relayed the words to Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Losing money? So they are not completely destroyed?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, you might not understand the structure of syndicates in the Modern Realm. The Huo family could originally be described as a huge entity in the Modern Realm. It was rich to the point that their wealth could match countries. Even though we, the ones in charge of fortune, did some work on them, some time is needed to fullywreck the Huo family. But don’t worry, the Huo family is currently losing money for an indefinite amount of time…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The God of Fortune replied with a soft smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen squinted his eyes, then directly sent a voice message to the God of Fortune.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t care if it is a huge entity, I only want results. I’m not satisfied with the results you have showed me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A loud thundering sound sounded out from the hall the God of Fortune resided in. Then, Ye Zichen’s ice-cold voice resonated from all around the celestial hall.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The God of Fortune and his two subordinate staff stood up.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Voice transmission from the sky. And even more terrifyingly, even I, who owns a celestial manor, am unable to find the origin of the voice.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Gulp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The God of Fortune silently gulped. </span><i><span style>As expected of the Sky Sovereign, he is not someone a small deity like me can compare up to.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Please be at ease, Sky Sovereign!” The God of Fortune replied frantically. “I will deal with the capital’s Huo family’s matters as soon as possible!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Beep.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A voice message appeared on Ye Zichen’s screen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he listened to it, he snorted coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmph!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A cold snort sounded out around the God of Fortune’s celestial hall. The God of Fortune could feel his blood boil in his body, causing him to nearly cough up blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I await your good news.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a long time, the God of Fortune finally suppressed his annoyance, then glanced at the two staff who did not know what had happened, “Did you feel the Sky Sovereign’s anger just now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!” The two staff nodded with at him with a tremble.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then hurry and deal with it!’ The God of Fortune shouted and slammed the table. “One week, if I don’t see the results in one week, then never return!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That caused the two staff members to leave frantically.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did the God of Fortune sit down on the table with a sigh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, the Sky Sovereign’s rage resonated in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sky Sovereign Nameless has always been a mysterious existence in the Heavenly Court, even thought everyone knew that the title of Sky Sovereign was not something that just anyone could possess.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, some people still looked down on the Sky Sovereign!</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the God of Fortune was able to feel the Sky Sovereign’s anger already.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>As I expected, the Sky Sovereign’s strength is incomparable.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen chucked his phone angrily to the side. </span><i><span style>If it really was like the God of Fortune had said, it would take some time to wreck the Huo family.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Then Yu’s words back then might very well be true.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But who would that person be?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Ye Zichen was getting confused, Liu Qing stretched lazily and exited the Dragon Eye. Due to needing to revive her soon, Ye Zichen had asked her to stay within the Dragon Eye to nurture her soul.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young man, it’s been a while,” Liu Jing greeted him with a giggle. Since she had been nurturing her soul within the Dragon Eye recently, it caused her to be much more energetic, and it even seemed to have made her body develop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young lady, it’s been a while.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen waved his hand with a soft smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing smiled sweetly, glanced at the phone by the bed and ran over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I haven’t read it for a few days, I have to hurry to catch up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen wanted to retort a bit, but the girl immediately chucked him the phone after gripping it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So annoying, why does someone look for you whenever I take your phone?”</span></p>
