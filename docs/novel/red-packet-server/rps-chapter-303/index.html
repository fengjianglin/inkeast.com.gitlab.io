 <p><span style>Chapter 303 – Spiritual Consciousness is Naked!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke held Ye Zichen’s hand with an extremely nervous expression, while the bone ring shimmered from the moment she touched it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you someone of the dragon race?” The voice of an ancient dragon suddenly sounded out in Ye Zichen’s mind, while his consciousness suddenly appeared in a place devoid of everything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A huge dragon around a hundred yards long with its entire body as red as blood laid beside a shimmering mountain of gold and jewels.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The white dragon whiskers fluttered in the air, while Ye Zichen couldn’t help but float over the moment the blood dragon spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he got near the dragon, Ye Zichen finally understood what it meant to be puny.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To it, Ye Zichen was as puny as an insect. As he looked up, he saw the blood-colored eyes look at him with a hint of softness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t have the blood of a dragon, why are you able to awaken my soul?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Dragon race?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Awaken!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, Ye Zichen remembered what Lil’ White had said earlier. </span><i><span style>This ring is called the Dragon God Ring, and it contained the soul of a dragon god from that age.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>The person who awakened it wasn’t me, it was Xia Keke!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke was a golden dragon, a member of the dragon race.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The one who awoke you was not me. There is a descendent of the Azure Dragon of the Four Sacred Beasts beside me. Her original form is that of a golden dragon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So it’s that girl!” The dragon god nodded humanely and smiled. “Summoning you both in here is too dangerous in this place. How about this, hurry up and take her to a safe please. Remember, do it as quick as possible. There is a limited amount of time for me to stay awake!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The void of consciousness shattered, and Ye Zichen also exited from the void.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen! Ye Zichen!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke’s face was filled with anxiousness as she looked at Ye Zichen, whose gaze had turned blank.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Keke, come with me!” Ye Zichen grabbed Xia Keke and immediately ran into the hotel beside him. Right when he finished registering and getting a room, he bumped into Su Qihu, who was escorting Huo Da out, on the way to the elevator.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s face stiffened.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why am I so unfortunate? I just had to bump into him at this very moment.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye ZIchen quickly let go of Xia Keke’s hand and scratched his head with a coy smile, “Uncle Su, thank you for your hard work!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he completely forgot that the hand he scratched his head with still held the hotel’s room key.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe… Not at all. I didn’t work as hard as you!” Su Qihu revealed a cold smile. He already knew that Ye Zichen had other women, but he had just never seen them before.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This is great, I caught him in the act. What’s more…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>They just got a room!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Look at what you’re saying, how can I have worked as hard as you,” Ye Zichen continued to smile coyly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Qihu wanted to get his soldiers to capture the brat in front of him to teach him a lesson. However, he suddenly had a different idea.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It really is an achievement for you to capture the criminal. By putting yourself in danger, you were valiant, it is worthy of praise! How about this, come with me to the military region, I’ll give you a certificate…” Su Qihu smiled warmly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need, no need, helping the people is my duty!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It seems like dad-in-law didn’t notice?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen licked his lips and put down his hand, “Hurry up and go back, the forces behind this brat is huge, you’re going to get a lot of work to do!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm, then I’m going back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su QIhu nodded slightly, then departed with his soldiers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, at the moment they exited the hotel, he turned to one of the soldiers, “Watch the brat closely and inform me if there’s any situation!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Phew.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen let out a long sigh of relief when Su Qihu finally left.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s so fortunate that this dad-in-law didn’t notice anything. If he knew that I was getting a room with Xia Keke, even if we weren’t doing anything, he would definitely beat me up real good with his temper.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Who was that person?” Xia Keke asked in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Su Yan’s dad!” Ye Zichen replied with a light smile, before grabbing Xia Keke’s hand and running into the elevator.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even when they eventually reached the room, Xia Keke’s face was still covered in shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That person is actually Su Yan’s dad!? He’s a military commander? Why did she never mention it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You know Su Yan, she likes keeping a low profile,” Ye Zichen replied with a soft smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since you know her dad, then he should know about your relationship with Su Yan, right? Are you sure it's fine?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why wouldn’t it be? We didn’t do anything?” Ye Zichen shrugged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke responded with a blush, “We didn’t do anything just now, but are we not going to do anything later?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why am I actually seeing a hint of anticipation from her face?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could it just be my mind acting up? I was bullied pretty terribly the last time we got a room together.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen scratched his head. </span><i><span style>I must maintain my proper image, and the old dragon god had also said that its time was limited.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t think too much about it. I brought you here for the ring!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke’s expression immediately tensed, “Oh yeah, where did you get the ring? Can you give the ring to me? It is very important to me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t be in such a hurry, let me take you to see a guy… Wait, no, a dragon!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen begun to mentally shout…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The space in Ye Zichen’s consciousness opened once again, while the ancient dragon god glanced at Ye Zichen, “It’s safe now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm!” Ye Zichen nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, Xia Keke also appeared in his consciousness, “What is this place?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke, who just arrived, looked around. Just as Ye Zichen was about to answer, he found his eyes glued to something…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Special!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>This is my see of consciousness, and only a soul’s consciousness can enter…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Which… is naturally naked!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Gulp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen silently gulped and tried his best to move his gaze elsewhere, but his eyes were completely glued on Xia Keke and would not bulge at all.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Two members of the opposite sex could be extremely close together and act completely natural!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had once scoffed at the story and thought that he could do it as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He felt like he truly overestimated himself!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, why aren’t you speaking!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke turned around in confusion. Yet, when she saw the naked Ye Zichen…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahh…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She immediately slapped him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pervert! Why aren’t you wearing any clothes!” Xia Keke covered her eyes with her hands, but let a gap in between her fingers to peek curiously!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Erm…” Ye Zichen smiled coyly. “You didn’t notice it, but you are naked too!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke put down her hands and looked down, then instantly froze!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A split second later, Xia Keke’s high pitched scream sounded out in the empty void.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No looking!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won’t, I won’t!” Ye Zichen quickly shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the dragon god, who was lying by the golden mountain couldn’t suffer through it anymore and said helplessly, “Can you two not act like that? This old one doesn’t have much time!”</span></p>
