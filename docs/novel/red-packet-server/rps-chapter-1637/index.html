<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>The Six Demons were the former Demon Emperor’s trusted confidants. As his six great commanders, they were completely loyal to him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Word in the streets had it that, given another hundred thousand years, the former Demon Emperor could have relied upon his all-encompassing power and the Six Demons to unite all three Upper Realms.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The demons truly were itching for war, and it truly seemed as if they’d suppress the other two races.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, good times don’t last forever. The former Demon Emperor disappeared mysteriously, and the Six Demons disappeared with him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Demon Emperor Kui Lin had taken the throne and held it with the support of a few Divine Demon Generals. Only then did he stabilize the chaotic Demon Realm. However, the inner conflict leading up to that meant that they could no longer recover the glory they’d had during the former Demon Emperor’s reign.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Red Demon’s appearance made quite a few others think that, now that the era was ending, the former Demon Emperor was preparing to return.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>No one would have expected Red Demon to say that he was here to avenge his former master!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Didn’t that mean that the rumors were true, and that the former Demon Emperor really had been assassinated? And that his followers, the Six Demons, had died in battle?</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Red Demon didn’t care what his words made those present in the room think; he’d never cared about that sort of thing. If he had something to say, he said it.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He had indeed come here for the purpose of obtaining good fortune and avenging the former Demon Emperor.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Revenge?” The former God Emperor’s remnant soul muttered. Although Red Demon’s words had shaken everyone else in the room, they knew that this wouldn’t matter at all to this remnant.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But to everyone’s surprise, the soul fragment actually….</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Then do you know who you shall exact your revenge upon? I can assist you.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Everyone present went solemn. Even Red Demon would never have guessed that this soul fragment would say such a thing. After a brief, stunned pause, he snorted and shook his head. His entire body emanated a murderous aura so intense, it pricked and stung those around him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“No need. I know what I’m doing.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Red Demon was already keenly aware of who he needed to get revenge upon. His gaze flitted vaguely in Kui Lin’s direction. No one could sense how much murderous intent was hidden in his seemingly cool, indifferent gaze.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The others couldn’t sense it, at least. However, Kui Lin, as one directly involved, could.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Red Demon knew what had happened then too!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>If that were the case, then it was even more important that he didn’t leave Red Demon alive. He had to think of a way to solve this within the mausoleum. If he let Red Demon leave this place alive, this would inevitably become even more troublesome and difficult to resolve.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Then I wish you success.” The former God Emperor’s remnant soul chuckled, then addressed Red Demon no longer. Actually, from beginning to end, they’d only exchanged a few sentences.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the space within the hidden room shook violently.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Everyone was terrified, but then, the narrow, oppressively cramped space transformed into a veritable paradise.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A gentle stream flowed through a land of lush vegetation, beautiful flowers, and birdsong.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It was hard to find a comparable paradise even if you searched all three Upper Realms.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“What a paradise.” Even the likes of the Ocean Emperor couldn’t help but exclaim. The great emperors were of lofty status, but that only made it even harder for them to relax.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This paradise seemed to contain a magical power. Just standing here, their taut nerves relaxed despite themselves, and their former troubles seemed to vanish in a puff of smoke. All they wanted to do now was remain here and live out their days in bliss.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But that wasn’t all. This concentration of spiritual power and proximity to the dao was far greater here than in the outside world.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Although just about everyone here was an imperial expert, at their level, each step forward was harder than ascending the heavens. Yet, standing here now, they were certain that so long as they remained here, in less than half a month, the shackles holding them back would disappear.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Quite a few people already sensed that this place was extraordinary, so they seized every possible second and sat cross-legged on the ground in an attempt to gain enlightenment.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Quite a few others already seemed to be enjoying themselves over by the stream. Their eyes shone with unprecedented peaceful amiability.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“What’s the meaning of all this? Why make this for us?” Yang Jian wasn’t particularly interested in this place. Yes, the scenery was very pleasing; he couldn’t deny that. But he’d lived in the Heavenly Palace. Although it was part of a lower plane of existence, its scenery was undoubtedly even more exquisite than this.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This place was at most a pleasing, pastoral scene. It lacked the immortal air of the Heavenly palace.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Zichen said nothing. He simply surveyed his surroundings silently. He didn’t recklessly wander about, nor did he sit down and attempt to gain enlightenment.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“How about it? The former God Emperor’s abilities are impressive, no?” Gu Li walked over, a grin on his face. He wasn’t acting like the others and raving on about how this was a paradise either. His tone was even rather playful. He clearly had a lot of insider information. Before even entering the mausoleum, the Outsider Gu Li must have told him many details about this place.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“What do you mean by that?” asked Ye Zichen.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Everyone here came in search of transcendence, but look at them now… Are even thirty percent of them still focused on obtaining that good fortune?” Gu Li looked around, his gaze unreadable. “That’s not all; they’ve relaxed their guard completely. They’ve stopped tracking even basic precautions. If someone acted up suddenly, none of them would escape.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Are you saying the former God Emperor’s remnant soul wants us to kill each other?” Ye Zichen frowned.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“No, you’re reading too much into things. That was just an example,” said Gu Li.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The way Ye Zichen saw it, the remnant soul wouldn’t do such a thing. The era was nearing its end, and the Transcendent Mausoleum existed to give them hope of survival. Those present were all peak experts of the Upper Three Realms. If the remnant soul had them kill each other, when the giant era destroying beasts attacked, who would be left to fight them off?&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But then, the remnant soul also ought to be aware of why they’d come here. And yet, he’d taken them here instead of directly to the palace interior.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Or was this perhaps the palace interior?</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“What exactly is the former god emperor’s remnant soul thinking?” Ye Zichen couldn’t help but mutter to himself.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“He’s trying to whittle the group down,” said Gu Li, drawing closer to Ye Zichen. Who knew when their relationship had gotten so close? “At a time like this, we need someone to stand up and ask what’s going on. If I’m not mistaken, it’ll most likely be that Red Demon guy. Right, speaking of Red Demon, I almost forgot. Have you made any progress with the former Demon Emperor?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Zichen suddenly froze up completely. A moment before, he and Gu Li practically had their arms around each other’s shoulders, but now, he took several steps back and watched Gu Li on high alert. Only his closest friends and Ocean Emperor Xue Yang were supposed to know about the former Demon Emperor. Why was Gu Li in the know too?</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Seems I said something I shouldn’t.” Gu Li laughed and shrugged.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Just as Gu Li pressed his lips into a grin, just as the crowd was immersed in this peaceful paradise, a deeply disharmonious voice broke them out of their reverie. Just as Gu Li predicted, it was Red Demon. The old man’s aura was murderous, and his eyes were wide with fury. “Are you playing with us?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This thunderous roar made everyone’s hearts shake, regardless of whether they were meditating or admiring the flowers.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“We’re here in search of transcendence, not to relax!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Is this place not to your liking?” The remnant soul’s ethereal voice filled the air.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Red Demon looked over the lush landscape, his gaze sharp. “What’s there to like about it?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This is a paradise I used my life essence to create. It has far richer spiritual energy than the outside world, and it contains the enlightenment I accumulated over the course of my lifetime. So long as you’re willing to calm your heart here, you still have the possibility of transcendence. Furthermore, it’ll be far easier than it would be in the palace interior.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I’m concerned about the enders! The Second Era’s failed to transcend. I’m unwilling to watch this tragedy play itself out again in the Third Era. I’m doing this entirely out of concern for you, yet now, you’re questioning me? Sit down and contemplate the dao! Isn’t that better than facing almost certain death in the palace interior?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The remnant soul’s forceful response made numerous experts nod thei agreement. It seemed the remnant soul really was looking out for their best interest.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But curiously enough, those standing on the remnant souls were the same people who’d immersed themselves in the beauty of this landscape.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Red Demon said nothing. He simply looked up into the sky, his determination written in his gaze.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Of all those who’d come in search of fortune, Red Demon was the only one who’d come this far entirely on his own. It was precisely because he was on his own that no one attempted to persuade him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Quite a few people, in their hearts, stood with the remnant soul. They wanted to say something, but when the considered that the dissenter was Red Demon, they could only force the words back down.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“What a stubborn person.” The sky suddenly distorted, and soon, a wisp of soul came into view for all to see.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The soul’s eyes blazed with fury. From this, it was clear that this was none other than the remnant of the former God Emperor’s soul who’d been arguing with Red Demon.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Greetings, Senior.” Everyone present, regardless of whether they were human, yao, or demon, bowed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, the soul fragment reacted as if he hadn’t seen them. He simply floated directly up to Red Demon. “You’ve rejected a path to life in favor of a road that leads to death. If you go into the palace interior, you have a ninety percent chance of dying. Have you thought this through?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The remnant soul’s brow was furrowed with anger, as if he’d never seen someone so stubborn before.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He’d done this out of the goodness of his heart, going to great lengths, yet this Red Demon refused to listen even when life and death were on the line.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“So what?” Red Demon didn’t care in the slightest.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Truly stubborn and intractable!” The fragment swung his arm in fury, then looked at the others. “Do you plan to follow his example? If so, don’t blame me for not warning you first! If you enter the palace interior, even an imperial sovereign is unlikely to return alive!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Senior, we’d like to take a look around the palace interior too.” Gu Li suddenly cupped his fist.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When the others fell silent, Gu Li spoke up. Red Demon couldn’t help but take another look at him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The soul fragment narrowed his eyes, as if furious that yet another blind, foolish brat had appeared.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Then, his gaze swept around once more. Finally, he looked away and nodded. “Fine. Since you’re willing to rush to your deaths, I won’t stop you.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The instant his words rung out, the space split in two.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Once was the secluded paradise, while the other was a volcanic eruption. Lava burst forth, flames descended from the heavens, and lightning crackled overhead.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Even standing in paradise, the experts could sense the danger of the other space. Especially the waves of heat emanating from the lava; just looking at it struck terror into their hearts.&nbsp;</p>
