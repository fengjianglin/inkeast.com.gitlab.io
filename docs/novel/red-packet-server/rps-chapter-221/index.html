 <p><span style>Chapter 221 – Mystery of his Background</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s to be curious about my background?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I never had a father, and mom had raised me all by herself. I grew up in a family that couldn’t be more normal. It could be said that I have no actual background at all…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>However, those words sounded a bit different from Elder Lin’s mouth. He had frequent contact with people from that place, and from the looks of his gaze, it seems like he knows something.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Elder Lin, just say it directly,” Ye Zichen’s eyes held a hint of nervousness. Old Man Lin merely replied with one sentence, but it was enough to cause Ye Zichen’s expression to change drastically.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Back in his own mansion, Ye Rong washed fruits with a joyous expression as usual, while Ye Zichen sat on the sofa in a clearly down mood, as he continuously wrote out two characters on the sofa with his finger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>叶 (Ye).</span></p>
 <p><span style>古 (Gu).</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it wasn’t for Elder Lin, he might never have thought about this.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The character Ye was the character Gu if you rotated it by ninety degrees.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chinese characters are truly deep.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Pant, pant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ White rubbed its head at his leg.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his hand and rubbed its head, “What do you want to say to me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ White glanced towards the kitchen sink, then jumped onto Ye Zichen’s lap and muttered, “Boss, you’ve got something on your mind?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can tell as well?” Ye Zichen patted its head, then sighed with a troubled expression. “Yeah, and it’s weighing on me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then…” Just when Lil’ White was about to speak, Ye Rong walked over with a plate of fruits and put it on the tea table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, eat some fruits.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That kind smile caused Ye Zichen’s emotions to become more complex. He had used his mother’s surname since a young age.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could my normal mother be someone of the Gu family that was one of the Hidden Families?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded with a dry smile, then used a toothpick to put a piece of apple into his mouth absentmindedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What have you been busy with recently? Why haven’t you be coming back?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then make sure you rest, don’t act so fiercely, you’re going to be in trouble if you collapse.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s absentminded situation finally caught Ye Rong’s attention.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She sat down at Ye Zichen’s said and looked at him worriedly, “Zichen, did you run into some trouble recently?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen placed the toothpick in his hand onto the tea table, then held his hands together and placed it on his lap and leaned forward to think for a long time…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mom, I want to ask you a question.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it?” Ye Rong revealed a confused expression, she was able to feel Ye Zichen’s strangeness at that moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who exactly is my father?” Ye Zichen looked up directly at Mother Ye. This question was something that had bothered him for a long time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Rong’s expression stiffened, then she revealed a wry smile and caressed his head, “Child, why did you suddenly ask about this? Haven’t we been living a decent life these years?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I just want to know,” Ye Zichen frowned. “Every time I ask you about it, you would always find an excuse, can you tell me this time…?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Silence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled wryly and shook his head the moment this feeling appeared.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It is far too familiar.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Regardless of when he asked Mother Ye regarding news of his father, Mother Ye would always deal with it using this sort of silence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a long time, Ye Zichen looked up and smiled, “Alright, I won’t ask anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, it’s not that mom isn’t telling you, it’s that…” Ye Rong revealed a troubled expression. “Mom has some difficulties.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I understand, I’ll just not ask anymore,” With that, Ye Zichen’s expression suddenly turned serious. “Then can you tell me what is the relationship between our family and the Gu family?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Instantly…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Ye Rong heard the question, her expression drastically changed. This intense change of mood was even more severe than when Ye Zichen asked who his father was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you talking about? What Gu family?” After a long while, Mother Ye finally sorted out her mood, and smiled as if she didn’t know what Ye Zichen was talking about.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you telling the truth?” Ye Zichen stared straight into Mother Ye’s eyes. He could feel that his mother was hiding something from the look in her eyes…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mom doesn’t know what you’re talking about. I’m a bit tired, so I’m going back to rest,” With that, Ye Rong stood up from the sofa and hurriedly walked upstairs without saying anything else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen didn’t say anything for a long time as he watched his mother walk away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Lil’ White jumped onto his lap and licked his hand, “Boss.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stay here properly, I’m a bit tired, so I’m going to rest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen dragged his tired body back into his room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was very tired.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His heart was very tired.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen laid on the bed and looked at the ceiling. If there was no surprise, his mother definitely knew about the Gu clan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Judging from her expression, they didn’t have a normal relationship at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen habitually took out his phone and clicked on the WeChat app…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ten-odd messages from Erlang Shen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Several tens of messages from the Canopy Marshal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Several messages from Third Prince Nezha.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ten-odd messages from Great Sage Sun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Taibai Jinxing left a message for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, people also continuously @’d him in the Heavenly Court’s WeChat group.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why’s going on? Why did I suddenly become so popular?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Then he looked at the 99+ friend requests in his contact list and the friend request messages…</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were all cursing him!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The hell? What’s going on?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at the deities, who were cursing him, in shock. </span><i><span style>Just what did I do to actually make these deities gang up on me?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Han Xiangzi also sent a message over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Congrats, congratz!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the hell?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Something was definitely up since even the Eight Immortals knew about it.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen frowned, then replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I wonder what Brother Han is congratulating me for? This sovereign did not have any sort of happy business!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within the Eight Immortals Palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Iron Crutch Li, Lü Dongbin and the rest of the Eight Immortals sat in a circle and gossiped about the stuff they heard from their friends with interest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Xiangzi, who was part of it, couldn’t help but smile when he saw the message on his phone, “Sky Sovereign Nameless is actually playing dumb with me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm, this is normal,” Iron Crutch Li smiled like someone who has been through it all. “Fairy Chang’e’s immortal heart has never once been moved after Houyi. It is normal for Sky Sovereign Nameless to want to hide it after actually getting into a relationship with the fairy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah,” Lan Caihe held his basket and glance towards Immortal Lady He. “Didn’t you and Immortal Lady He only tell us the truth when you couldn’t hide it anymore?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lan Caihe!” Immortal Lady He frowned. At this moment, she still had a shiny diamond ring around her ring finger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Xiangzi merely laughed idiotically towards this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lü Dongbin sent a message towards Ye Zichen using this chance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, stop hiding it, everyone knows.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s phone vibrated again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Ye ZIchen was sitting in a car as he read the other messages the other celestial friends sent him. All of them had some random words of congratulations, only the geezer, Taibai Jinxing, sent him a question mark.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen finished reading all the messages with a look of confusion, then when he saw Lü Dongbin’s message, he got even more confused.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Stop hiding it!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the heck did I hide?</span></i></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Original Chapter Teaser:</b>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Dear Diary,</p>
 <p>Today was a weird day. Why did Old Man Lin ask me about my background? Honestly, what's so curious about it?</p>
 <p>It's nothing special. I was raised in a single-parent family that could not be any more normal. My mom and I aren't very well off, in fact, we had always just been able to get by. I suppose, if there was anything special about my background, it would be my dad. The dad that my mom never talked about, the one that had abandoned us.</p>
 <p>Gu (古).</p>
 <p>Ye (叶).</p>
 <p>If Old Man Lin never pointed this out for me, I never would have noticed. The Ye character is merely the Gu character turned 90 degrees clockwise.</p>
 <p>Now, that comes the question, just what the hell is our relationship to the Gu family?</p>
