 <p><span style>Chapter 141 – Do me a favor</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen opened his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A scene of pure white entered his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pain from his chest had already disappeared. When he thought back to the scene back then…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why did laozi vomit blood?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re awake?” a soft laugh rang out beside his ear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen turned his head, and saw Lin Xiyue, who was still in her police uniform, sitting at the side of his bed looking at him with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you here?” Ye Zichen sat up and looked at her with a look of confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From what he remembered, he fainted when he vomited blood…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You bumped into me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you think?” Lin Xiyue said with a look that seemed to be hiding something. “If it wasn’t for me bumping into you, you might have been eaten by a wild dog.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>This woman’s mouth was so deadly, why didn’t he notice it before?</span></p>
 <p><span style>After chatting for a while, Ye Zichen asked as if he suddenly thought of something, “Is Liu Qiang still in your hands?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, he has already been handed to the Ministry of Justice already. If there are no surprises…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Xiyue did not finish her sentence, but Ye Zichen already knew that Liu Qiang would most likely spend the rest of his life in prison.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then Zhao Ziming…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He knew that Zhao Ziming is Lin Xiyue’s boyfriend, but Ye Zichen just feel like that sort of man wasn’t a good choice for her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I feel like you should break up with him quickly…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then who am I supposed to be with after breaking up with him? You?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s alright too!” Ye Zichen smiled, then raised his arm to flex his biceps. “Actually I’m pretty capable!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Be serious,” Lin Xiyue rolled her eyes and sighed softly. “My relationship with Zhao Ziming isn’t as simple as you think. It isn’t possible for us to break up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, she lifted her wrist to look at the time with a smile, “I got the hospital to do a check up for you just now, but they didn’t find anything. I’m not your family, so I won’t accompany you overnight here!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hmm?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What did that sound so weird?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows and revealed a playful smile, “Staying overnight doesn’t require you to be a family member, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what… You…” Lin Xiyue blushed, then cursed with eyes with a hint of rage, “You! Go! And! Die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Xiyue grabbed a pillow on the bed and chucked it towards Ye Zichen’s head, before walking out of the medical ward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That police girl,” Ye Zichen couldn’t help but smile, then looked at the time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two in the morning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That female officer had been taking care of you until now,” Liu Qing, who sat on the other side of Ye Zichen said softly. “You have to thank her when you have time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know,” Ye Zichen rubbed Liu Qing’s little head, while his heart was filled with confusion.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why did he feel a sudden pain in his chest, causing him to vomit blood then?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could he have a hidden illness? But he had never had any kind of diseases since he was young, and Lin Xiyue had said that the checkup didn’t find anything.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>After finding himself unable to understand it for a long while, Ye Zichen licked his lips and jumped down from the bed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you going to do!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go home. Do you want me to stay in the hospital? I can’t stand this place,” With that, Ye Zichen arched his back and ran outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Friend Ye, you’re awake?” An old man walked out from the corner of the corridor when Ye Zichen nearly reached the elevator.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Deng Cheng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen felt a bit speechless when he saw this old man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was clearly an expert, why was he standing guard in the hospital in the middle of the night.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where are you going?” Deng Cheng glanced at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen frowned, “Can’t you tell? Of course I’m going home.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then did you do your discharge procedures yet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who helped me do the admittance procedures?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two stared at each other silently for a moment, before Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows, “Alright, Officer Lin helped me do them, right? Look, I helped you with out with several troubles, just help me do my discharge procedures. I’m completely fine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Deng Cheng continued to remain silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What, you’re unwilling?” Ye Zichen put his hands on his waist and spoke like an arrogant elder. “I helped you deal with two medical incidents. It could be said that I’m your savior. You should be honored helping your savior do something.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Deng Cheng continued to remain silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen felt a bit awkward due to the atmosphere. Thus, he scratched his head and patted Deng Cheng’s shoulders, “Comrade Deng Cheng, just treat it as doing me a favor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then help me do a favor as well,” Deng Cheng, who had remained silent, suddenly asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you want me to help you with? Never mind if you want me to come to the hospital to be a doctor, my interests don’t lie there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t need you to come here and be a doctor. A friend of mine will come to Bingcheng soon, I want you to take a look at him…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Me? Take a look?” Ye Zichen pointed at his nose in disbelief. “With such a senior medical titan like you here, what need do you have for a brat like me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your ability in Chinese medicine is much better than even some old people. Laddie, don’t look down on yourself.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Who’s looking down on himself? I just don’t want to help, okay?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen twitched his mouth silently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Deng Cheng spoke up once again, “I only ask you to have a look since there’s no other way, just treat it as giving face to this old man, okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh, I’ve lost. Since you told me to take a look, then I will, but don’t blame me if I can’t treat it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am beyond thankful for you doing this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen made an “ok” gesture, then waved his hand, “No problem, just find me then. You can go and find Huang Shengmei if you can’t find me. I heard that you have an empty attending physician position. She’s on pretty good terms with me. Pretty good! Oh yeah, I’ll trouble you for the matter about the discharge procedures. Remember, Huang Shengmei is on pretty good terms with me…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Deng Cheng shook his head helplessly after hearing Ye Zichen emphasis on Huang Shengmei’s name several times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The attending physician position was going to be hers anyways. It would be hers even if Ye Zihen didn’t say anything, but since he said that, there was no harm in doing him this favor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sneakily ran back home. The moment he entered the house, Lil’ White ran over excitedly with his eyes shining with a green light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, you’re hurt?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was shocked when he heard Lil’ White’s words as he turned on the lights in the mansion, “How did you know?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can see it,” With that, Lil’ White turned on his scanning eyes once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows. It seemed like these scanning eyes aren’t useless at all, they just need to be slowly developed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The heck use was being able to tell that he was hurt? It wasn’t like it could heal him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thinking that, Ye Zichen raised his hand and smacked Lil’ White’s head again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, why did you hit me again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My hand was itchy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I… Fine, boss is amazing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen chuckled when he saw Lil’ White’s troubled expression. It really was nice having such a little guy at home.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s phone vibrated as he laughed with Lil’ White.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No one sent him a message, but there was a “1” on his friend list.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Xiangzi has sent you a friend request.</span></p>
