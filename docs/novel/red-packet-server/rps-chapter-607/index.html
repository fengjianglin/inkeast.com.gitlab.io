 <p><span style>Chapter 607 – The Same Scent</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Liu’er immediately ran over and checked the two girls over after Gu Li and Su Yiyun left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ sis, did they do anything to you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No,” Su Yan shook her head, then choked up tearfully. “Sis, I was wrong.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wrong? It’s good that you’re fine,” Su Liu’er pulled Su Yan into her embrace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Lu Lu watched on for a moment, then wrapped her arms around Ye Zichen’s shoulder. “When are you marrying me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait a moment, when did I say that I would marry you?” Ye Zichen was momentarily stunned, then moved her hand away. “Don’t just say random things.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? You don’t want to marry me!?” Lu Lu frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment, the white-shirted man suddenly shouted from within the gold light, “Silence!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The surrounding people all turned silent, including Lu Lu who stuck out her tongue before doing so. Then she walked near then and raised her eyebrows, “How did they get injured like that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry about that,” Ye Zichen said indifferently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment, there were a few sounds which originated from the sky. The group looked up and saw Old Lord Taishang hurrying over with two of his disciples in tow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen revealed a look of joy on his face when he saw Old Lord Taishang. He immediately dragged the latter and walked towards the white-shirted man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After getting near them, Old Lord Taishang saw the Great Sage and Yuan Hong, who were on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They actually got injured so heavily that their origin spiritual energy is unable to restore itself anymore!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s origin spiritual energy?” Ye Zichen asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All Sky Immortal experts will be able to sense their origin. Sky Immortals can also be called undying. As long as they have enough time, they would be able to recover from any injury, no matter how severe it is,” Old Lord Taishang frowned. “But their origins have already stopped functioning. Even if I start to refine pills right now, the most I can do is help them hang on to their lives.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Lord, there is no need to worry. Hua Tuo is coming later as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the white-shield man walked out of the golden barrier of light. Old Lord Taishang glanced at him in confusion, then wrinkled his nose before looking at Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Lu also did the same.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>They smell very similar.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Little bro, we’ve arrived.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ox-Head and Horse-Face also hurried over with Hua Tuo. They didn’t mind any useless courtesy, before Hua Tuo walking into inside the barrier of golden light and reached out to the two people on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Elder Hua, how is it?” the white-shirted man asked nervously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hua Tuo squinted his eyes, “I can save them!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everybody’s expression brightened upon hearing that. Yet, that was when Hua Tuo suddenly asked, “Who wounded them like this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Demons,” the white-shirted man replied without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hua Tuo nodded, but his expression did not reveal his thoughts at all. “I need absolute silence while applying acupuncture, so please, everyone take your leave. Also, Old Lord, please refine two Nine Spirals Life-Continuation Pill, and two Three Yang Spirit Recovery Pills please. It’ll be for them after my treatment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You damn geezer, you’re actually ordering me now?” Old Lord Taishang rolled his eyes unwillingly. “Fine, I’ll refine them as soon as possible.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you,” Hua Tuo nodded, then walked within the barrier of light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since this respected elder had spoke already, the group all did as he asked, and left the back mountains.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Get me a quiet room as well,” Old Lord Taishang spoke up after leaving the back mountains.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Zhu led him away with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Ox-Head, begun to comment, “I didn’t expect the Great Sage to actually go over to the Demon Realm. Are the demons actually so strong now!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Ox-Head is right,” Horse-Face agreed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It wasn’t because the demons were too strong, it was mainly because… Never mind, telling you guys right now wouldn’t help with anything. Let’s wait for news of the Great Sage’s and Yuan Hong’s recovery instead,” the white-shirted man said, before turning towards Fatty Yin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty Yin subconsciously shrunk his neck when he felt the gaze. He was the main person responsible for the Great Sage and Yuan Hong getting into their current situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it wasn’t because he foolishly agreed to Su Liu’er’s terms, those people wouldn’t have been able to get to the Demon Realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…!” the white-shirted man shook his head, then stopped speaking, and instead walked to the side in isolation and looked up towards the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who’s that?” Ox-Head indicated towards the black-robed man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Lu immediately spoke up, “That guy smells like you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Smells like me?” Ye Zichen was surprised.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Lu had told him that everyone smelled in a unique manner back in the Modern Realm, and she had searched him out through scent.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Now she’s saying that white-shirted man smells like me?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm, instead of saying he smells like you. It’s actually better to say that the two of you smell identical. However, it’s impossible or two different people to smell the same. Perhaps my nose isn’t working quite right since I was poisoned,” Lu Lu shrugged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan immediately added, “Actually, I always wanted to say this, but this white-shirted man gives me a feeling really similar to what you make me feel.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uhm…” Ye Zichen was at a loss for words. However, he then shook his head with a smile. “Alright now, let’s ignore him. You guys need to get some rest, since you should be tired out after all that happened in the Demon Realm. Big Brother Ox-Head and Horse-Face, the two of you should be tired after escorting Elder Hua here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And you?” Su Yan asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course I’m going to rest as well. I’ll get Big Sister Su Zhu to get me a room later, so I can rest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The night fell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fires within the houses of the fox yaos burned brightly. However, perhaps Su Yan and co. were truly knackered, they did not come back out of their rooms after entering.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Ye Zichen held a bottle of Wuliangye near the back mountains and walked beside the lonely figure on the hills.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You want a sip?” Ye Zichen handed the bottle over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The white-shirted man hesitated for a moment, then accepted the bottle, and poured some liquor into his mouth. “I haven’t drank this for a long time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ve drank it before?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The white-shirted man turned silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You should be the system that’s been chatting with me, right?” Ye Zichen laid down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm,” the white-shirted man smiled. “What, you want to punch me? I do seem to recall you saying that you want to punch me several times.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whatever, I can’t beat you,” Ye Zichen shrugged, then raised his eyebrows. “Do you think I’m not going to hit you if I was about as strong as you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha…” the white-shirted man shook his head with a chuckled, then glanced back at the barrier of golden light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had already been several hours since Hua Tuo had started the acupuncture treatment. The fact that he, one of the greatest doctors ever, still wasn’t finished only went on to show just how severe Yuan Hong and the Great Sage’s injuries were.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen checked out the white-shirted man, then finally formed the question that’s been on his mind the entire time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, system. Who exactly are you?”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Original Chapter Teaser:</strong>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>In the next chapter of RPS...</p>
 <p>Su Yan and Lu Lu have returned,&nbsp;but the thread of the demons still looms over them like a&nbsp;permanent raincloud. With their strength, there really wasn't anything they could do against the one who injured the Great Sage and Yuan Hong.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, the treatment of the two monkeys continues. Hua Tuo and Old Lord Taishang respectively represent the greatest doctors in the entirety of the Three Realms, with their promise, it&nbsp;was very likely for the two monkeys to be cured. But... how long would it take?</p>
 <p>Also, what would be the first thing they do after they wake up?</p>
