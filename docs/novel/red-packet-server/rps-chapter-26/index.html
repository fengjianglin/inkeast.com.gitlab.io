 <p><span style>Chapter 26 – The Broken Marriage String</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your affability level with Su Yan has decreased by 40. Current Affability level is 0. The marriage string snapped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It actually wasn’t Xia Keke’s marriage string showing up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was a little disappointed for some unknown reason. This loli was rather good looking and her strange appearance also made people like her alot…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>No!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>That wasn’t the main point, alright?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan’s marriage string snapped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen hurriedly opened his phone’s Treasure Chest. It really was as he expected, there was only a marriage string with Xiao Yumei left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan’s marriage string had already disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just what exactly happened, why did Su Yan’s affability level with him suddenly decreased to 0?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Could she have seen Xia Keke…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen quickly searched around to find Su Yan. At this moment, on the street opposite the police station…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan stopped a taxi and got in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Su Yan…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shouted loudly, but the taxi door had already closed, and it was getting ready to drive away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Susu came?” Xia Keke, who didn’t know what happened at all, looked around. “No, I don’t see Susu, you hallucinated, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I… Su Yan saw you kiss me just now, so her affability level towards me turned to 0.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Affability level turned to 0?” Xia Keke was completely confused. Meanwhile, Ye Zichen rubbed his throbbing head, unsure of what to say.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn’t exactly tell her that he had Yue Lao’s marriage string and knew of the affability level between Su Yan and him, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Never mind, let’s go back to school.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Back at the dorm, Ye Zichen’s roommates were still fighting on Summoner’s Rift. Just after they entered the room, they invited him excitedly, only to be faced with his refusal.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Play games my ass.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>The goddess was going to leave me, okay?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He opened the chat with Yue Lao on WeChat, and directly sent a row of angry emojis.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My celestial friend, what happened?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My marriage string with Su Yan snapped. Yue Lao, can you connect us again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Allow me to go and check.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, Yue Lao sent another message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The marriage string did snap, but it only has the effect of linking you two. It snapping means that it isn’t time yet, being forceful isn’t going to end up well. I can’t exactly…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay, okay, okay, I get it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t be more annoyed. However, Yue Lao sent another message over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The treasure that celestial friend sent me is nearly gone, I wonder…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Scan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Send.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao received your red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Take it to smoke, don’t bother me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After sending Yue Lao away, Ye Zichen blanked out on the bed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He finally got linked with Su Yan with much difficulty, but it snapped so randomly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The goddess left him, just like that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Ye Zichen’s heart was in shambles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, in Su Yan’s room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke skipped into the dorm and saw Su Yan zoning out on the sofa.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Susu, what are you doing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Keke, you came back,” When Su Yan saw Xia Keke, a flash of light flashed across her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, I had been waiting for Riche Bro at the police station just now. I’m so tired.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke casually kicked away her shoes, then laid down on the bed. After rolling around the bed a bit, she asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Riche Bro said to me that he saw you at the police station. Did you go just now? Why didn’t I see you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nope,” Su Yan shook her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was saying, Riche Bro must have had a hallucination,” Xia Keke sat up and stretched, then walked and sat down in front of the computer. “I have to continue to fight. There are so many jobs that I haven’t finished.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Keke!” Just at that moment, Su Yan spoke up, but then went silent again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke looked at her in confusion. Su Yan also bit her lips and asked, “What do you think about Ye Zichen?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm,” Xia Keke blinked, then suddenly smiled. “He’s great. I feel very safe with him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that so…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing Xia Keke’s reply, Su Yan’s face suddenly turned pale, while she forced a smile.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Should I explain to Su Yan or not?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen hesitated for a long time after clicking open the chat with Su Yan. However, he didn’t manage to send anything.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Argh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rubbed his temples and frowned on the bed. After countless struggles, he chose to close the chat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So what if he explained? Explaining was hiding things.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a clear red “1” on his contact list.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clicked on it, the new friend…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Howling Celestial Dog wants to add you as a friend.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why did this dog add me!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He ignored this friend request. Yet, just at this moment, his phone vibrated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen wants to add you as a friend.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s this!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Accept.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right after he accepted, Ye Zichen received a message on his WeChat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Brat, you’re very cocky. You actually dared to force this god to wait for so long.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is he retarded?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He accepted the moment the request came through. Wait his ass.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he looked at the intimacy level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>0.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Erlang Shen sent another message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, playing dead, huh? Do you believe that I’ll not tear your home apart with the Howling Celestial Dog?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This retard is a harlot screaming on the streets!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen thought about the large-scale flame wars that he had seen in the chat before. It seem to be all initiated by Erlang Shen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it was before, Ye Zichen would definitely submit to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the goddess had just left him, so he was in a terrible mood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You got business with me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, not playing dead anymore?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just fart out whatever you have to say, stop wasting my time. This god is very busy and have no time to waste with a small fry like you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re cocky. Say your celestial title, see if laozi beats the shit out of you or not.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Say your ass.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Click.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen directly deleted him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen wants to add you as a friend.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Who cares.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Someone @’d you.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not even a minute later, Ye Zichen saw that Erlang Shen had @ him in the group.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>You piece of shit!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was instantly pissed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That grandson truly started flaming immediately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He clicked open the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: @Only Idealism, little bastard, you actually dared to delete laozi. Don’t play dead with laozi, say your celestial title!</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Erlang Shen started to flame again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mother of Lightning: Watching.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortal Peach Goddess: Aiya, I have to watch the garden. I have no time to watch this, what a shame.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jade Rabbit: Selling white carrots, water carrots and large carrots on the front row.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The entire crowd of deities all arrived just to watch the flame war.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: @Only Idealism, weren’t you very cocky just now? Come, pretend with laozi. Why didn’t you submit? I’m telling you to say your celestial title, stop playing dead</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: @Only Idealism.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: @Only Idealism.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In an instant, the entire screen was filled with messages from Erlang Shen @ Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Alright.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen was forcing him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had become famous in the celestial realm for a long time, even the Victorious Fighting Buddha, the Monkey King, was only equal to him in a fight. He was truly undefeatable in terms of fighting prowess.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However…</span></p>
 <p><span style>In terms of flaming…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I am a capable young man that has experienced twenty something years of nurture by the country, and watched over several tens of thousands of videos. How could I back down?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I might as well go forcefully instead of submitting.</span></i></p>
