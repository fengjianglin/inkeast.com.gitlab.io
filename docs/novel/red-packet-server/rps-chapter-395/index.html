 <p><span style>Chapter 395 – Ascension?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen truly wanted to curse when he saw the system notification.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What exactly does this guy want? It seems like he’s nurturing me, yet, he is merciless towards me as well.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I stole Diting’s legs, but what should I do now?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A permanent life like a doll was not the kind of life Ye Zichen wanted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you able to hear my words? I just want to ask, who exactly are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stared straight at the phone’s screen but there was no reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Seriously…” Ye Zichen clenched his fist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Liu Qing also walked in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How did you go? Did you complete the mission?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yep.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stretched lazily, then replied, “Diting is safe where he is, right? Ensure that he doesn’t get into any danger. The fact that we stole his legs is already a terrible thing for him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry, he’s definitely safe.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then that’s good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen let out a soft sigh, then stretched lazily, “I’m a bit tired, so I’m going to rest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are we not going to leave immediately?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How could we possibly leave? If we leave now, then the crime of stealing his legs will definitely land on us. We’ll wait here a bit more, then talk about it after seeing the situation tomorrow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nothing else was said that night.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Early next morning, Ye Zichen, who was still dreaming, was suddenly awoken by the commotion outside. He scratched his hair and looked out the window, and saw tons of ghost servants investigating each household one by one.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It seems like Diting has already woken up and found out that his qilin legs were lost.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen licked his lips, then got up from the bed. After a simple wash up, he walked out from their room.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It was fortunate that I passed the little beggar along to Xie Lei to be taken care of.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Otherwise, that little beggar might have seen us stealing the legs. </span></i><span style>Although Ye Zichen wasn’t sure whether the little beggar would expose them or not, it was still a possible trouble.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop right there!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Several ghost servants suddenly stopped him just as Ye Zichen and Liu Qing were about to leave the courtyard house.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lord Diting’s legs were stolen. The entire Underworld has to be searched. You… put up your hands!” The ghost servant answered strongly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately put up his hands to allow himself to be searched without hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay, you can leave now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since the ghost servant did not find any qilin legs on him, the ghost servants didn’t bother him any longer, and directly walk passed him and continued to search every single household.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It seems like the trouble is rather huge. I didn’t think that Diting losing his legs would cause so much trouble.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>At King Ksitigarbha’s Palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva squinted his eyes as he scolded Diting. If it wasn’t for Diting getting drunk, then Diting wouldn’t have lost his qilin legs. Meanwhile, the Ten Yama Kings also stood within the hall and gulped as they did not dare to interrupt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Diting, do you know your wrongs?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Diting knows his wrongs.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Diting floated in midair looking downwards with a troubled expression, while lacking any of his legs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He clearly paid attention to the amount when he was drinking last night, but for some reason, he still ended up getting drunk and falling asleep.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, it would be fine if we can find your qilin legs. If not, then reduce your own cultivation by a thousand years in order to regrow them! This is how you lost your legs back then. Why didn’t you learn from it!” King Ksitigarbha sighed helplessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Ye Zichen and Liu Qing also walked in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened? I heard Diting lost his legs?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kid, did you steal my legs last night?” Diting turned around and looked at Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen instantly put on a confused expression, “… Are you kidding? I fell dead asleep after you left. How can I steal your legs? How did you lose your legs? Did someone saw them off?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, I knew it wouldn’t be you,” Diting suddenly chuckled. “Lemme tell you. My legs will fall off by themselves if I drink too much. I might have gotten too drunk, and so my legs automatically fell off, then got picked up by someone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“… Are you an assembled holy beast? You can actually have pieces fall off!” Ye Zichen put on a speechless expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, King Ksitigarbha finally spoke up, “What did you come here for? Although you are an important guest of our Underworld, there are some places that you cannot casually enter.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This King Ksitigarbha really has a bad temper.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen licked his lips, then indicated towards King Chujiang and the other Yama Kings, “I came to find them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is master coming to find us for?” King Chujiang quickly bowed. Actually, everyone in the hall understood very well that Ye Zichen was the number one suspect of being the leg thief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, they had all carefully searched him after he entered the hall. Yet, they were unable to find the qilin legs on him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They couldn’t probe deeper either because they couldn’t beat the mistress beside him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Neither Diting nor King Ksitigarbha spoke up, so they, mere staff members, naturally did not dare to say anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I still have plenty of stuff to deal with in the Modern World. I’ve pretty much seen all my old friends here in the Underworld, so I was thinking about asking you to open the gate so I could return.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“About this…” King Chujiang subconsciously looked towards Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva. Then, he smiled with a nod after seeing Ksitigarbha’s gaze of confirmation. “No problem!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A huge spatial rift appeared in the hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang also spoke up, “It might be the middle of the day in the Modern Realm right now, so the place I connected the gate to is a rather rural location.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm,” Ye Zichen nodded with a smile. “Come over and play when you have time!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen and Liu Qing disappeared through the rift, King Ksitigarbha also shook his head with a sigh, “Tell them all to return. They won’t be able to find the qilin legs. Diting… Go and grow them out once again!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bodhisattva, you mean…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn’t say that the qilin legs are on that young man. It’s just that there are way too many places in the Underworld. Finding them is like finding a needle in the middle of an ocean without a precise target or location. So that’s that!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ksitigarbha departed from the throne room indifferently, King Chujiang and co. looked at each other, before taking out their phones and sent a message in the group chats. “Come back!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ssssssss.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A huge spatial crack suddenly appeared in a rural grassland, which Ye Zichen and Liu Qing walked out of.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We finally came back, but where is this place?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang definitely would not chuck him too far away. However, even Ye Zichen, someone who grew up in Bingcheng, did not know where they were either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Woosh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the body of Liu Qing, who had only just walked out of the spatial rift, lit up with a rainbow-colored light. That light shot into the sky, while she also rose up as if she had lost her consciousness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Liu Qing,” Ye Zichen raised his hand to grab her, but that light completely repelled him…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Liu Qing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen watch Liu Qing rise to ten-odd meters above the ground, Ye Zichen’s wings popped out of his back, as he followed along beside her while shouting her name.</span></p>
