 <p><span style>Chapter 409 – Everybody Dispatched</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s smiled brightened when he felt his body fill up with power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earth Immortal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now, even when he goes to the Three Realms, he wouldn’t be a small fry of the lowest level. However, when he thought about fighting the Six Realm Patroller and Mo Di…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I’m still a long way from being able to do so!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Seriously, kid, I really don’t know what to say about you,” the Dragon God shook his head with a smile. The speed of Ye Zichen’s breakthrough was so fast that even he felt a bit jealous, not to mention Ye Zichen was doing it in a place without plenty of spiritual energy like the abandoned place. “Alright, since you finished cultivating, then stop disturbing this old man’s rest here. Go back!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon God waved his sleeve towards Ye Zichen and Xia Keke…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoosh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The scenery in front of their eyes changed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They opened their eyes, and looked at each other directly, then at the bed that they were on…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke instantly blushed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you looking at, if you stare anymore, then I’ll dig your eyes out of your sockets.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zezeze, look at how fierce you are. It can’t be the hour of you shamelessly telling me to get a room together with you, right?” Ye Zichen twitched his mouth at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Xia Keke’s face instantly turned as red as an apple. She bit her lips softly and wrinkled her nose. “If you say that again, then I’ll really get angry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Buzz.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The phone on the table rang. Xia Keke picked up the phone and saw the caller ID and started to smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s a call from Susu.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She put her phone beside her ear. Then, not long later, she hung up and turned towards Ye Zichen. “Susu is telling me to go eat with her. Do you want to come?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen touched his stomach. He had spent the entire day cultivating over at the old Dragon God’s place. If Xia Keke didn’t mention it, then he might not have noticed his hunger, but after mentioning it, Ye Zichen did feel rather hungry. “C’mon, I’ll go and be your wallet!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s more like it,” Xia Keke curled her lips, then jumped off the bed and put on her slippers with knitted eyebrows. “Hurry up, Susu’s already there. If we make her wait too long, then she would get anxious.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, under Xia Keke’s hurry, the two of them arrived at the restaurant Su Yan mentioned in half an hour.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan supported her held with her hands as she looked silently out of the window in a window-side seat. The sunlight shining onto her face made her even more alluring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but take out his phone and take a few photos.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Su Yan also looked up with a smile, “You guys came together.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm, this guy said that he’s going to be our wallet. Hehe… We can save some money,” Xia Keke sat beside Su Yan with a giggle, then waved towards a waiter. “We want to order.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they sat down, Ye Zichen immediately set the photo he just took as his screensaver.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan raised her eyebrows, “What are you doing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Take a look!” Ye Zichen handed his phone over with a chuckle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke also took a peak. When she saw the screen saver, she couldn’t help but retort, “You won’t be able to be a cameraman in your life. Susu’s so pretty, and your photo… Zeze, I really don’t want to say too much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugly? I feel like she’s really pretty!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan couldn’t help but blush when she felt the sincerity behind Ye Zichen’s praise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your affability level with Su Yan increased by 5. Current affability level: 505.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was completely stunned upon receiving the system notification. </span><i><span style>My affability level seems not to have changed in so long, and the atmosphere between us has been rather strange.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>When the affability level rose again, Ye Zichen felt like…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The feelings from before were back once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As they ate, the table was surrounded by a sweet aura, which Ye Zichen enjoyed a lot as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After eating his fill, Ye Zichen stretched lazily, then glanced outside the window. All of a sudden, he noticed that Wei Chen’s car seemed to have passed by from the outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vroom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After that, four black MPVs also followed them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everybody was dispatched?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Recently, the situation of the abyssals did not turn for the better. Instead, it only became worse. However, what was fortunate was that there was never too many abyssals, so they only had to dispatch one team to deal with them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, looking at the number of cars, it seemed like everybody in the organization was dispatched.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A bad feeling arose in Ye Zichen’s heart. He immediately called Wei Chen without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Ye.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on? I seem to have seen quite a few cars just now. Is the situation this time very troublesome?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Previously, Wei Chen’s reply would always be some comforting words, but this time…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s very troublesome,” Wei Chen’s tone was sullen. “Previously, the abyssals would generally be mostly consisting of those that originated from small animals. Those abyssal are still the main force, but I noticed that there are three more people this time… What’s more, the person controlling them also seems to be there. That’s why I’m bringing a bit more people just in case.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What!?” Ye Zichen slammed the table and stood up, completely scaring Su Yan and Xia Keke. “Tell me the exact location. I’m going as well!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Ye, although it is rather troublesome here, but believe me, we can definitely handle it,” Wei Chen replied softly. He knew about Ye Zichen’s real identity, and didn’t want him to go over to such a dangerous place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you the boss, or am I the boss? I told you to tell me the position, so do it. In terms of strength, you really might not be stronger than me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Wei Chen instantly gave in with a sigh, “Fine, since you want to come, then come. We haven’t entered yet. We’ll wait for you before entering!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen hung up the call, both Su Yan and Xia Keke looked at him worriedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Something happened again?” Su Yan asked softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded, then rubbed their heads, “Just keep on doing what you’re doing. There’s no need to worry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m going to go with you,” Xia Keke pouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately scolded. “No way. Why do you want to follow me to where I’m going!? Don’t be so willful… Be a good girl.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen placed a card on the table, then left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two girls knitted their eyebrows as they watched him leave. At that moment, Xia Keke pulled Su Yan closer and whispered something into her ear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan immediately revealed a hesitating gaze, but she still eventually nodded in agreement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The place Wei Chen talked about was a restaurant on the western side of the city. Ye Zichen was very familiar with the restaurant as it was where him and his roommates often ate together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wei Chen held a cigarette in his mouth and squatted on the floor like a mobster outside the restaurant, while several tens of subordinates in black leather jackets stood behind him…</span></p>
 <p><span style>It really was fortunate that no police came over to arrest them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Ye,” the members of the organization greeted Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded and looked around…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nobody else was walking by in the area already. It seemed like Wei Chen had already dealt with everything else before he had arrived. Ye Zichen licked his lips, and walked over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Wei Chen also threw the cigarette onto the floor and stamped it out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Ye,” he nodded towards Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen also responded with a nod, “You’re all ready? Let’s go in!”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Original Chapter Teaser:</b>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p><b>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</b>Wei Chen, you look troubled. Are you going out?</p>
 <p><strong>Wei Chen:&nbsp;</strong>Yeah, an issue has come up.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Is it going to be a huge issue?</p>
 <p><strong>Wei Chen:&nbsp;</strong>I'm not so sure, but I do think so. The scale of the abyssal army is so much larger this time, and there are actually three humanoid abyssals.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Then I'm coming.</p>
 <p><strong>Wei Chen:&nbsp;</strong>Boss Ye, your task is...</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>I know what my task is, and honestly, I'm still not quite sure. So I might as well come with you. Seeing this abnormal situation first hand might give me some clues as to who is behind all this.</p>
