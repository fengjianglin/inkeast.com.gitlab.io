 <p><span style>Chapter 144 – Got face-slapped, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment the restaurant manager heard this, he instantly felt extremely troubled.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This can’t be settled peacefully now.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Qu Yaoyang licked his lips with an invasive gaze as he checked Huang Shengmei out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing Qu Yaoyang’s words, Huang Yi instantly became very angry, and stepped forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Watch your mouth when you speak to my older sister.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yo, brother-in-law,” Qu Yaoyang smiled playfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Huang Yi clenched his fist and was about to wave it, but was stopped by Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stepped forward with a smile, then glanced at Qu Yaoyang, “I changed my mind.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm?” Qu Yaoyang straightened his neck and snickered. “Do you want to give that woman…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen slapped Qu Yaoyang, then rubbed his hand, “Originally, I wanted to finish eating quickly and give the room to you, but, you pissed me off. I’m very unhappy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandson, f*ck…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen directly kicked Qu Yaoyang, then pointed to the manager, who was on the side, “Hold him down there. If you don’t hold him down, then you don’t need to be a manager anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Ye, aren’t you just troubling me!” The manager was truly on the verge of tears, he couldn’t afford to offend Ye Zichen, but he couldn’t afford to offend Qu Yaoyang either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then you want to trouble me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The manager called over a nearby waiter after a brief hesitation, “Hold Young Master Qu down.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>One person dominates another.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mr. Ye, who was in front of him, was pressuring him, so he could only pressure the waiter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter what, he wasn’t going to take responsibility for it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to see which one of you dares to touch me. If any of you dares to do anything to me, then I’ll make it so that you cannot live in Bingcheng anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span style> All of these waiters and waitresses had heard about Qu Yaoyang’s ability. He definitely wasn’t just scaring them, he could definitely do it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, the waiters stopped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sighed, it seemed like making the waiters do it was troubling them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed like he had to do everything himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen strode over to Qu Yaoyang, and glared at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, he stepped on him with one foot, and pressed him down onto the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little brat, I won’t let you off,” Qu Yaoyang cursed on the floor, while he struggled to stand up, only to feel that a ton of weight was on him, causing him to be unable to move.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen twitched his mouth and dialed Xiao Hai’s number.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Xiao Hai sat on the sofa in his office, while his secretary handed him the recent plans. He looked over to receive it, then smiled, “Zichen, why did you think of suddenly calling Hai-ge?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hai-ge, this does count as me only going to you when I have some business,” Ye Zichen squinted his eyes, and swept his gaze across everyone in the room. “I’m eating in one of your restaurants. There is a grandson called Qu Yaoyang who pissed me off. I’m rather unhappy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who is Qu Yaoyang?” Xiao Hai was stunned. Due to his level, he didn’t know a small dandy like Qu Yaoyang at all. “However, since he offended you, then that grandson is unfortunate. Hai-ge can’t go in person, but Huang Ming often plays with those little dandies, so I’ll tell him to go over.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I’ll be troubling you, Hai-ge.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The manager on the side continuously wiped sweat off his forehead the moment Ye Zichen made the call. He knew that this Mr. Ye had called their big boss.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qu Yaoyang, who was being stepped on by Ye Zichen, no longer struggled as much. Instead, he asked worriedly, “Who did you call just now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have a guess?” Ye Zichen laughed softly and signaled the manager to bring a chair over to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, he just sat down on the chair, while putting his left foot on Qu Yaoyang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Approximately half an hour later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The door to the room was forcefully pushed open. Then, Huang Ming hurried in. When Qu Yaoyang, who was lying on the floor saw him, the former quickly shouted, “Young Master Huang, you’re finally here…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>From his tone, it was as if Qu Yaoyang was also waiting for Huang Ming’s arrival.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck you!” Huang Ming lifted his leg and kicked Qu Yaoyang’s face, instantly causing a section of his face to bruise, while teeth flowed out with blood from his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Ming furiously spat on Qu Yaoyang, then raised his hands and arched his back, “Ye-dage.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded, then raised his foot from Qu Yaoyang’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, he stretched lazily with a frown, “It really isn’t easy to eat a meal at your place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-dage, how do you want to handle this grandson?” Huang Ming kicked Qu Yaoyang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen licked his lips and shrugged, “Your choice, just deal with him however you want. I got Hai-ge to tell you to come over because I want to eat a meal peacefully, understood?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did Huang Ming notice Huang Shengmei, who was on the side. He nodded slightly towards her, then grabbed Qu Yaoyang by the collar and cursed, “You dare to disturb Ye-dage’s meal. I think you’re sick of living.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Ming nodded towards Ye Zichen, and was just about to hurry from the room when he heard Ye Zichen speak up once more, “Oh yeah, the brat you’re carrying swore so many times, and even spoke unreservedly towards the lady beside me…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-dage, I will handle it properly,” said Huang Ming, before respectfully closing the door to the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, Ye Zichen turned around and smiled towards Huang Shengmei and Huang Yi, “Now we can eat properly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, due to the incident just now, the meal went by rather awkwardly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they quickly finished eating, Ye Zichen said apologetically, “Next time, Zichen-ge will treat you guys to another meal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, but don’t treat us. If we’re going to eat next time, let’s just eat at home,” since the incident that happened just now was still fresh in her mind, Huang Shengmei did not want such a situation to occur the next time they ate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s good too.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen thought of the earlier situation, he didn’t really have anything much to say. He really was unfortunate to bump into this sort of thing when he just wanted to have a meal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sighed softly, then looked towards Huang Yi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How is it, how about Zichen-ge take you to see that team?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So fast?” Huang Yi frowned and scratched his face. “Zichen-ge, my leg was just healed, I don’t want to join the team so early, since that would mean I have to sit down all day again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, then just contact me when you want to go,” Ye Zichen patted Huang Yi’s shoulders a few times, then left the room with them with raised eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment they walked out of the door, they saw Huang Ming standing at the entrance of the room with a cigarette in his mouth. The moment Huang Ming saw Ye Zichen come out, he immediately walked up and wanted to say something…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go back first, I’ll chat with him a bit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Huang Shengmei and Huang Yi left, Ye Zichen looked towards Huang Ming, “Say it, what do you want to tell me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-dage, I already dealt with that grandson, Qu Yaoyang.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm, and…” Ye Zichen nodded. He could clearly that that Huang Ming did not only want to tell him that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I really couldn’t hide it from Ye-dage,” Huang Ming scratched his head and laughed idiotically. It was very hard to imagine that this brat was someone that was beyond vicious when he saw Ye Zichen only a month ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright now, if you have anything, just directly say it,” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Ming hesitated for a moment, then clenched his teeth, “I want to buy a Great Recovery Pill from Ye-dage, or even that peach!”</span></p>
