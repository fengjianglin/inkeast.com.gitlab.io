 <p><span style>Chapter 635 – Liu Qing’s Change</span></p>
 <p><span style>No one would suspect a thing even if the girl on the rainbow bridge had proclaimed herself as a fairy from the nine heavens. She walked down the rainbow bridge elegantly, and this caused everyone in the entire city to watch her in a mesmerized manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You Highness,” Youmuu quickly raced over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The girl nodded with a smile, “Do you know your wrongs?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your subordinate knows his wrongs,” Youmuu did not dare to retort, and merely bowed his head deeply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Ye Zichen was already dumbfounded. </span><i><span style>This girl…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Liu Qing.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing seemed a bit more mature compared now to when she was taken away to the God Realm. There was an indescribable coldness that could be felt through her actions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“His Majesty told you to recruit capable people, he didn’t tell you to come here and get cocky,” Liu Qing said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youmuu repeatedly nodded, “Your Highness is right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But don’t worry, I will help put in a word for you with His Majesty,” with that, Liu Qing walked over in front of the white-robed man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She checked him out curiously with her crystal clear eyes. Then after a while, Liu Qing smiled, “Senior, why do you cover your face? Do you not want junior to recognize you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s not the case,” the white-robed man smiled. “But since you’re here, then nothing else is going to come up. I’ll leave this place to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior, do you not want to see me?” Liu Qing’s eyes sparkled with unshed tears.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The white-robed man, who was about to leave, paused in his tracks with a chuckle. “The one down there probably wants to see you even more than me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, the white-robed man disappeared. Only then did Liu Qing smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youmuu followed behind her, while Mu Cheng gulped and tidied himself up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, he also reminded Mu Chengtian to put on his best act.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other people also did similar things.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They did not dare to act carelessly around someone even the Six Realms Patroller has to treat carefully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Highness, the one I chose this time is him,” Youmuu pointed towards Mu Chengtian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn’t expect you see you here,” Liu Qing ignored Youmuu and walked directly towards Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In all honesty, Ye Zichen had a lot of things he wanted to say to Liu Qing. However, the cold tone and the distance in her actions caused him to swallow his words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A Sky Immortal now. Not bad, not bad at all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you really Liu Qing?” Ye Zichen couldn’t help but ask. He didn’t believe that Liu Qing would talk to him like that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, I have to thank you for forging a celestial body for me, it has allowed me to act like fish in the water even in the God Realm,” Liu Qing smiled. “I am indebted to you for that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, a golden fruit appeared in her hands. “This is a Sacred Fruit that took a million years to mature. I’ll gift it to you to repay your favor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Highness,” Youmuu frowned. “His Majesty left it to you so that you can use it when you breakthrough to the Sky Supreme level.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do I even need it?” Liu Qing’s eyes were cold. “Is the Sky Supreme level enough to stop me with my talents?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No,” Youmuu shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did Liu Qing smiled as she handed the fruit towards Ye Zichen. “Take it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s gaze never left Liu Qing’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He could not understand just why did Liu Qing turned out like that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you looking at me like that? Are you still thinking about what I said back then? I’ll admit it, I really liked you a lot before going to the God Realm. That’s all because I was too inexperienced. When I arrived in the God Realm, I noticed that there are plenty of people better than you. You might not know this, but if I wanted to get married, millions of young men in the God Realm would come and fight over me. They are far stronger than you in both strength and status,” Liu Qing pursed her lips with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was at a loss for words. Then, after a long while, he sighed, “It’s good that you’re doing well. Keep the sacred fruit. Reviving you was merely a promise of mine. It’s not a favor or anything.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hah, oh well,” Liu Qing put the fruit away with a soft smile, then looked towards Mu Chengtian. “Twin souls… He’s indeed got potential. But his main body is too weak, he won’t ever become anything great. Youmuu, you were off the mark this time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Highness…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Leave him. In terms of talent, even Ye Zichen is several times better than him. Just treat it like we didn’t find anyone talented this time. Let’s return.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood.” The rainbow bridge landed from the sky once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing stepped onto the bridge with Youmuu in tow, “Ye Zichen, no matter what, I still owe you this life.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the two people who stepped into the bridge disappeared, Ye Zichen smiled softly, then saw Zuo Mo twitch her mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just how many women do you have around you? That being said, your choice in women are rather varied. You even hooked up with Her Highness from the God Realm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, stop making fun of me,” Ye Zichen shook his head with a smile, then glanced over at Mu Chengtian and Mu Cheng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Mu Cheng heard Liu Qing say that they weren’t going to take Mu Chengtian, Mu Cheng’s expression became gradually more terrible. Zuo Hongxin was the same. He had thought that he managed to cut ahead of Zuo Hongde, but the truth was that he cut ahead in something that was a dead end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Zuo Hongde found the situation rather hilarious. He looked at Zuo Hongxin and Mu Cheng meaningfully, “It seems like all your plans attributed to nothing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Zuo,” Mu Cheng walked over with a forced smile. “I said the wrong thing earlier. So, about the wedding between our houses…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn’t you say that you wanted to become in-laws with my little brother? That’s a pretty good idea…” Zuo Hongde smiled towards Zuo Mo and Ye Zichen. “Let’s go. We should leave some time for them to talk about the details of the engagement.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen and co. departed, Zuo Hongxin squinted his eyes with a frown, “Zuo Hongde is sure cocky.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah,” Mu Cheng snorted. “He truly thinks too highly of himself. I heard that the Treasure Tower’s youngsters are going to compete for the Tower Head soon?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Indeed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, Zuo Hongde and Zuo Mo won’t be able to do anything when our families become in-laws. The Tower Head position will definitely belong to Qingcheng.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I’ll take Brother Mu’s word for it,” Zuo Hongxin forced a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Cheng nodded and patted Zuo Hongxin’s shoulders. “C’mon, let’s figure out just how are we going to screw Zuo Hongde over.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing walked in front of the rainbow bridge, while Youmuu followed behind for a long time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Highness.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?” Liu Qing didn’t even turn around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youmuu pursed his lips, “You should still have some… for that kid just now…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No point of asking that anymore,” Liu Qing stopped and glanced at the clouds below the bridge. “His Majesty has high hopes for me. I will not disappoint His Majesty’s nurturing. What’s more, him and I are no longer people from the same world. We hold different statuses now and have seen different things. I’ve already forgotten about him.”</span></p>
