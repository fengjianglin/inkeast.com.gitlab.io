 <p><span style>As the temperature of the room plummeted, Ye Zichen, who sat on the sofa, looked up. He couldn’t help but shudder when he saw Lu Lu’s frosty face. </span><i><span style>This was exactly what she started with when she froze that snakeman.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A look of shock flashed across Fatty Yin’s face. Then he raised his eyebrows in confusion, “The room seems to have gotten colder.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you want to continue pretending in front of me?” Lu Lu squinted her eyes, while the torrent of ice and snow in her hands increased in size. “Answer me, why are you trying to get close to Ye Zichen?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Girl, you really are strange. I got along extremely well with him on the plane, and he helped me deal with a bit of trouble. How can you say that I’m deliberately trying to get close to him?” Fatty Yin puffed up his chest with a frown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Lu smiled plainly, “If you aren’t saying it, then die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Lu smacked the torrent in her hands towards the fatty without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen tensed up and quickly grabbed her arm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you doing?” Lu Lu frowned. “Why aren’t you letting me kill him!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lu Lu, this is a peaceful society. Don’t always kill this and that. This fatty’s just a normal person. It’s illegal for you to kill him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, Ye Zichen had already suspected the fatty to be someone that other races had sent over to kill him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was able to use his Fiery Eyes of Truth to determine that the fatty was a normal person. After that, he immediately stopped worrying and just thought that the fatty was someone who got familiar with people easily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t forget your identity!” Lu Lu frowned, then snorted as she pointed to Fatty Yin. “This guy has two spiritual bodies in his body.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?” Ye Zichen was shocked. He looked at Fatty’s Yin stiff face and gulped. “Two souls?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Others can’t tell, but I can,” Lu Lu protected Ye Zichen behind her, and stared straight at the fatty. “Tell me your intentions. Otherwise, die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty Yin smiled coyly and revealed a confused expression in face of Lu Lu’s powerful demeanor, “What are you saying? Why don’t I understand?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I said it already, don’t pretend in front of me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, Lu Lu’s hand emitted a blue glow. She patted her hand against the fatty’s head with force, causing a spiritual body to be pulled out from the fatty’s sea of consciousness.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As expected of the Three Realm’s Ice Empress,” the spiritual body smiled faintly, then went back into the fatty’s body, before hugging his shoulders with his hands. “Actually, our goal is the same. I also have to protect him. There is no need for you to be so hostile towards me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye ZIchen was already completely shocked. No matter what, he did not expect that the fatty actually had two souls.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>And the other soul knows the Ice Empress of the Three Realms!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Just because you said you’ll protect him? Don’t you think what you said was funny?” Lu Lu curled her lips. “You… cannot be left alive!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She left forward and smacked her palm towards the fatty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fatty dodged Lu Lu’s attack with a feint, “It is still too hard for a mere Body Double to deal with me. Girl, I know you’re doing it for Ye Zichen’s good, but don’t generalize. There are… plenty of people that want to protect him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fatty smiled faintly, then squinted his eyes, I swear by my heart demon that I am only getting close to Ye Zichen in order to protect him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing the fatty’s words, Lu Lu took a step back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the fatty saw that, he chuckled, “Do you believe it now? Can you retract this freezing temperature? It’s too cold.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Humph, then I’ll force myself to believe you this once,” Lu Lu retracted the ice and snow using her hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fatty put on a look of helplessness, “C’mon, if my oath by my heart demon was a lie, then I’m screwed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph,” Lu Lu snorted coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Girl, you really have a bad temper… Fine, since you are by Ye Zichen’s side now, then I don’t need to watch over him currently. Since I also need to help this little fatty deal with his relationship problems, then I’ll be off.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, the fatty disappeared from the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a while, laughter suddenly sounded out all around the room, “Oh yeah, I’ll come over again when I have time. Gu family… Let’s meet there. Hahahaha!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The echoed laughter resonated in the room for a long time, while Ye Zichen squinted his eyes, then turned to look at Lu Lu…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that fatty a good guy or a bad guy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not certain, but it’s more likely that he’s a good guy, “Lu Lu licked her lips. “He did swear by his heart demon. As long as he’s not trying to screw himself over, then what he said is most likely true.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s swearing by his heart demon?” Ye Zichen asked in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s hard to explain it to you right now. You’re still too weak. When you reach the level of an Earth Immortal, you will come into contact with it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was truly a bit shocked. If it wasn’t for Lu Lu, he might never find out that the fatty actually had two spiritual bodies within him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It seems like the level 1 of the Fiery Eyes of Truth isn’t quite enough. When I find the time, I have to quickly get some cultivation experience to buy all of the remaining levels.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh yeah, the fatty said that you are a Body Double just now?” Ye Zichen glanced at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm,” Lu Lu nodded. “My main body needs to assume command in the Elk Race in the Three Realms. The situation there is too chaotic right now, I have to make sure that my tribesmen are safe.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is the situation over there extremely bad?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It cannot be described as extremely bad,” Lu Lu twitched her mouth and snorted. The time of the Struggle for the Three Realms is nigh. The situation in the Three Realms will be changed, so the relationships between the realms are very tense.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see!” Ye Zichen just replied randomly. Even if she told him about the situation there, he wouldn’t understand.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Struggle for the Three Realms…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It seems like my phone had this new function activated as well.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Am I supposed to get involved as well?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen scratched his head. At that moment, the door to the room was knocked on again, and Ye Zichen’s phone also rang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Ye, I’m here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows, then quickly walked to the room door and opened it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Tian’s stood at the entrance with his symbolic smoke-colored hair and a faint smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Ye.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brat, you finally came,” Ye Zichen patted his shoulders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Lu Lu also walked over, “And who is he?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Ye’s life is truly great. You have a beauty accompanying you even in the capital,” with that, Gu Tian cupped his hands in front of his chest towards Lu Lu. “Gu Tian.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t bullshit so much,” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes at Gu Tian in annoyance. “Now… Let’s go to the Gu household!”</span></p>

 <p><b>Fatty Yin:&nbsp;</b>Hmmm? Girl, I'm not sure that I understand what you're saying.</p>
 <p><strong>Lu Lu:&nbsp;</strong>Answer me. Why!?</p>
 <p><strong>Fatty Yin:&nbsp;</strong>Huh? Girl...</p>
 <p><strong>Lu Lu:&nbsp;</strong>I said, ANSWER ME!</p>
 <p><strong>Fatty Yin:&nbsp;</strong>(runs over to Ye Zichen's side) Bro, this girl's got some issue, I don't get what she's saying at all...</p>
 <p><em>Ye Zichen frowns.</em></p>
 <p><strong>Lu Lu:&nbsp;</strong>Fatty, move away from Ye Zichen, and now, tell me exactly why you possessed someone else to get close to him. Don't try and pretend that you don't know what I'm talking about. I can clearly tell that there are two spiritual bodies in there!</p>
 <p><strong>Fatty Yin:&nbsp;</strong>Hehe... I really am not sure...</p>
