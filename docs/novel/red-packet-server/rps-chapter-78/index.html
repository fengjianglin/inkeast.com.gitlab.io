 <p><span style>If it was before, Ye Zichen definitely wouldn’t dare to speak up publicly in the group, but things were different now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He already had a celestial title, celestial plate and even a manor, what was he afraid of?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s appearance instantly caused the group to explode. The name “Only Idealism” could be said to be a legend in the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing had @’d him personally, and Erlang Shen had a flame war with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: Great deity appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: Idol &lt;insert a bunch of emojis with heart-shaped eyes&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Doesn’t great deity like to lurk?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mother of Lightning: Wow, what’s going on? Even great deity popped up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone in the group instantly turned their attention towards Ye Zichen. As Ye Zichen looked at the chat log that kept on scrolling down, he really felt a bit speechless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Cough, cough, pay attention to the main point. This sovereign has come to ask for red packets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Yeah, dragon kings, send red packets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mother of Lightning: Send red packets, red packets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Barefoot Immortal: I also want to get in on this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dragon King of the East Sea: This great deity is…</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the first time the Dragon King of the East Sea had seen Ye Zichen after being in the Heavenly Court for so long.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No one in the group replied. To be honest, they didn’t know what Ye Zichen’s true identity was either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen directly sent out his celestial title, celestial plate and residence without thinking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The celestial title and plate didn’t really matter. What was important was the location of the residence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>137 Willow Stone Alley, Thirty-Seventh Heaven.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The group instantly exploded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For them who lived in the Heavenly Court, most of them resided below the Eighteen Heaven. Anyone staying between the Eighteenth and Thirty-Sixth Heaven was already a great deity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thirty-Seventh Deity, that meant that he stayed on the same floor with Taibai Jinxing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: Greetings to the celestial sovereign.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Greetings to the celestial sovereign.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mother of Lightning: Greetings to the celestial sovereign.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon King of the Far East was shocked, he didn’t think that he had such much honor to be @’d by such a high-level deity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn’t help but secretly screenshot it. This was something he could definitely brag about to other back home.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Cough, cough, stop. This sovereign just came to ask for red packets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: @Dragon King of the East Sea, @Dragon King of the West Sea, @Dragon King of the North Sea, @Dragon King of the South Sea, the great deity told you guys to send red packets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dragon King of the East Sea: Going to send it now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Originally, he didn’t want to send it, but there was no helping it. A great deity had @ him, he couldn’t be petty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He clenched his teeth and stomped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Send.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s phone shook.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was too slow, and the red packets had all been snatched.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck, are these deities all animals.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at the number of red packets sent. There were 50, and yet they were all gone in an instant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dragon King of the East Sea: I’ve sent it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dragon King of the West Sea: My turn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Ye Zichen saw the Dragon King of the West Sea’s message, he stared intently at the screen. He got distracted just now, he must get it this time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Snatch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received the Dragon King of the West Sea’s red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fragment of Soul Pearl Yiyuan x1</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before most people were able to react, the Dragon King of the South Sea also sent a red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clicked down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Double kill!</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received the Dragon King of the South Sea’s red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fragment of Soul Pearl Yiyuan x1</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon King of the North Sea’s red packet also appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Triple kill!</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received the Dragon King of the North Sea’s red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fragment of Soul Pearl Yiyuan x1</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was a bit shocked after snatching all the red packets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All three packets were a Fragment of Soul Pearl Yiyuan.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What was the use of this Soul Pearl Yiyuan?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: Great deity is so lucky @Only Idealism.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: My god, great deity got three fragments.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: Why did I get a Blood Coral. This isn’t fair!</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the looks of the group, this Fragment of Soul Pearl Yiyuan was something good.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen opened his WeChat Treasure Chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were three fragments of Soul Pearl Yiyuan in the chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fragment of Soul Pearl Yiyuan: A personal ancient magical item used by the Yellow Emperor during his battle with Chiyou. There are six fragments in total.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Current fragment number: 3.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ancient magical item, but f*ck. Even if it was a fragment of an ancient magical item, it was completely useless for him.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, everyone in the group said Ye Zichen was lucky, and that it was as expected of a celestial sovereign, and that he had luck equaling the heavens.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the stingy God of Thunder suddenly sent a message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: It seems like great deity Nameless didn’t send a red packet when he entered the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mother of Lightning: That seems to be the case.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: @Only Idealism, great deity, you shouldn’t break the rules.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, the Dragon Kings of the Four Seas immediately spoke up as well. They had just given so much up just now, they needed to get something back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but become speechless as they looked at the scrolling chat log.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were starting to screw with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, Ye Zichen’s eyes brightened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This seemed to be a good thing for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had wanted to advertise his convenience store in the Heavenly Court, isn’t this giving him a chance!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: One moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shouted towards Liu Jing after sending that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Liu Jing, go and steal a few boxes of soft drinks for me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah what? Go and steal a few boxes, it’s not convenient for me to do so right now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kay.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, Liu Jing appeared in front of him carrying a bunch of drinks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Scan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Send.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingodng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rows of messages stating that someone receiving your red packet instantly appeared on Ye Zichen’s screen. The speed nearly caused his phone to freeze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: Sprite, what’s this?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: @Only Idealism, great deity what is Shuangwaiwai?</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: What is Pepsi Coke?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: These are items that this sovereign has found in this secret realm. They are treasures, enjoy them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment he said that, Erlang Shen, the Monkey King, Yue Lao and Old Lord Taishang popped up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: @Only Idealism, bro, why didn’t you tell me that you’re sending red packets?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: @Only Idealism, why didn’t you @ Old Sun?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: I seem to have missed it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang: I came a step too late, it’s all gone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the people in the group saw that the four people who appeared actually all knew Ye Zichen, the group exploded once again. After all, these four people were great deities in the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, Ye Zichen’s position in their hearts increased once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s WeChat rang a few times. Ye Zichen took a look and saw Taibai Jinxing had sent him messages.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing: Who allowed you to send these trash into the group?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing: Who gave you the right to do so. I saw that Yue Lao and Old Lord Taishang got cigarettes a while ago, you sent it, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Oh wow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This geezer Taibai actually knew these stuffs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen thought more into it, he realized that it really wasn’t anything since Taibai Jinxing already knew his identity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen didn’t care. He directly replied without retorting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing: You’re ah’ing with me? Did you know…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before Taibai Jinxing finished, Ye Zichen directly sent a red packet over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Don’t say this kid is immature, this is soft packaging Zhonghua, it costs 650 cultivation experience. I’ll just give it to you.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen ignored him after sending him that, there was no need to bullshit so much.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right now, Taibai Jinxing was showing off his authority in front of Ye Zichen. Just give him (Ye Zichen) a bit of time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t certain who would be in charge of the Heavenly Court in the future!</span></p>
