 <p><span style>Chapter 158 – The World is so Small</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Lin Ru watched the group of people leave, she looked towards Lin Lin with a frown, “Lin Lin, how did you offend my friends?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your friends?” Lin Lin smiled mockingly. “Lil’ Ru, I think you became an idiot from living a normal person’s life, right? Just what kind of things do you get to know?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Idiot! Just wait till you regret it,” Lin Ru rolled her eyes, then walked towards the manor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, don’t get mad at Lin Lin. He grew up with everything handed to him on a silver platter, that’s why his personality is like that,” Wu Haoyu comforted softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen picked up the cold drink on the table, then shook his head with a laugh, “Aren’t you the same? Why don’t I see you like that? His personality is like that. There’s no need for you to explain that much for him, I’m in no mood to care about someone like him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, I’m different from him,” Wu Haoyu shook his head with a smile. “I’ll stop talking about him. I wanted to get you to help Old Man Lin do a check-up…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He doesn’t need my help… Didn’t he say that? Someone will do it, so stop worrying,” Ye Zichen patted Wu Haoyu on his shoulders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, his phone rang.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Deng Cheng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>What did that gramps call him for?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gramps!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Deng Cheng’s expression stiffened when he heard the way he was addressed through the phone, then he shook his head with a wry smile, “Lil’ Ye, do you have time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That would depend on what you want from me. Then I’ll decide if I have time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you always so wary towards me?” Deng Cheng smiled wryly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes, “There’s no helping it. Gramps, I always feel like you’re too crafty, if I am not careful, I would have to count the money for you after you sell me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll be very sad if you’re like this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Feel sad if you want.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was truly speechless towards Deng Cheng. He was already a gramps with a head full of white hair, yet he actually started to act soft and weak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What exactly do you want? Say it quickly, I’m very busy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay. Didn’t I ask you to help take a look at one of my old friends? He just come back from the capital, let’s go over to take a look?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, then come pick me up, I’m at…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen told Deng Cheng the address, then hung up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There’s no helping it, he did promise Deng Cheng this. He would be untrustworthy if he went back on his word.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, since you’re still busy, then I’ll be going. Lin Ru just WeChatted me to come and find her…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go, go, go. Say hi to Lin Ru for me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Wu Haoyu left the cold drinks store, Ye Zichen stood under the umbrella outside the cold drinks store and looked up towards the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>About twenty minutes later, a black BMW stopped in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Ye,” Deng Cheng walked over with a kind smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen took a look at his car.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hehe.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>760.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Gramps, your car’s pretty good. You didn’t be a doctor for so long for nothing. Do you have a granddaughter or something, how about letting me be a live-in grandson-in-law? Then I would have to work less hard for the last half of my life.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen merely wanted to tease the gramps. He never expected Deng Cheng to be happy instead of angry after hearing that, “I really do have a granddaughter. How about I introduce the two of you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen glanced at Deng Cheng’s happy face speechlessly.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The plot didn’t seem to be right!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Since he instantly lost, Ye Zichen didn’t reply, and merely opened the car door and sat inside with the Great Sage and Third Fatty Jin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This little fellow…” Deng Cheng pursed his lips and smiled. He’s someone that’s lived for a long time, how could he not tell that Ye Zichen was just teasing him?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>But his reply just now was sincere!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s medical skills were something that he could recognize. Even he admits that he was slightly worse than Ye Zichen in terms of medical skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His family was a medical one, and his granddaughter did study medicine…</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he really could introduce them, it might be a good relationship.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Deng Cheng shook his head, while such a seed was planted in his heart. He begun to think that if he had the chance, he must let Ye Zichen and his granddaughter get to know each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big bro, this road is so familiar!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Fatty Jin slightly frowned as he looked outside, while Liu Qing also nodded in agreement as she floated at the top of the car, “Yeah, we seemed to be here just earlier.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did Ye Zichen look outside. The moment he did that, his face instantly turned dark.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gramps.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck, they really came here before.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>If there was no surprise, Gramps Deng Cheng should be driving them to the Lin family home.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it?” Deng Cheng did not stop the car.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen let out a long sigh and said speechlessly, “Is the surname of the patient you want me to treat Lin?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"How did you know?” Deng Cheng was stunned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing this reply, Ye Zichen laughed speechlessly.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It was truly a small world.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pursed his lips with a strange smile, then put his hand behind his head and stopped talking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were no surprises. Deng Cheng did drive to the Lin famly home.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The car only stopped after entering the Lin family manor without stopping. The moment they parked, a bunch of people waited outside the car door to greet them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Hanben opened the car door for Elder Deng in person. It really wasn’t easy for someone of his identity and position to do that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Elder Deng!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His face carried a warm smile. His wife, Zhao Shuangying, stood behind him…</span></p>
 <p><span style>As well as Lin Lin, who was beyond cocky earlier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandpa Deng.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Lin greeted Elder Deng respectfully, to which Deng Cheng nodded with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Deng Cheng looked subconsciously towards the car and wondered why Ye Zichen did not get out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, Lin Hanben made a please gesture at the same time, “Elder Deng, please.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please what? The real person hasn’t come out yet. Aren’t you in too much of a hurry?” Elder Deng chuckled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did Lin Hanben notice that someone was in the backseat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Elder Deng…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The person checking on Old Lin this time isn’t me, it’s a master that I invited. Old Lin’s sickness can definitely be treated with him here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Hanben revealed a surprised expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Deng was extremely reputed in the medical realm, he was called the Six Great National Masters alongside the five in the capital.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Someone that he called a master would definitely be an extremely amazing person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cold sweat immediately flowed down Lin Hanben’s forehead when he thought back to his pride earlier. Their family’s old man was the pillar of the Lin family, if his gesture just now caused that master to be even slightly unhappy…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Hanben nodded towards Elder Deng with a smile, then respectfully ran to the backdoor of the car and stood up straight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Fatty Jin rubbed his hands. He loved these sorts of scenarios for him to show-off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wanted to see Lin Lin’s appearance of getting humiliated for a long time. If it wasn’t for Ye Zichen stopping him, he would have gotten out of the car ages ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, can we get out of the car yet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Get out,” Ye Zichen nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Fatty Jin instantly lifted his head, and walked down the car with a straight back and an untamed expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Lin’s expression turned awful the moment he saw Third Fatty Jin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immediately after that, Lin Lin’s expression turned even worse when the Great Sage and Ye Zichen got out of the car as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hanben, let me introduce you. The master I was talking about is this young friend.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Lin’s expression turned ghastly pale.</span></p>
