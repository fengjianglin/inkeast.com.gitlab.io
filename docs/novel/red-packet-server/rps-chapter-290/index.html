 <p><span style>Chapter 290 – Chu Jingshuo</span></p>
 <p><span style>“These guys…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Bian continuously shook his head as he glanced at the messages on the screen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, a voluptuous mature woman hurried over from the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dear!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm?” Xie Bian and smiled at the woman. “What is it? Aren’t you preparing the feast?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dear, punish me!” The beautiful mature woman lowered her head deeply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Bian frowned in confusion, “Why are you suddenly asking me to punish you? Today is my birthday, no matter what mistakes you have committed, I will not fault you for them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman bit her lips, looked up and asked in a testing manner, “Dear, is that for real?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Every single word that I, Xie Bian, says is naturally for real!” Xie Bian raised his eyebrows. “Say it, what did you do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Bone Ring…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened with the Bone Ring?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I seemed to have mixed the Bone Ring into the things when you were sending red packets… You, seem to have sent the Bone Ring out!” The woman’s voice gradually got quieter and quieter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Xie Bian, who sat in the vine chair, also opened his eyes wider and wider.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, he stood up from his chair and looked at the red packets he sent out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was indeed a person called “Bean Bun” who had received the Bone Ring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman looked down without daring to utter anything. Xie Bian glanced at her and sighed, “You really are a klutz. Already, I’m not putting you at fault, go and busy yourself with the birthday feast. I’ll deal with the Bone Ring issue myself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the woman left, Xie Bian still frowned for a long time without speaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Eventually, he squinted his eyes, then sent Ye Zichen a friend request.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen naturally did not see the friend request notification, since he was drawn by a scene in the cold drinks store.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A handsome-looking young man in front of a rose-covered sportscar worth millions kneeled down on one knee and presented a rose in his left hand and a diamond ring in his right, while he looked passionately at the girl in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The romantic scene attracted countless people, but…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone was stunned when they saw the girl.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was an extremely large birthmark on the girl’s face. If that was removed, the girl would definitely be an exquisite beauty, but that birthmark was like a black dot on a plain white sheet of paper…</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was so offending to the eye that others couldn’t even look straight at it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The bystanders had no idea why a guy with such conditions would actually like a girl like that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Li Jiayi, marry me!” The man’s eyes were filled with softness and passion, while the extremely passionate voice caused the surrounding girls to scream.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the girl who was being proposed to…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chu Jingshuo, stop annoying me. If you continue to trouble me like this, then I’m calling the police.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rejected!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What the hell, she actually rejected him? My god, are they shooting a tv show?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s something wrong with that girl, right? She rejected him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Crafty bitch, she’s just playing hot and cold!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, the young girls in the surrounding all chose to stand on the man’s side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jiayi, why are you always rejecting me? Is accepting me just so difficult?” Chu Jingshuo’s eyes were filled with innocence and confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I already have someone I like,” Li Jiayi frowned. “My entire heart is filled with his image. It cannot accept anyone else anymore, sorry!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Li Jiayi rejected the young man coldly, she immediately turned to walk back to the cold drinks store.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Li Jiayi, you always reply with those words. Then can you let me see him so that I will truly accept my defeat?” Chu Jingshuo shouted loudly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Li Jiayi continued to walk inside without any care for him…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You should look at where you’re going when you walk. Did someone proposing to you stun you this much?” A familiar tone sounded by Li Jiayi’s ear. When she looked up, she saw Ye Zichen looking at her with a faint smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiayi’s beautiful face immediately flushed, while she bit her lips frantically and explained, “I… don’t really know him, he is… just…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you so nervous?” Ye Zichen rubbed her head to calm her down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, when the intimate action fell in Chu Jingshuo’s eyes…</span></p>
 <p><span style>It made him burn up in envy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are you!?” Chu Jingshuo quickly walked forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Ye Zichen looked up, he heard Li Jiayi hurry to explain, “Didn’t you always want to see that person? He is the one!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Me?” Ye Zichen was stunned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he spoke, he felt a sudden pain on his waist, causing him to turn around, only to be met with Li Jiayi’s terrifying expression. He could only sigh. </span><i><span style>Why do I have to end up being as fake boyfriend?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m her boyfriend,” Ye Zichen quickly ‘corrected’ himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the bystanders immediately noticed that a popcorn worthy show was on.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The boyfriend meets the pursuer, it might even become a physical fight scene. </span></i><span style>That alone caused plenty of people to take out their phones and readied them to film so that they wouldn’t miss a single second of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the young ladies nearby also exclaimed in their hearts…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why is this ugly girl so lucky to always get this sort of handsome guy with her?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Boyfriend,” Chu Jingshuo’s fury could be seen from his eyes. However, he quickly calmed himself down and nodded with a plain smile. “Then I wish you happiness. Sorry, please excuse me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, he turned around and left bitterly. At the same time as he turned, the action itself also broke many of the hearts of the ladies who were watching.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Chu Jingshuo returned to his sportscar that was covered with roses, his expression turned beyond dark.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That bitch!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Ye Zichen did not expect Chu Jingshuo to just turn around and leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had expected Chu Jingshuo to actually attack him physically, so he even activated Unbreakable Body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he watched the sportscar race away, Ye Zichen shrugged with a smile, “It’s done.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let me treat you to cold drink,” Li Jiayi smiled before walking off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Li Jiayi returned in her work clothes, Ye Zichen suddenly remembered that they were at where she worked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Actually, I feel like that lad is pretty nice, why did you reject him. Oh yeah, you said that you have someone in your heart already, can you tell your old classmate just which lucky boy actually got chosen by our Fairy Li?” Ye Zichen’s eyes burned with a passionate interest for gossip.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Jiayi giggled softly, then stared right at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She did not speak, but her actions were even more deadly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahem…” Ye Zichen quickly coughed dryly to hide his embarrassment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, the shop owner’s call eased the awkwardness…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jiayi, come and help.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Coming!” Li Jiayi immediately looked up and smiled towards Ye Zichen after hearing that. “I need to work now, come by and visit often!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Ye Zichen gazed at the fleeting image, he suddenly felt at a loss, as if he had once experienced a similar scene in the past. However, he was unable to recall it properly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he finally returned to the mansion, Ye Zichen took out his phone habitually…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Bian has sent you a friend request.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Verification Message: Brother, there is an important thing I need to discuss with you.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen blinked. </span><i><span style>What do I have to discuss with Xie Bian? We’re people on completely different levels.</span></i></p>
