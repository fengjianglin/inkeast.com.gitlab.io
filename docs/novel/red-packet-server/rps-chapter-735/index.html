 <p><span style>Chapter 735 – Her</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s hand trembled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then his body trembled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Normally speaking, people at his strength level would not do that, unless…</span></p>
 <p><span style>An inner turmoil began to overwhelm him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I-Is that you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen choked. He felt something gnarling at his throat, suffocating him. Even he did not realize just how much he anticipated the answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen instinctively asked once again when he did not hear an answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you mean by is that you? I’m Liu Qing. Where are you? I’ve confirmed that the Demon Realm’s messenger is coming. Although I have a plan to deal with him, I don’t have enough people to act it out right now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The phone slipped away from his hand, while his expression turned stark white.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Was that not her?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen collapsed backwards as if he lost everything supporting him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Flame Emperor and the Great Sacred Emperor Equaling Heavens rushed over to hold him up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Ye.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Impossible. Impossible! It was definitely her! I would never make a mistake, there was no mistake! It was definitely her!” Ye Zichen muttered soullessly. </span><i><span style>I did not make a mistake, it was her that talked to me.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Only she would speak with such a gentle tone, only she…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>No…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It was definitely her.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, are you listening to me? The Demon Realm’s messenger is coming to the Three Realms. I need more manpower!” Liu Qing’s voice rang out from Ye Zichen’s phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen continued to stare at the phone in shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a while, he finally let out a long sigh, then shook his head towards Flame Emperor before picking his phone up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry, I lost myself just now. What did you say?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re so strange. Whatever, I’ll let you go this time. I’ll tell you again, the Demon Realm has already chosen who they will send down here. He is confirmed to be half-a-step into the Diviner level. I have a way to deal with that person, but I need more manpower,” Liu Qing patiently repeated everything.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It wasn’t her?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled wryly. </span><i><span style>Maybe I really miss her far too much. I’m actually hearing things now.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, yeah,” Ye Zichen came back to himself. “It’s difficult for you to explain everything, so come to the Heavenly Court’s Cloudy Palace of the Golden Arches. We’ll talk in detail there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Meh, you’re so annoying,” Liu Qing complained. “Fine, alright. I’ll go over there right now. See you in an hour.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The call ended.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen put his phone down unwillingly. The very first sentence and the familiar voice continued to echo through his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hah…” Ye Zichen smiled terribly, put his phone down, then slowly sat down by the wall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Ye, that was…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Flame Emperor, Great Sacred Emperor Equaling Heaven and the Jade Emperor all wondered just what exactly was the call about to make Ye Zichen turn out so.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s nothing,” Ye Zichen forced a calm smile, but those words just refused to leave his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He shook his head forcefully.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why does my heart only move like this when I hear her voice?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>No…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It wasn’t her. It was merely an auditory illusion.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Yet… Another question immediately surfaced in his mind. </span><i><span style>Was it really?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Even if it was… Why did I hear those words?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Did you miss me?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>If it really was her. How could I not miss her?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The others in the secret room looked at Ye Zichen in confusion. The situation was far too strange.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the Jade Emperor was in no mood for all that. All he wanted was for Ye Zichen to make the ley line work again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All he wanted to was ascend.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since it’s nothing, then hurry up and treat the ley line.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jade Emperor,” Great Sacred Emperor Equaling Heavens frowned. It was clear that Ye Zichen had something troubling him. </span><i><span style>How could he be so unreasonable?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright,” Ye Zichen did not mind and walked towards the ley line with a nod.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fifteen minutes later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stood still.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He stood in place with his hands on the ley line without moving.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry, can you give me a bit of time? I just can’t calm down right now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have no time to waste,” Jade Emperor frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even if you have no time, I am not in the mood to sort out the ley line right now. Why don’t you figure it out yourself?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Also, let me inform you that the God Realm’s Messenger is coming over later. I’m waiting for her,” with that, Ye Zichen went and leaned over by the wall once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, the Jade Emperor stopped his hurrying. He couldn’t formulate a response to that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He could not afford to offend the messenger of the God Realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ll see if it’s her soon,” Ye Zichen muttered quietly to himself. He still held his suspicions about the first person he heard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Time slowly ticked away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The secret room remained so quiet that every breath they took could be heard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon, a ringtone broke the silence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who had remained stationary, answered the phone as fast as he could.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hello.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was waiting, hoping that it would be the one he wished for.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, I’m at the Cloudy Palace of the Golden Arches now. Where are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing’s voice sounded out from his phone once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For some reason, a feeling of lost and disappointment rose from the depths of Ye Zichen’s heart. It was the sort of feeling that could not be put into words. Anybody could tell his change in mood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll come out to get you right now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zeze, what’s with the tone? You got dumped?” Liu Qing teased.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait for me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was in no mood to joke with her. He merely replied curtly before hanging up and walking out of the secret room.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It wasn’t her…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Was I really wrong?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The others quickly followed Ye Zichen when they saw him walk out. They knew that the God Realm’s messenger has arrived.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, I’m telling you. He was like soooo sad.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing giggled as she sat on top of the throne in the Cloudy Palace of the Golden Arches. However, she was not alone. Another person stood beside her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did you have to trick him?” Liu Qing’s companion was rather annoyed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmph, he’s always flirting with new girls. You know that he had so many girls by his side in the Modern Realm and he even got a new one here! How could we not make him know his place?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t care. I’m happy as long as he holds me even in the tiniest part of his heart.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re helpless,” Liu Qing shrugged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, a person walked in through a side door to the palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The figure had his head lowered as was slugging along like a lifeless zombie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You were so slow, I’ve waited for you for so long!” Liu Qing jumped off the chair and in front of Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked up with a forced smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t just see Liu Qing. He saw a beautiful figure standing behind Liu Qing, who was smiling at him tearfully…</span></p>
