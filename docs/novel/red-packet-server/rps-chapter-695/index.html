 <p><span style>Chapter 695 – King!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A person acting arrogantly needed to have the strength to back it up!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked forward indifferently at the Fire Cloud Sect Master, who was shocked, while his own aura had become a lot sharper.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Purely from their cultivation levels, Ye Zichen was truly weak. Everyone around where heavyweights in the Three Realms, and all of them were of the complete stage Sky Immortal level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s mid stage Sky Immortal level was not of much use at all in their minds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, cultivation levels were not everything, and treasures could be used to make up for their difference.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter what, Ye Zichen was someone who has learnt pretty much all of the Heavenly Court’s supportive skills, so he was not afraid of the Fire Cloud Sect Master at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fire Geezer, are you sure you want to face him alone?” Great Emperor Yonghe asked plainly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He just caught me off guard just now. I don’t need your help to deal with a shitty brat,” the Fire Cloud Sect Master squinted his eyes and snorted coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yonghe nodded, then took a step back. He was already able to identify some of Ye Zichen’s weaknesses, but his relationship with the Fire Cloud Sect Master was merely because of the current situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He really couldn’t care less about whether the Fire Cloud Sect Master died or not.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In fact, it might even be beneficial for him if the Fire Cloud Sect Master died here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t mind you asking for help if you aren’t sure,” Ye Zichen dragged the blood scythe along as he looked indifferently at the Fire Cloud Sect Master.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both he and the Fire Cloud Sect Master were surrounded by a red aura, but…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Fire Cloud Sect Master’s aura was of fire, while Ye Zichen’s was plentiful blood energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have a sharp mouth. I hope you can still speak like that later.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vroom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A wave of fire soared forth from the Fire Cloud Sect Master’s hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen squinted his eyes, stabbed his scythe into the ground and quickly formed incantation gestures with his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The blood energy around him surged instantly and formed a barrier with strange sigils flowing around it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re embarrassing yourself with just that? If you give up now, then I just might spare your shitty life!” Ye Zichen indifferently in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter how strong the Fire Cloud Sect Master’s flames were, it was unable to do anything against Ye Zichen’s barrier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Fire Cloud Sect Master’s expression darkened and frowned as he looked carefully at the blood energy around him. </span><i><span style>This brat shouldn’t be able to block off my flames with his level of strength. It should be due to the blood energy around him.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I have cultivated for more than a thousand years and read plenty of secret manuals in the Immortal Region. But I’ve never heard of anyone cultivating using blood energy. I have to be cautious, yet, since it is blood energy, it should be limited. No matter how much of blood energy he has, he shouldn’t be able to maintain the barrier forever.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The Fire Cloud Sect Master nodded slightly, then decided on what to do.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He will drag the fight on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since he wasn’t sure of what the blood energy could do, then he would just wait until it disperses. The barrier may be strong, he never actually saw Ye Zichen’s attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was certain that Ye Zichen’s defense was practically indestructible, but at the same time, Ye Zichen should not be able to hurt him due to their difference in strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thinking that, he stopped worrying. He was certain that Ye Zichen was the one who should be feeling anxious.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What should I do?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s eyebrows locked tightly together within the barrier. It was exactly as the Fire Cloud Sect Master had thought. He could defend against the flames, but he was unable to actually threaten the Fire Cloud Sect Master at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the blood energy was consumed within his body, he knew that he would be the one who would lose if the situation continues.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Unless…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen silently touched the phone in his pocket.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Xuan-Yuan Sword!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He did not draw out Xuan-Yuan Sword ever since the white-robed man had returned the sword to him. However, the white-robed man had reminded him time and time again that he should only draw it out in the sacred land of the Immortal Region, or else the people from the God Realm will take notice of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Creak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen heard a soft creak and saw a crack in his barrier. His scythe on the ground also seemed to dim a little.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brat, you can’t hold on anymore, right?” the Fire Cloud Sect Master sneered, but if one was to observe carefully, his flames seemed to began to waver as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can’t hold on anymore, but aren’t you the same?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blood energy may run out, but spiritual energy was the same.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, the same?” the Fire Cloud Sect Master’s gaze turned sharper. He reached down and took out a fiery red pill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Great Emperor Yonghe’s eyes twitched when he saw it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quenching Pill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a pill unique to the Fire Cloud Gate, and only people at the status of an elder or above could have one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was an extremely costly pill to manufacture. After consumption, it was able to increase the purity of the user’s flames and strengthen the user by thirty percent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, after the effects wear off, the user’s meridians would break, and his strength would be reduced greatly even after he recovers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a pill that people would only use when facing a fatal threat that they could not deal with.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But…</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the looks of it, it did not seem like Ye Zichen could pose any threat to the Fire Cloud Sect Master.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment, Great Emperor Yonghe saw the Fire Cloud Sect Master’s eyes. They were bloodshot and filled with rage.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just what sort of vendetta is there between them? But so what if he takes the pill? It’s none of my business!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Great Emperor Yonghe smiled, then continued to watch the show.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The flames around the Fire Cloud Sect Master shot up into the air and seemed like they would burn the world asunder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Die!” the Fire Cloud Sect Mater shouted as the fire from him turned into a fire dragon and tore at Ye Zichen’s barrier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Creak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Creak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The crack on the barrier became larger and larger. Soon, the entire barrier became covered in cracks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Snap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The barrier shattered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen coughed up a mouthful of blood. Although it was merely the barrier that shattered, it had hurt him mentally.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His crimson scythe also turned into a sliver of crimson blood energy and dispersed in the air. Ye Zichen kneeled down on the ground on one knee and stared at the howling fire dragon racing towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha. Die. DIE!” the Fire Cloud Sect Master laughed maniacally.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Ye Zichen watched the fire dragon move towards him…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry,” Ye Zichen muttered softly. Then, a pillar of golden light shot through the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Purity!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Solemnity!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sublimity!</span></p>
 <p><span style>All beings in the world couldn’t help but want to submit in face of the pillar of light!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A king cannot be defied!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoosh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A ray of light blew the fire dragon into two like a lightning, sending it flying back behind the Fire Cloud Sect Master.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fire dragon let out a final wailed and disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Fire Cloud Sect Master, who still have a melancholic look on the face, fell onto the ground with his eyes wide open.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great Emperor Yonghe, it’s your turn now!” Ye Zichen’s voice rang out in the pillar of golden light like the call of the abyss. It was deep, dark, and undefiable!</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment, Ye Zichen was king.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A king like the Yellow Emperor of the past!</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Original Chapter Teaser:</strong>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Boom!</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Cling!</p>
 <p>Clang!</p>
 <p>A fierce battle broke out between Ye Zichen and the Fire Cloud Sect Master. The latter sent a wave of searing flames at Ye Zichen, who responded with... a shield?</p>
 <p>No, a barrier. One that wrapped around him as a sphere. That... was all. The Fire Cloud Sect Master continued his fiery assaults, but Ye Zichen mere... remained within the barrier.</p>
 <p>It was not a fierce battle at all. Rather, it was more like a person trying to break through a rock. There was nothing exciting to be seen at all.</p>
 <p>Yet... the barrier cannot last forever. Ye Zichen will have to fight one day, and when that happens... What will he do? What will he, as the reincarnation fo the Yellow Emperor do? How will he not tarnish the great title of the man who once stood at the peak of the Immortal Region?</p>
