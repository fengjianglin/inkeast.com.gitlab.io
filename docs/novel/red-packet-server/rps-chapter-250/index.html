 <p><span style>“I will try my best to return the money to you,” Mu Jinglei added afterwards, as if she was afraid that Ye Zichen would not agree.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need to return it, if you need the money, I’ll give it to you!” Ye Zichen nodded without even thinking about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Jinglei was stunned, then her eyeslit up even though they were red from her crying earlier “Really?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, this is a cheque for three million yuan! But I want to know what Jinglei-jie wants so much money for! Three million is no small sum!” Ye Zichen frowned slightly. From his understanding of Mu Jinglei, it definitely wasn’t her that needed the money.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I-I need it to get my little brother back!” Mu Jinglei received the cheque, bit her lower lip and replied quietly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened with your little bro?” Ye Zichen was shocked.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Although Mu Chuang didn’t really study properly, but it wasn’t to the point that he needed three million. Even if he was beaten up or beaten until he is disabled, she still wouldn’t need this much money!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Did he do something he shouldn’t have?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He gambled and lost nearly three million!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just how much did he gamble to lose that much?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows. Then, when he saw Mu Jinglei was about to cry once again, he sighed. “Never mind, go and get him back quickly!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Jinglei nodded, then hurried outside thankfully with the cheque.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mother Ye, who sat on the sofa, looked towards Ye Zichen, “Go with your Jinglei-jie, the people there aren’t exactly good people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s true.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen quickly ran outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jinglei-jie, wait for me,” Ye Zichen frantically stopped the car when he saw that he car was going to drive away. Then he opened the car door while Mu Jinglei hesitated and got in with Lu Lu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You two…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ll go with you,” Ye Zichen laughed softly. He clearly knew how amazing Lu Lu is, she was strong to the point that even the Hou brothers could not defeat her. </span><i><span style>If we were to face some sort of evil forces there, this girl would definitely turn into an angel of justice!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“No, you two are just messing around right now,” Mu Jinglei frowned. She wasn’t going to any sort of nice place. She didn’t have a choice to take the risk for her little brother, but how could she take the two students over?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jinglei-jie, hurry up and drive. What if little bro gets killed if they don’t get the money in time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even so, you can’t come with me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know martial arts, and can fight against ten. Lu Lu knows self defense, she can fight against twenty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Due to Mu Jinglei being worried about little brother, and because both Ye Zichen and Lu Lu looked very certain, Mu Jinglei no longer stopped then, and the car sped off from the mansion with a step of the pedal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They remained in silence as the SUV slowly drove out of the city and into the suburbs. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen suddenly frowned from noticing an issue, “Jinglei-jie, did Lil’ Chuang call you himself?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah!’ Mu Jinglei frowned and replied anxiously.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Something’s not right.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen knew Mu Chuang way too well. He couldn’t remember anyone’s number. Also, Auntie did not buy a phone for the kid because she didn’t want him to go and browse pointless stuff on the internet…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>How did he call Mu Jinglei?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Also, he’s just a kid around seventeen or eighteen years old. It’s possible for him to find somewhere to gamble, but he wasn’t an idiot. Could he really go and gamble in places where they gambled with millions?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Although this brat didn’t like studying, he wasn’t incurable. He definitely wouldn’t get involved with huge bets like this.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“How did Mu Chuang say it on the phone?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He just cried and told me that he lost three million from gambling, and asked me to borrow it from a friend!” Mu Jinglei replied with a frown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen licked his lips and raised his eyebrows, “Did you go and find Li En yet? He didn’t want to lend it to you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zzzzzz….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Jinglei, who was driving, stepped on the brakes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She stared at Ye Zichen in shock and raised her eyebrows, “How did you know I tried to borrow from Li En? You know him?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>As I expected…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his lips, “Then what was the condition Li En gave you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He-He said he can lend me the money, but I have to sleep with him for a night. Then he’ll make sure Lil’ Chuang returns safely the next day.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe!” Ye Zichen laughed plainly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, do you want to say that the person behind it is actually Li En?” Mu Jinglei’s eyes jumped. Then she shook her head intensely. “No way, I’ve known him for a long time. He isn’t that sort of person!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t that sort of person?” Ye Zichen smiled playfully. “His company is of a decent size, it’s not like he can’t afford three million. But what was the condition he gave you? You have to sleep with him! If he truly loves you, would he say something like that? Would he give out conditions at a time like this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Li En, what a familiar name,” Lu Lu, who sat in the back seat, muttered. “Oh? Isn’t that scum you hit yesterday called Li En?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s him!” Ye Zichen nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Jinglei raised her eyebrows, “It was you guys who hit him!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jinglei-jie, don’t get tricked by that grandson. He’s a true piece of scum,” Ye Zichen’s gaze was cold as he snorted. “Lu Lu and I were in the mall yesterday, we saw him kick a girl with our own eyes, and he said that he was sick of playing with her or something…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I heard your name yesterday, so I went to threaten him to leave you. Lil’ Chuang’s incident today might just be a way for him to get you. What’s more important is that Lil’ Chuang did not lose that much money from gambling at all, and it was just all controlled by him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Jinglei was shocked. Ye Zichen could feel from her gaze that she still didn’t quite believe him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She thought she clearly knew what sort of person he was after being with him for a year.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could this entire year be just a front he put up?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems like Jinglei-jie still doesn’t believe me. Then I’ll show you the girl when I get a chance. Oh yeah, she said she’s called Bao Xi!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bao Xi!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Jinglei knew about that woman. When she started to date Li En, she felt like that girl had quite the ambiguous relationship with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I believe you!’ Mu Jinglei bit her lips, while a bit of sadness and depression was visible in her eyes. “I didn’t think that he was that kind of person. Then-Then what should I do? Zichen, tell me, what should I do!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course we have to go and get Lil’ Chuang back. Since it has already come to this, are you actually going to call Li En and interrogate him?” Ye Zichen chuckled. ‘However, the way we do it has to change!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, he opened the WeChat Treasure Chest and took out the Thousand Li Tracking Sigil.</span></p>
