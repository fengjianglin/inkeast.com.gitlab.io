 <p><span style>Chapter 208 – Sleeping on the floor pitifully</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Xia Liuli!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Yellow Emperor?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What crappy Yellow Emperor? If he dares to fight with me over my woman, watch me beat him to death if he comes!” Ye Zichen pulled Xia Keke into his arms slightly bossily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t care about it very much.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>If the Yellow Emperor’s reincarnation actually came… and… I can’t… beat him, then can’t I just call others over?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>My bros aren’t easy pickings.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, that’s why, be nicer to me from now on. If you always bully me, then I might really run away with the Yellow Emperor’s reincarnation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You dare!?” Ye Zichen frowned.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Time slowly passed by as they bickered.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen held Xia Keke’s hand and sent her off at the girl’s dormitory. At that moment, she also wrapped her arms around his neck with a bit of reluctance to leave him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Smooch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bye bye,” Xia Keke walked towards the dormitory door after kissing him on the cheek.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at her with a smile. However, not long later, the girl returned…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The door’s locked,” Xia Keke’s face was extremely red.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Ye Zichen’s heart also leaped up, while he spoke out something he had always wanted to say after going to university, but never actually said, “Then… let’s get a room?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tick, tick, tick.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The receptionist at the inn returned Ye Zichen and Xia Keke’s ID cards with a smile, then handed a room card over to them, “Sir, Madam, here is your room card. I hope you enjoy your room!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two of them already felt extremely awkward, and the receptionist’s words only made it even more awkward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen held up the room card as he walked into the elevator with Xia Keke.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Isn’t this giving him a chance!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>There was only a room with a king-sized bed left!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>A king-sized bed!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Along the way to the room, Xia Keke kept quiet with a blush, while Ye Zichen did the same.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although he had girlfriends before, it truly was his first time getting a room with his girlfriend.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Beep.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The room opened!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It was as expected of a king-sized bed, the bed took up at least half of the room. </span></i><span style>Ye Zichen licked his lips and was unsure of what to say.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Xia Keke spoke up shyly first, “I’m going to take a shower!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Xia Keke ran off shyly. When Ye Zichen heard those divine like words…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Time will not wait!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>When a chance was placed in front of you, you have to fight to grab it.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>In less than three seconds, Ye Zichen made the wisest choice!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Strip!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stripped off all his clothes in a few moments, then jumped onto the bed, and closed his eyes as he awaited the beauty’s return.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tata…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sound of Xia Keke’s slippers rang out in the room. Ye Zichen squinted his eyes, then saw something huge in front of his eyes…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gulp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, Zichen-gege, are you waiting for Keke?” Xia Keke said with a beyond cute voice as she blinked her bright eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen continuously gulped, then moved his body a little, “I left some space for you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, Zichen-gege is great!” With that, Xia Keke jumped onto the bed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Ye Zichen’s heart cheered out loud.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke kicked him onto the floor, while she activated Super Saiyan mode once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her tone also turned incomparably sinister.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you dare to come on… Hehe!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then she took a glance at Ye Zichen’s little brother…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Night.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pa.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The lights turned off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sat on the floor stunned. Not long later, a set of pillows and blanket was thrown onto his face.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck, the script shouldn’t be like this.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>How about I sneak on the bed in the middle of the night?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>For some reason, Ye Zichen remembered Xia Keke’s earlier gaze…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He felt a chill at his crotch!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I’ll calm down and sleep on the floor.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi, there’s no professional lessons in the afternoon, let’s go and play games!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The people from his dormitory hooked their arms around Ye Zichen’s shoulder. Ever since Ye Zichen’s mechanics improved, these people would often go and get him to carry them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pushed their hands away in annoyance, then got onto his bed as he muttered, “No, go yourselves.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was extremely tired. During the previous night, he stayed in the same room with Xia Keke, so how was he supposed to fall asleep when such a drool-inducing goddess was just a meter away from him?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, in order to avoid the Kind Killer, Mu Jinglei causing trouble for him, he forced himself to go to lessons through the entire morning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, his soul was about to leave his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen hugged his blanket after sending the others away…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Buzz!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The phone beside his bed rang. Ye Zichen looked at the caller ID…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>They really aren’t letting him off.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey!” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes, then sat on the side of the bed as he lit up a cigarette and forced himself awake with a frown. “Gramps, what are you finding me for!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, he received another call…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Ming!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gramps, hurry up if there’s anything, I got another call here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sounds of argument were very severe on Deng Cheng’s end. After quite a while, the gramps said in a hurry, “Zichen, I need your help here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I truly submit, no matter what, you are a titan in the medical realm, why are you seeking me out whenever there’s some crappy matter!? What is it? Did your operation fail again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry over, it’s hard to explain everything over the phone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes and hung up the call. Then, he picked up Huang Ming’s call.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huang…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen-ge!” Huang Ming said with a tone that was essentially sobbing. “…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s expression immediately tensed when he heard Huang Ming’s words. Then he linked it to Deng Cheng’s call earlier!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll be right there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Outside the operation room, Liu Qianqian’s face was covered in blood, she lowered her head with fear in her eyes as she hid behind Deng Cheng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The primary surgeon was changed to her because it wasn’t a very complicated operation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she failed the operation!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Due to her error, she directly caused the patient to lose all hints of her life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The patient’s family cried and shouted out in a worked up manner. Liu Qianqian didn’t even dare to raise her head and meet their eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, in the midst of these relatives, there was a very logical young man!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was Huang Ming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this very moment, a man in a hurry appeared at the corner of the corridor to the operaetion room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s the situation!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen frowned, while Deng Cheng and Huang Ming essentially greeted him at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen-ge!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little friend Zichen!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems like you guys sought me out for the same person!” Ye Zichen glanced at them. “Gramps, just what’s with you, how long as it been? You’re always failing! If it wasn’t for me helping you out, you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahhh…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>During this, one of the patient’s relative went up and grabbed Liu Qianqian’s hair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qianqian screamed out, so Ye Zichen quickly went over to separate the two. Then, he only noticed the person behind him was Liu Qianqian as he looked abck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you here?” Ye Zichen revealed a look of shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Liu Qianqian also looked up timidly as she trembled… “The operation… was-was done… by… me…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Ye Zichen sighed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, a relative of the patient also cursed, “Who are you? Her boyfriend? I’m telling you, the failure of the operation is due to your hospital. I want compensation!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person that spoke up was a young man around Ye Zichen’s age. From the looks of his triangular eyes, it was clear that he wasn’t a good person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are the patient’s family?” Ye Zichen squinted his eyes and looked at the young man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m her older brother!” The young man straightened his neck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fine, then I’m telling you, the operation did not fail!” Ye Zichen protected Liu Qianqian behind him. “Failure will not happen with me here! Sit on the chair properly and wait for the patient in the room to walk out healthily!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sterile coat!” Ye Zichen called out. Deng Cheng immediately got someone to get a sterile coat for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, the young man’s expression immediately darkened as he snorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop bullshitting with laozi. Laozi wants compensation!”</span></p>
