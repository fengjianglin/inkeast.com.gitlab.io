 <p><span style>Chapter 134 – Love Rival? Friend?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Release Director Yang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two bodyguards beside Yang Zhen immediately walked up to him. Ye Zichen squinted his eyes as he looked at the two of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ok!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen put up his hands and backed away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Zhen rotated his wrist a bit, then said to the bodyguards beside him, “Stay here and protect young mistress.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, he walked to Ye Zichen’s side, then left after looking at him meaningfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Yushi, who was on the bed, bit her lips. Ye Zichen smiled and slightly nodded towards her before walking out of the ward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Director Yang’s method of educating his children is so common,” Ye Zichen couldn’t help but twitched his mouth playfully the moment he left the ward. “The method of beating children is already really low.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My manner of educating my daughter doesn’t require you to point fingers.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Zhen maintained his emotionless expression. If he wasn’t Ye Zichen’s elder, Ye Zichen really wanted to slap him a few times.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why the heck did he have put on that face? It’s not like I owed him money.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shrugged with a smile, then said playfully, “What did you call me here for, did you want me to thank you for saving your daughter’s life? That’s good, thank me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen wrapped his arms in front of him and acted like he was waiting for thanks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the other person handed him a cheque.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but laugh when he saw the cheque.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re still so full of yourself,” Ye Zichen scrunched up the cheque into a ball and threw it onto the floor, then pointed at Yang Zhen with a laugh. “Don’t think that money is all powerful. The moment you took out this cheque. I really feel that you are helpless.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Zhen’s face remained dark, while Ye Zichen spoke up once more, “Do you know what Yang Yushi wants? Do you think just economical satisfaction would make her happy? My god, you will make me feel like you are the slave of money. I can already smell the stench of money coming from you from afar.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you say enough yet!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm, more or less,” Ye Zichen nodded. “One last thing, I feel sorry for Yang Yushi to have a father like you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen waved towards Yang Zhen, then left from the hospital.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zu Siliang, who stood on the side, walked over. Yang Zhen squinted his eyes and shook his head when he looked at the direction Ye Zichen left from, “Go and accompany Yushi. I still have contracts to talk about.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need, Uncle Yang. I think it’s better if I send him out,” Zu Siliang nodded respectfully towards Yang Zhen. Then, before he left, he suddenly stopped once again, “Uncle Yang, I think you should accompany Yushi more. She’s actually really lonely.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why aren’t you staying in the hospital with your cheap dad-in-law and instead came to find me, the ex-love rival?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye ZIchen sat within a coffee shop near the hospital with a latte that he haven’t touched in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, he didn’t like stuff like coffee much. He must rather buy some sort of cold drink with the money.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A cold drink is good.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn’t think that you’re a rather humorous person,” Zu Siliang took a sip of his coffee and said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes, “What did you find me for? Although I’m not as busy as you guys, the owners of large corporations, but I have quite a bit of stuff to do each day.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know you’re busy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zu Siliang would always carry a warm smile, no matter the situation. It was as if he was just a purely good guy from birth and didn’t know how to get angry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I came to find you to become friends.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at him like he was an insane person and said, “Are you alright? You shouldn’t not be able to tell what’s going on between Yang Yushi and I, right? You want to become friends with me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So what? That shouldn’t affect us getting to know each other,” Zu Siliang smiled, then his expression turned sad. “Actually, Yang Yushi has never accepted me in her heart. I had suspected that there was someone who left a deep impression of her in her heart, until you appeared yesterday… Although you appear very common at first and act rather impulsively, anyone would be able to feel that your care for Yushi is no less than anyone’s, you care about her even more than anyone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even more than you?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows and smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“More than me,” Zu Siliang answered without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was shocked when he heard Zu Siliang’s reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s no need to look at me like that, I really do like Yushi, but more of it is because of the lack of choice due to the family’s alliance through the marriage.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen suddenly smiled after staying silent for a while, “I suddenly feel that people like you are rather pitiful. You all became the sacrifices of your family.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kind of,” Zu Siliang laughed softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, that’s it. We’ve pretty much chatted about everything. My time is limited, so I’ll be leaving first,” Ye Zichen nodded towards Zu Siliang with a smile, then stood up from the chair and prepared to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then we are…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Love rivals!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen turned back and raised his eyebrow at Zu Siliang, before showing him his back and leaving the coffee shop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen disappeared from the coffee shop, Zu Siliang said slowly, “Love rival? That’s rather interesting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I feel like the guy is pretty good,” Liu Qing floated out and pouted, while Ye Zichen nodded in agreement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thinking back on Zu Siliang’s performance these two days. It seems like he did not have the cockiness of a rich second generation and was rather interesting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He is pretty nice, but he’s rather pitiful.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why?” Liu Qing blinked with her beautiful eyes. “I feel like people who were born with this sort of cheat are all very lucky.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that so?” Ye Zichen smiled meaningfully and shrugged. “Actually, they are all just sacrifices of their family, and were born for the benefits of their family to be paired with another person that was born for another family’s benefits. These sorts of people don’t live very happy lives.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, I just don’t understand. I don’t even have someone I like…” Liu Qing frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his hand and rubbed her hair, “Don’t be like this, big bro already has a way to revive you. It’s only a matter of time now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I…” Liu Qing suddenly opened her mouth as if wanting to say something, but she moved her mouth a bit, and was unable to utter a word.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at her, then said, “What is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothing!” Liu Qing shook her head with a laugh and floated behind her. Emotions flowed through her heart as she looked at his back.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>She wanted to be revived and return to her parents’ side.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But she wanted to be by his side even more…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s more, even if she was revived, could she even go back?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye ZIchen didn’t think about that, he merely concentrated on reviving Liu Qing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was his promise to her. He must achieve it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, where was he supposed to find the stuff for reviving? He only had the dragon eye with a thousand year of cultivation. He didn’t wasn’t even close to getting the rest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, the phone in his pocket suddenly rang with notification sounds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sat on the flowerbed on the side of the road and took out his phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing invited Iron Crutch Li, Zhongli Quan, Elder Zhang Guo, Lan Caihe, Immortal Lady He, Lv Dongbin, Han Xiangzi and Cao Guojiu into the chat group.</span></p>
