 <p><span style>Chapter 534 – The Sickly Heavenly Court</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What has happened?” When Chang’e finally ran over and saw the heavenly soldier on the ground, she immediately covered her mouth to prevent herself from screaming too loudly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This heavenly soldier has died in a very strange way. Yang Jian and I are going to report it to the Jade Emperor…” Ye Zichen licked his lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chang’e’s expression stiffened for a moment. </span><i><span style>I finally just found a chance to go on a date with him…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm, then go. Proper business is important,” Chang’e nodded with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, Ye Zichen felt a bit moved by the strangely familiar scene.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I seem to have seen this somewhere before…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Xiao Yumei!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Back in the Modern Realm, she had always supported me silently like this. Right now, Chang’e is acting exactly the same way Xiao Yumei did then.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Creak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clenched his fists tightly.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Xiao Yumei was always busy with things for me in the Modern Realm, so I’ve never actually went on a proper date with her.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry, I’ll definitely compensate you with a real date next time,” Ye Zichen pulled Chang’e into his arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chang’e blushed, then nodded slowly, and ran away with her hands covering her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, not bad!” Yang Jian nudged Ye Zichen with his shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled, then pointed at the corpse on the floor, “We need to deal with him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the Cloudy Palace of the Golden Arches.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the first time that a heavenly soldier of the Heavenly Court had died in such a strange manner. All of the great deities of the Heavenly Court arrived, while the Jade Emperor sat on his throne with a frown. “Everyone, what do you think?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We naturally have to investigate,” Leizhenzi said with a frown. “The sudden death of a heavenly soldier has never happened in the Heavenly Court before. No matter what, we have to investigate this. If this was caused by someone, then we have to catch the criminal. If it is a sickness, then we need to take preventive measures.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I agree with Leizhenzi,” said Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King Li.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Agreed!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Agreed!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The deities all voiced their opinions once after another. The truth was that they didn’t have any other suggestions. After all, aside from investigating this matter, there wasn’t anything else that could be done.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the manner of investigation and where it would begin was not of their concern.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jade Emperor frowned on the throne. The responses of the deities merely tired him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yang Jian!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Present!” Yang Jian cupped his hands and walked to the center of the palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Take the heavenly soldier to Old Lord Taishang. Let him see if it was caused by an illness.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood!” Yang Jian picked up the heavenly soldier, then left the Cloudy Palace of the Golden Arches.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Li Jing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Here!” Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King Li also walked over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll hand this entire investigation over to you. Report in to me if there is any progress.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood,” Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King Li returned to his own position once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s that it. You can all leave. Mm, oh yeah, Sky Sovereign Nameless, you stay behind.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After all the deities had left, leaving only Ye Zichen and the Jade Emperor behind… Ye Zichen had thought that the Jade Emperor wanted to inquire about the situation then, but…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How is it going?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen blinked in his confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn’t you promise to give this emperor a visual feast? The deadline of half a month is nearly here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>To Ye Zichen’s surprise, after such a huge issue, the Jade Emperor was actually only thinking about enjoyment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen frowned. </span><i><span style>No wonder Taibai’s comment on the Jade Emperor was so terrible. I thought he was intentionally making him sound bad since he held a grudge, but it seems like the Jade Emperor has truly gotten used to peaceful days, and has already lost his edge.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Shouldn’t Jade Emperor be thinking about the reasons behind the heavenly soldier’s death?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s there to even think about? The result will naturally come to light after Old Lord Taishang and Li Jing are finished,” Jade Emperor acted like he didn’t care, then raised his eyebrows. “This emperor cares more about that visual feast.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will definitely not disappoint Your Majesty,” Ye Zichen’s tone turned a bit cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Jade Emperor seemed like he didn’t notice Ye Zichen’s shift in tone, and smiled with a nod, “That’s good. If you satisfy this emperor, then this emperor will reward you greatly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm!” Ye Zichen nodded plainly. He no longer wanted to speak with this Jade Emperor, who only knew peace and enjoyment. “Time is short. I have to go back and watch over the fairies’ practice.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was in a rather poor mood when he departed from the Cloudy Palace of the Golden Arches.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He felt as if he saw the shadow of a fatuous king from historical dramas in the Jade Emperor.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>If this continues, then sooner or later, the Heavenly Court will be ruined in his hands just like the kingdoms in those dramas.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Yang Jian had just returned from Old Lord Taishang’s place. When he saw Ye Zichen, who just walked out of the palace, he smiled, “Bro, why did you come out?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The deities have already left. The Jade Emperor went over to the Immortality Peach Garden already. No need to report in,” Ye Zichen spoke indifferently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows when he noticed Ye Zichen’s strangeness, “Huh? What happened?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothing…” Ye Zichen shook his head. “What did Old Lord Taishang say?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He can’t determine it right away, so he told me to leave the guy there. But according to his initial judgement, it shouldn’t be due to the acts of others,” Yang Jian replied honestly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh? Then could he have been poisoned?” Ye Zichen frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who knows? Don’t mind so much. I’ll tell you immediately when Old Lord Taishang tells me anything,” Yang Jian hook his arm around Ye Zichen’s shoulder with a smile. “Bro, just what have you been doing in my backyard? The Seven Fairies are coming over every day, and you’re always playing songs. Just what sort of thing are you figuring out?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Making a visual feast for your Jade Emperor,” Ye Zichen answered mockingly. All of a sudden, he began to regret putting together a girl band. </span><i><span style>When I finish it, the Jade Emperor might care even less about proper work.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Visual feast…” Yang Jian’s eyes lit up. “Then can you let your bro get a show first?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You saw it in the Modern Realm. What’s more, let’s go back. The deadline is nearly here. I have to remind the fairies properly. If Jade Emperor isn’t satisfied, then you guys will get punished.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s true. Let’s hurry back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment they returned to the manor, Ye Zichen sprinted to the backyard. However, he didn’t go and check up on the Seven Fairies’ practice, and was merely thinking about the Jade Emperor and the Heavenly Court’s situation.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The Heavenly Court is truly too peaceful. I can feel that from these few days I’ve been here.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As one of the three great powers of the Three Realms, nobody dared to challenge them. Thus, all of the deities were rather laid back in their work, and did not feel nervous at all.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>They’ve all been just having fun, and not taking their jobs seriously…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s one thing if it is actually peaceful. But right now, the demons have their eyes set on the Three Realms. They might actually attack any time.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>If this continues, then the Heavenly Court might be the first to succumb.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, Ye Zichen felt hesitant in continuing on with his following plans. The system gave him the mission of letting the Heavenly Court indulge in all sorts of things, but…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, his phone on the vine chair buzzed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a system notification.</span></p>
