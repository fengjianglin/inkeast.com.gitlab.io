 <p><span style>Chapter 547 – Zuo Hongxin</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person in front of the car was no other than Yang Jian, who Ye Zichen had just messaged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Ye Zichen and Zuo Mo dismounted the carriage, Yang Jian saw that they were completely confused as well. He raised his eyebrows, “Why did you guys come over here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did </span><i><span style>you </span></i><span style>come over here?” Ye Zichen asked him in return. “Didn’t you go to give chase to that culprit? Why did you come over to the Immortal Region?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I followed that culprit over here!” Yang Jian lit a cigarette for himself. “I chased that grandson around the Heavenly Court once, then pursued him around the Immortal Region once. But when we reached this area, he suddenly vanished. I used my spiritual consciousness to lockdown the area, and decided to wait to see if there were any suspicious people passing by here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The culprit vanished here?” Ye Zichen frowned. </span><i><span style>There aren’t any hiding places around here. What’s more, since Yang Jian used his spiritual consciousness to lockdown the place, the guy couldn’t have possibly vanished into thin air.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“The Endless Beast Region is behind me, so it’s possible that he escaped there. I don’t dare to survey the Beast Region using my spiritual consciousness. There are too many tough people there,” Yang Jian shrugged helplessly. “But he wasn’t a spiritual beast, so he definitely won’t be able to stay long there, so I decided to just wait out here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Beast Region,” Ye Zichen knitted his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>We are supposed to be heading towards Mount Biluo, which may be very close to the Beast Region, but we’re already at the border… It’s clear that the driver wasn’t even heading towards Mount Biluo.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen turned his head back…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where did the driver go!?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Mo merely replied indifferently, “He left.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was rather surprised by the calm reaction, but he understood it all when he heard her continue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s very clear that this driver was one of my second uncle’s people. I’m already used to this sort of situation. He might have wanted to send me to the Endless Beast Region so that he can use the spiritual beasts to kill me. I really didn’t expect that his people had infiltrated so deeply into my group.” With that, she turned towards Yang Jian and nodded with a smile. “Thank you, you saved my life again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian blinked in confusion. </span><i><span style>I didn’t do anything? Why did this hot chick say that I saved her? Does she want to use this chance to start something with me?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But this chick is my bro’s woman, and I already have the Third Princess….</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, Yang Jian fell into an internal struggle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it was very clear that Yang Jian had just over thought the situation. Zuo Mo didn’t even do so much as look at him after thanking him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what do we do now?” Zuo Mo asked Ye Zichen. </span><i><span style>Although we still have the map, we won’t be able to identify any of the roads without a driver.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen frowned for a moment, then set his eyes upon Yang Jian, “Bro, you know where Mount Biluo is, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master, the mission failed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within a restaurant in Pond City, Zuo Mo’s driver bowed towards a fat man standing in front of him. That person was the Treasure Tower’s second in command, Zuo Hongxin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Failed, failed. I don’t want to hear failure anymore!” Zuo Hongxin snorted sinisterly as he slammed down on the table with his grubby hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master, this subordinate has already driven the carriage to the edge of the Beast Region. Nobody could have expected someone to suddenly pop up and block my way,” the driver said in a troubled manner. “I just ran back here since I saw that something was going to go wrong!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re useless! Since you had already reached the edge of the Beast Region, then why didn’t you just forcefully drive over the boundary? Even if the guy was blocking your way, you should have hurried and driven over! Do you think that I wouldn’t take care of your family if you die!?” Zuo Hongxin slammed the table angrily, causing the driver to lower his head, and not dare to say anything. “Never mind, I’ll give you a final chance. Zuo Mo is going to Mount Biluo, then we’ll just kill her off there. This time, I will send out all of my fighting prowess. Success or failure will depend on this. They are on a piece of open ground outside Pond City’s east gate. Go and get them!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Open ground?” The driver was stunned. </span><i><span style>Doesn’t that mean…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandson, don’t worry too much, we only want money. If you want to live, then go and contact your leader, and tell him to bring the ransom,” Ma Teng held a small whip as he looked at the several tens of people within the tent. </span><i><span style>I really caught a large group this time.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, there were even a Sky Immortal level experts amongst the group, who was tied up using Earth Traveler Sun’s rope.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I let Ye Zichen and co. run away yesterday, this time, I definitely have to extort them hard to get all the money back!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you know who we are!?” The Sky Immortal leveled old man yelled angrily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ma Teng immediately whipped his face, “I don’t give a rat’s ass about who you are. Right now, you’re my prisoners. Get it? If you want to live, then bring me the money. If you want to die… It’s not like I can’t fulfill that request of yours!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The whip caused the elder to grimace with pain. However, that was all he could do with the Immortal Binding Rope wrapped around him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Elder Tian, how about we contact Master?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, contacting your master and telling him to come and ransom you guys is the right choice,” with that, Ma Teng took out a phone from the Heavenly Court and a bunch of paper. “How do you guys contact him? I can satisfy all my customer’s needs.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s wrong with the open ground?” Zuo Hongxin squinted his eyes when he saw the driver’s reaction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as the driver licked his lips and was about to reply, the phone in the fat man’s hand lit up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Hongxin immediately unlocked the phone, but when he saw the message, he slammed down onto the table and shattered it into smithereens.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re just all a f*cking pile of trash!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, an earth dragon carriage sped along the road towards Mount Biluo without anyone driving it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian sat inside the carriage, and felt as if his entire body was going to fall apart due to all the shaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are the two of you so stubborn? It’d be so much better if I just sent you guys over on a cloud.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have to tell this lady over here. I don’t really care myself,” Ye Zichen shrugged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Mo rolled her eyes, “Do you know how expensive this earth dragon carriage is? If we go on the clouds and I just left my dragon carriage there, what if I lose it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Girl, then let me ask you. Mount Biluo is a mountain with half-beastmen living there. There aren’t any wide roads for your carriage to pass through like in the Immortal Region. Then what are you going to do about your carriage then?” Yang Jian asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…” Zuo Mo blinked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian spoke up once more, “Wouldn’t you have to leave your carriage behind anyways? Then wouldn’t you still lose it if it’s going to happen?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I…” Zuo Mo muttered to herself for a few moments, only to find out that she had no way of retorting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, the carriage had finally stopped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian opened the curtains and looked at the vegetation cover mountain outside, then curled his lips slightly. “We’re at Mount Biluo.”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Original Chapter Teaser:</strong>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Ugh, what the heck. I can't believe I lost the guy! They completely and utterly ruined the concert! I have to capture him.</p>
 <p>Although my cousins&nbsp;are unhurt, they are terrified. Who on earth could do something like that!? What's more, doing that to the daughters of the supreme ruler of the Heavenly Court is basically challenging the entire Heavenly! Those rascals are insane. When I capture them...</p>
 <p>Ugh, but what the heck am I supposed to do? The guy disappeared into the Beast Region.</p>
 <p>Wait... No, I know what to do, they didn't feel like spiritual beasts, so they're definitely going to have to come back out. Instead of blindly going in alone to search for them, I'll just wait here. After all, they're going to have to come back out.</p>
 <p>In the mean time, I'll just check everyone that passes by, and see if I can identify an accomplice or something!</p>
