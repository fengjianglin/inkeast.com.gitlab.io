 <p><span style>“I can choose any of them? Ye Zichen replied calmly &nbsp;in his mind, then stepped forward to look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jade hairpin, jade pendant, dagger, short sword, long sword…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every single one off the treasures glowed with a rainbow light. They did indeed look like treasures from their appearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, this is the reward for you for acquiring the map while you’re not the Chosen One,” the ancient voice chuckled in Ye Zichen’s mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment, Ye Zichen took a step backwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you not interested in any of them? These are all top treasures of the God Realm. Any one of them would allow you to deal with Immortal Kings as a Human Immortal safely,” as the elder spoke, a green jade pendant flew over. “I got this jade pendant from an ancient mountain. It has surprising defensive abilities. Back when I fought the ten top experts of the Demon Realm, it was able to make me essentially invincible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, a short sword glowing with a rainbow colored light flew over, “Siderite Sword. I gained this sword while I was journeying in the mortal realm. It was crafted by a top weapon refiner at the very beginning of the world using otherworldly metal. What I like about it is the sharpness and how delicate it is. What’s more, there are ten-odd attack spiritual formations on it as well. It is one of the rare offensive treasures.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoosh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The several tens of other treasures all flew over and spun around Ye Zichen, “These are all treasures I spent my life’s effort into getting. Every single one of them can make you shoot up to the top. That is so much stronger than taking the risk to join the game, but you’re actually not interested?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Disaster is caused by what a person has.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was a saying that Ye Zichen had listened to since a young age. Perhaps the great ice dragon was not lying to him, and these were real treasures, but so what?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>If I choose an offensive treasure, then a complete stage Sky Immortal expert can just slap me to death.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>If I choose a defensive treasure, if an expert of the Three Realms come to fight me, then I’ll just hide like a turtle?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>That’s pointless.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t want any of them,” Ye Zichen shook his head and smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The treasures in front of him instantly flew back to the altar, then several hundred cultivation manuals flew out. “These are top cultivation techniques of the God Realm. There are ones for every single attribute. Cultivating using any one of them could allow you to get to the Earth Supreme level, and even have a chance at reaching Sky Supreme.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No,” Ye Zichen shook his head. These manuals weren’t even as alluring to him as the treasures.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t possess any of the elemental affinities, so even if he chose one of these powerful techniques, he wouldn’t be able to cultivate them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t want this, nor that, then what exactly do you want!?” The voice was clearly a bit annoyed, so it shouted in Ye Zichen’s consciousness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows when he noticed the person’s attitude. </span><i><span style>Why is this guy forcing me to choose?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>There’s definitely something wrong with this all.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t want any of it. I want to join in the game.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Foolish. You can clearly gain these treasures easily, but you actually said you want to join in the game? Don’t you know that even if you pass the final test, these are still your choices?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But I still don’t want them,” Ye Zichen shook his head determinedly, then turned around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then the voice in his sea of consciousness chuckled, “Haha, you are lucky. Take a look at what they really are…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hiss…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen turned around, and saw that the altar was filled with hissing snakes. This caused Ye Zichen to subconsciously take a step back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“These are Lethal Snakes unique to the God Realm. If you even touched them once, then you would definitely die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Creak.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This guy!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clenched his teeth tightly. </span><i><span style>He was actually trying to make me choose to do me harm!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Lucky youngster, it’s pretty nice that you can refuse allure. But remember, your future path will not be easy. Hahaha…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the laughter in his sea of consciousness seemed to go further and further away, Ye Zichen looked forward with a dark expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment, a poisonous snake hissed at him, causing him to step backwards and clench his fist even tighter.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Mount Supreme.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wow, Mount Supreme.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>The guy’s final words told youngsters to come and seek their fortune, but his real purpose was actually to treat those people as his tools for entertainment.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“This is strange, although there are rumors of the ice dragon being playful, but I’ve never heard of him having such a disgusting sense of humor,” Xuan-Yuan Xiang frowned. Ye Zichen looked at the table of snakes with a dark expression, then raised the Xuan-Yuan Sword…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you doing!? They might poison me!” However, she had spoken too late. Ye Zichen had already lifted her and sliced towards the snakes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slash.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Several ten poisonous snakes were cut in half, and fell to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Ye Zichen also squinted his eyes and snorted, “Perhaps he became more perverse after he died.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Considering that he was still in a game, and he needed to find a teammate, he immediately walked out the hall.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Mount Supreme is truly huge. </span></i><span style>Ye Zichen walked forward as he looked at the map in his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He noticed that the map was very detailed as he walked towards the north. Yet, even walking for nearly half of the day, he noticed that he didn’t even make his way through a tenth of the map.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I wonder where they are and how they are doing!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen frowned. Mount Supreme was not as amazing as others thought. All of them who had entered were only players.</span></p>
 <p><span style>People had to pass through the levels in order to get that treasure.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I wonder how that you’re supposed to get that inheritance. </span></i><span style>Of course, Ye Zichen was definitely not going to take it. After all, he didn’t care much for the inheritance of such a perverse person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, there was still issue of the Chosen One!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ahh, I shall give a very short moment of silence for the Chosen One.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He passed through a small path, and turned around to see an ancient tree. He could see someone there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen slowly drew out his sword. Not everyone within Mount Supreme was on his side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was definitely not going to have mercy if he bumped into someone like Bian Tianrui.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen carefully walked towards the ancient tree. When he got closer, he saw that the person was actually tied to the tree, and from the looks of the person’s tilted head, he looked to be unconscious.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s going on? Did the guy meet a thief? </span></i><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows, then walked a bit more forward…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Gou Yuzhan?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why’s this brat here? I didn’t see him when I came into Mount Supreme!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen hurried ran forward, then shook Gou Yuzhan by his shoulders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wake up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ouch.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gou Yuzhan raised his hand and rubbed the back of his head, then revealed a painful expression. After a long while, he returned to his senses, and looked towards Ye Zichen…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry up and untie me.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So aggressive.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows, but still used Xuan-Yuan Xiang to cut Gou Yuzhan loose.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did you come over here?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re asking me?” Gou Yuzhan suddenly opened his eyes wide and cursed. “You brought me here!”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Original Chapter Teaser:</strong>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Wow, so many divine artifacts! But which one should I pick...?</p>
 <p>A sword? No, I have Xuan-Yuan Sword already...</p>
 <p>An axe? No, again, I already have a weapon.</p>
 <p>So I guess I should pick a defensive item? No, people are going to come after me for it... Although the defensive artifact can protect me... I don't want to stay eternally within...</p>
 <p>So maybe some other offensive one? No, that wouldn't work either. Being able to kill those several cultivation levels above me is great and all, but I'd still get smacked to death easily. So that's out.</p>
 <p>Maybe I should pick out a divine artifact for one of the girls? No, that's dangerous, people will come after them when they find out...</p>
 <p>Gah.</p>
 <p>Fine.</p>
 <p>I won't pick. I'll try my luck in the mountain itself!</p>

 <p>I'm terrible sorry about the lack of chapters over the weekend. I was feeling really under the weather, and honestly, still am. I owe you guys 3 chapters in total from this weekend (1 from Saturday, and 2 from Double Chapter Sunday). I'll be releasing 2 chapters a day for 3 days to make it up to you guys instead!</p>
