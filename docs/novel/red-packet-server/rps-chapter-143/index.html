 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen hurried over to Huang Shengmei’s home, he massaged Huang Yi once again. Then, he only clasped his hands in satisfaction after triple-checking that there were no hidden issues.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not bad, get up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Yi quickly jumped up from the bed after receiving the orders, then walked around the room as if he had ADHD.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can walk now, I can walk now…” Huang Yi roared uncontrollably.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen and Huang Shengmei, who were both in the bedroom, couldn’t help but smile when they saw this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, thank you so much,” tears remained in Huang Shengmei’s eyes. It could be said that seeing her little brother be able to stand up was her greatest wish in life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason she chose to become a doctor was to get to know amazing doctors to treat her little brother’s legs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After waiting for so long, she was finally able to have her wish granted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your affability level with Huang Shengmei increased by 50. Current affability level: 580.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was already completely used to the affability level increasing. When it came to Huang Shengmei, the affability level would just increase that fast…</span></p>
 <p><span style>She randomly became the woman with the highest affability level out of the ones he knows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it really was due to the relationship in their past life as Yue Lao said, then Huang Shengmei’s feelings with himself was truly joyous and depressing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I’m not going to be so courteous anymore,” Ye Zichen patted Huang Shengmei’s shoulders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Shengmei bit her lips, then leaned into his arms and started to sob softly once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen… ge…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Yi, who had been running around crazily within his bedroom walked out, then saw the scene.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He scratched his face with a coy, smile, then quietly retreated, “Please continue, I’ll wander around a bit more.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shitty brat, stop wandering around. Zichen-ge is going to take you to a restaurant!” Ye Zichen shook his head with a smile, then stopped Huang Yi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Huang Shengmei also left Ye Zichen’s arms with a blush and nodded, “Yeah, let’s go out and celebrate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen took Huang Shengmei and Huang Yi to one of Xiao Hai’s subsidiary restaurants. The moment he entered the door, the manager of the hall immediately hurried over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mr. Ye.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm,” Ye Zichen nodded his head slightly. When he saw that there were no more spare seats in the hall, Ye Zichen directly asked, “Is there a room?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There naturally is one since you came,” the manager acted extremely respectfully. Then he reached out and called a nearby supervisor over. “Take Mr. Ye to Preparatory Room 3.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Manager, wasn’t Preparatory Room 3…” The supervisor asked worriedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The manager frowned, “I said, bring Mr. Ye over, so go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The manager silently cursed the supervisor for being so inflexible. </span><i><span style>So what if it was booked? Was he supposed to kick the person with the Supreme Card out?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>They arrived at Preparatory Room 3. This was a specifically reserved room that the restaurant had left for emergencies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The room was extremely big, and it could be said that the decorations were extravagant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Shengmei and Huang Yi were both stunned when they entered, while Ye Zichen walked to the sofa in the room naturally and sat down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir, would you like to order?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm, a few specialty dishes are fine. Just get your manager to organize it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, just press the bell underneath the table if you have any other requests.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Shengmei also spoke up when the restaurant supervisor left the room, “Zichen, isn’t it too much of a waste for us to use this room?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is a bit wasteful, but there are no seats outside. Let’s eat quickly, then we’ll just give them back the room after that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Shengmei nodded as she pursed her lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Huang Yi walked around the room with a look of curiosity on his face, “Zichen-ge, you’re the son of a certain billionaire, right? The manager outside was so respectful towards you, and gave you such a high-class room. Just what exactly is your identity?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Shengmei also listened intently. After knowing Ye Zichen for so long, she didn’t know what exactly Ye Zichen’s identity was either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What billionaire, I just helped the owner of this shop out. I saved their family’s old man just like I helped you treat your legs. That big bro gave me a Supreme Card, that’s why the manager was so respectful.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So it’s like that, but Zichen-ge’s medical skills are truly amazing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had merely wanted the manager to order just a few dishes, but this manager was truly generous…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen felt a bit speechless as he looked at the table full of specialty dishes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eat, don’t mind it to much,” Ye Zichen used his chopsticks to pick something up. He didn’t care about so much, if they really couldn’t finish it, then he’ll just take it back home for Lil’ White.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Qu, the person sitting inside is our shop’s VIP.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What VIP, laozi is VIP, I don’t believe anyone can be more important than me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Qu, seriously don’t…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing the commotion outside, Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows slightly, while Huang Shengmei and Huang Yi looked towards the door as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, the people outside seem to be causing a scene for our room.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let them be, we’ll just eat,” Ye Zichen was in no mood to argue with the people outside. What’s more, he believed that the restaurant manager would be able to handle it properly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He did not expect…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The door to the room was directly kicked open. This completely freaked Huang Shengmei and Huang Yi out, while Ye Zichen also frowned, and put his chopsticks on the rest.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Seriously, why couldn’t he be allowed to eat a meal in peace.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I do want to see who your VIP is!” A gloomy-faced young man walked into the room, while the restaurant manager stood in front of him and tried to stop him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the manager heard Ye Zichen’s soft laugh, “Let him come in.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mr. Ye…” Cold sweat continuously dripped down from the manager’s forehead, when he heard Ye Zichen’s calm reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Young Master Qu did have a high position, and was also one of their frequent guests…</span></p>
 <p><span style>But his position wasn’t above the Supreme Card in Ye Zichen’s hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, move aside,” Young Master Qu pushed the manager away, then walked in front of Ye Zichen with large strides.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Young Master Qu checked Ye Zichen out, then twitched his mouth and smiled at the manager, “He’s the VIP you were talking about?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qu Yaoyang was a reputed dandy in Bingcheng, while Ye Zichen’s clothes…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He really couldn’t help but scoff at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Qu, just go out, I’m saying that for your own good,” The manager advised softly on the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Young Maser Qu shook his head with a scoff, then walked in front of Ye Zichen and looked at him with a condescending gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qu Yaoyang?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qu Yaoyang smiled timelessly, “What, you’ve heard of I, the Young Master’s name?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nope.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qu Yaoyang’s prideful look instantly froze as he squinted his eyes and licked his lips, “Grandson, you’re doing it on purpose, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen…” Huang Shengmei pulled Ye Zichen on the side. From her point of view, these people don’t seem like any sort of good people. She’s just a little doctor, and came from a normal family, that’s why she felt like it was better not to offend these possible if possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The eyes of Qu Yaoyang, who was on the side, suddenly brightened, he thought that he has hooked up with quite a few beauties in Bingcheng…</span></p>
 <p><span style>But this sort of beauty wasn’t common at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll give you a chance, leave the woman and go away. I’ll allow you to live.”</span></p>
