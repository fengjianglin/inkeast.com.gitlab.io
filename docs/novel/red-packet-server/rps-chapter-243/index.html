 <p><span style>Chapter 243 – Entering the Underworld’s Staff Chat</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I have already put off entering the Underworld’s WeChat group for far too long. Although that geezer, Taibai Jinxing, hasn’t been hurrying me, it still isn’t a reason for me to not get myself in.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Lei was surprised by Ye Zichen’s message.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The Underworld does have an internal staff chat, but the only people that can get into the group have an official rank above a Level 3 Ghost Servant. Ye Zichen is just a mortal…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Ye, our Underworld’s chat can only be entered by Level 3 Ghost Servants and above.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Level 3 Ghost Servant?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen quickly took a glance at his Yinyang Box.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Level 4 Ghost Servant!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Invite me in, my rank is high enough.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Lei was stunned for nearly a minute after seeing Ye Zichen’s message. Even ghosts that had stayed in the Underworld for one hundred years might not be able to get a rank of a Level 3 Ghost Servant…</span></p>
 <p><span style>While thinking that it might just be Ye Zichen saying things to make him to believe it…</span></p>
 <p><span style>You invited Only Idealism to the group chat.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I really got in.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at the message of entering the group in shock, while his face was filled with excitement…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I finally made it into the Underworld’s group chat. I don’t need to be afraid the next time Taibai Jinxing talks to me anymore.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ox-Head: New ghost, report your three sizes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Horse-Face: Caught a moe new guy. He seems to have been brought in by Marshal Xie’s third grandson.</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>Judge Cui<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>: New person, what is your official rank? I’m going to make a record of it.</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>Ox-Head: @Horse-Face, are you seeking death? You dare to say that Young Master Xie Lei is the third grandson?</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>Hua Tuo<a id="footnoteref-2" href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>: Oh wow, another new person entered the group.</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at the messages in the Underworld group blankly. </span><i><span style>It’s more or less the same, all of this bullshit is pretty familiar…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But who the hell is this Hua Tuo? Could he really be the Hua Tuo in history?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ox-Head: Why haven’t the new ghost spoken up yet?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ox-Head brought up the case in the group once again, causing Ye Zichen to quickly send Xie Lei a private message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“@ Me in the group and tell them I’m your subordinate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that really good?” Xie Lei asked in hesitation. “I never treated you as a subordinate, I’m the little bro.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why is this brat so stubborn?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wouldn’t I get ripped apart if you told the group that you’re my lackey?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Strategy, this is a sort of strategy! It’ll be fine if you just say that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then alright.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, Ye Zichen saw that Xie Lei mentioned him in the Underworld group chat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Level 1 Ghost Messenger Xie Lei: @Only Idealism. This is my subordinate, I hope you guys will take care of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ox-Head: We’ll definitely take good care of Young Master Xie’s subordinate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Horse-Face: Big Brother Ox-Head is right!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Judge Cui: Since it’s like that, then I won’t record down the official rank.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen finally decided to stop lurking in the group when he saw that most of the people had seen the messages.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Hello, everyone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ox-Head: Hihi, we’re a family now, we should get more intimate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Sure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ones in the chat talked a bit more about Ye Zichen, the new ghost in the group, before returning to their usual chit-chat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen lurked in the group for a while…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So stingy.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>They don’t hand out red packets.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could handing out red packets not be a trend in the Underworld’s chat?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who refused to believe it, lurked in the group for another half an hour. Most of the time, the group chatted about interesting things they saw or heard while they went out to capture ghosts…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>But there have been no red packets.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen decided to give up when he saw that there still weren’t any red packets sent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A red packet suddenly appeared on the screen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had lurked so long for that very moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Poke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received Level 3 Ghost Messenger Xie Qiang’s red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azure Underworld Fruit x1.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azure Underworld Fruit: Fruit from the Azure Underworld Vine in the coldest parts of the Underworld.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Effect: A huge increase to the cultivation of ghost servant leveled experts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The system has detected Azure Underworld Fruit, an item needed to level up Immortal Heart of Pure Yang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Items for Immortal Heart of Pure Yang to level up to Level 4 activated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Azure Underworld Fruit x1.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hell’s Lotus x1.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The series of system notifications was not the main point, the main important was…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Level 3 Ghost Messenger Xie Qiang: I had heard that my disappointing third younger brother invited his subordinate into the group. It seemed like he doesn’t have anything to nice to send red packets with, so I, the elder brother, will send it for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ox-Head: Young Master Xie is generous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Horse-Face: Big Brother Ox-Head is right!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hua Tuo: These brotherly feelings truly makes people envious. However, this old one did not manage to snatch any, these youngsters are way too quick.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Level 3 Ghost Messenger Xie Qiang: @ Hua Tuo, I’ll send a private packet for Elder Hua later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hua Tuo: How could I accept…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen the professional lurker glanced at the scrolling messages. This person who sent red packets should be Xie Bian’s grandson, and from the way these people addressed him, he seemed to be the eldest one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Level 3 Ghost Messenger Xie Qiang: @Level 1 Ghost Messenger Xie Lei, little brother, are you not going to come out and thank me? You couldn’t have forgotten the Xie family’s courtesy, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Level 1 Ghost Messenger Xie Lei: Thank you big brother for sending red packets in my place, but little brother merely forgot to send it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, another red packet appeared on the screen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Poke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wind and Thunder Fruit x1</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wind and Thunder Fruit: A fruit bore by the Wind and Thunder Tree on the walls of the Wailing Canyons on the thirteenth layer of Hell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Effect: It can help temper the purity of one’s celestial spiritual energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ox-Head: Third Young Master Xie is generous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Horse-Face: Big Brother Ox-Head is right!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hua Tuo: I didn’t grab it again. &lt;insert a row of regretful emojis&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Level 1 Ghost Messenger Xie Lei: If Elder Hua needs it, I’ll send a private packet to you later!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Level 3 Ghost Messenger Xie Qiang: Third little brother, why force yourself so!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Level 1 Ghost Messenger Xie Lei: It is none of big brother’s business.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, neither Xie Lei nor Xie Qiang spoke up again in the group. All of a sudden, the group’s aura became a bit awkward. Even Ox-Head nor Horse-Face, who were both rather active, dared to speak.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It seems like the relationship between these brothers is truly very tense!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen squinted his eyes and left the group. When he looked up, he saw Lu Lu glancing at him with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh my f*cking god!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye ZIchen nearly fell down from his chair when he saw that someone had suddenly appeared in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Lu blinked her cute eyes, and pouted her tender lips slightly, “Why are you so scared!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did you come so secretively?” Ye Zichen coughed dryly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Lu outed, “I came so long ago, and only didn’t disturb you since I saw you messing with your phone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then you saw everything?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I saw a little, just stuff like Ox-Head and Horse-Face. Are you chatting with people from the Underworld?” Lu Lu blinked her larger watery eyes, which were filled with curiosity. “Also, why is there a ghost girl by your side? What does she do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have so many questions,” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes at Lu Lu. Then he signaled Liu Qing to return back to the Dragon Eye first before lighting a cigarette for himself with a frown. “What did you come find me for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“To protect you!” Lu Lu smiled. “I just felt two people stare at you suspiciously, so I helped you deal with them on my way inside. Don’t thank me too much!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shot up from the chair, and saw the two Hou brothers lying at the entrance of the supermarket with swollen faces, while they had been tied up…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They’re from my side!”</span></p>
