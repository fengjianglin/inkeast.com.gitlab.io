 <p><span style>Chapter 719 – The New Master of the Laws</span></p>
 <p><span style>The gigantic dragon suddenly shrunk like a balloon with its air all leaked out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In a few dozen seconds, he became a dragon around seven to eight meters long. Although he was still huge, it was tiny compared to the size he was at before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s just circus tricks,” Ye Zichen slowed down when he saw the strange scene.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he wasn’t foolish enough to actually stop!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Fighting spirit is aroused by the first roll of the drums, depleted by the second, then completely exhausted by the third.</span></i><span style><span><a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p><i><span style>If I stop now, then this chance would be wasted.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen slammed his fist into the dragon’s bottom jaw. The dragon suddenly shook…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was pushed back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everybody was shocked when they saw the dragon fall with a gust of wind.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He fell?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at his fist in confusion. </span><i><span style>How am I strong enough to knock the primordial dragon back?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lorie skipped over in excitement and danced around happily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Impossible!” Black Dragon shook his head in disbelief when he saw the dragon fall down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The primordial dragon possessed at least the level of a Diviner. </span><i><span style>How could he lost to Ye Zichen, who hasn’t even reached the Immortal King level?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Scam.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>The dragon must have fallen down intentionally.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The dragon slowly stood up. He was very confused when he fell down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, what surprised him more was what happened to his strength level…</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment, his strength was suddenly limited to half-a-step into the level of Supremes, which meant that he was limited to the Immortal King level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That caused his body to shrink. It was due to his shock that he didn’t pay attention to Ye Zichen’s punch, causing him to fall down after losing his balance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, I won, right?” said Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the dragon did not want to admit it, Ye Zichen did indeed fulfill the dragon’s condition.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t just move back, he even fell down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You won,” the dragon nodded slightly in affirmation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Ye Zichen chuckled. “Then what are you blanking out for? Hurry up and leave, you’re not needed here anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Who knows what happened just now, but I actually won.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>This guy will be a threat here. I’ll shoo him away so we can continue to bully Black Dragon.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You did it on purpose!” Black Dragon stared at the dragon with bloodshot eyes. “Indeed, the demons have a grudge with the dragons, but you have to remember, I did everything I could to save your life. As a primordial dragon and a senior from the primordial age, should you not keep your promise?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was clear from his crimson eyes just how unwilling he was to accept the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was supposed to be his final trump card, one he used up a huge amount of resources to get. However, for this to be the result he receives in exchange.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wasn’t going to accept it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Although you might not believe me when I say this, but this old dragon never went easy on him, nor did I fall on purpose,” the dragon scoffed. “Just now, something limited my strength to around the complete stage of the Immortal King level.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even if you are at the Immortal King level, Ye Zichen is only at the level of a Sky Immortal!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is indeed my fault,” the dragon nodded slightly apologetically. “It happened so suddenly that I was startled, so I didn’t notice his strike. I am very sorry about that, but…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dragon’s gaze turned sharp, “I detest your commanding attitude. I already saved your life when I appeared and helped you block off that blade of wind. What’s more, I remained in your body for so long and helped you to strengthen yourself and provide you with mystical techniques… Demon, do not be too greedy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon was momentarily shocked by the threatening tone. Then, he regained his senses.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This is a primordial dragon, not my slave or subordinate.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The dragon walked over a little, then lowered his head and looked down at Ye Zichen in confusion, “Young man, just what sort of technique did you use to limit my strength so much?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?” Ye Zichen was confused. </span><i><span style>But I didn’t do anything except summoning Xuan-Yuan Xiang out to strengthen me.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, you really are in a terrible spot over here. If it wasn’t because big sis took up office on time, what would you have done?” a clear giggle sounded out in the air. Yet, for some reason, Ye Zichen found it to be rather familiar.</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>He looked up into the sky, then saw a giggling girl in a sailor outfit<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> standing in the air winking at him. “Lin Ru!”</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>The Modern Realm was frozen by Old Man Lin’s hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had already begun to suspect about the real identity of the Lin family after learning more about the world. He suspected that they might have been the Masters of the Laws for the Modern Realm.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>But Lin Ru actually came over here?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Take office?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>So she has become the Master of the Laws here? Then what happened to the previous one!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Zezeze, that’s better. At least you didn’t forget me,” Lin Ru pursed her lips in an all mighty manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen disregarded her comment. He merely pointed at her skirt. “Hey, you’re flashing Lady Lin. T-string. Wow, that’s sexy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ru’s face flushed red. She gritted her teeth and conjured a cloud below her feet, then floated down with a sharp glare at Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, when she saw Lorie, a look of disgust appeared in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see that your Casanova ways didn’t change here. I really feel bad for Susu. I should have taken up office a bit later so that he would have eaten you,” she rolled her eyes at Ye Zichen, then walked over to the dragon with a smile. “Hi, I am the new Master of the Laws here. The Laws here dictates that the highest level of strength allowed to be used here is of the complete stage of the Immortal king level. Your strength already surpassed the about that this place can endure, so I was forced to limit your strength. Please understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So it was the Master of the Laws,” the dragon was not surprised when he heard Lin Ru announce her identity. It was clear that he has met some Masters of the Laws before and knew of their existence. “Master of the Laws, you are being too courteous. This old dragon was the one who broke the rules. Now that I know why my strength was limited, this old dragon shall take his leave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you returning back to the dragons? I can send you there directly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That would be great,” the dragon raised his eyebrows with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ru nodded, then patted his body, causing him to disappear from the valley.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master of the Laws, that’s pretty cool,” Ye Zichen checked Lin Ru out. “But what kind of fetish is this? Why are you wearing an uniform? Could there be some… ‘unspoken rules’ for you people? Did you just come back after seducing your superior?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you want to do?” Lin Ru gritted her teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon checked out the situation carefully. </span><i><span style>Since there is a new Master of the Laws, then it means that the previous one has already been killed.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I didn’t expect that white-robed person to be so strong.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But this new one actually knows Ye Zichen. This is bad.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I must run!</span></i></p>
