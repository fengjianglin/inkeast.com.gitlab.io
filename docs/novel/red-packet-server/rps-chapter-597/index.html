 <p><span style>Chapter 597 – Fight</span></p>
 <p><span style>As more and more people hurried over, Ye Zichen felt like he had fallen right into a trap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A hint of mockery could be seen in Gu Li’s eyes as he shook his head and raised his eyebrows, “Brother Ye, I didn’t expect you to be such a fool. Couldn’t you tell that my words were specifically for you earlier?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen frowned as he thought back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Li nodded, “What you are thinking is correct. I knew that insect was you. I intentionally didn’t kill you. You should thank me since I had someone to bring you over, since I was worried you wouldn’t be able to find Su Yan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How did you notice?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s simple. Your smell,” Gu Li squinted his eyes and smiled. “I had already noticed you when you arrived in front of my mountain gate. However, I wanted to see how you were going to break in. Yet, since I didn’t get any news from the subordinates underneath, I assumed you got in some other way. But I did not expect the Seventy-Two Transformations at all. This seems to be a very high leveled ability for those in the Heavenly Court.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Li continued to smile in a completely relaxed manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was impossible for Ye Zichen to do anything no matter how strong he was. After all, Gu Li had a plenty of Sky Immortal level experts gathered around him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, with the entire sub-dimension as his territory, he did not believe that Ye Zichen could do anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow,” Ye Zichen nodded with a smile. “That’s pretty amazing. You actually manage to infiltrate into both the Heavenly Court and Underworld. Can you tell me who that Heavenly Court person earlier was?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you think I’m an idiot?” Gu Li snorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can’t possibly get out of here alive, so isn’t it fine for you to satisfy my curiosity before my death?” Ye Zichen replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since that’s the case… But… I want you to die with your curiosity,” Gu Li laughed mockingly. Then, he crooked his finger towards Ye Zichen. “Stop bullshitting. Give me the Beast Fire.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“After so long, you should understand that I’m not the kind of person who likes being ordered around, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, a huge commotion was heard over at the prison.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Lu stepped into the air with chilling air surrounding her body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damn Qilin Stone. You want to trap me? What a joke!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The chilling hair caused the demonic energy in the surroundings to gradually crystalize.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Li raised his eyebrows. Although he didn’t display too shocking of an expression, his twitching eyes still showed how stunned he was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You didn’t expect this did you!?” Ye Zichen snorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Ye, that is truly impressive,” Gu Li snorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He did not expect Lu Lu to be cured of her poison, so this truly caught him off guard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, what are you thinking? Move!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Lu was already surrounded by several Sky Immortal level experts. Ye Zichen licked his lips, then allowed Xuan-Yuan Sword to float out of his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sword Slash Maelstrom!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xuan-Yuan Sword floated above Ye Zichen’s head, and repeatedly sent out blades of wind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Gu Li merely smiled indifferently, and released Chiyou Sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen threw a fist towards Gu Li. Gu Li blocked off the punch with both hands, then released his grey wings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmph,” Ye Zichen laughed coldly, while his pair of black wings appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong. Dong. Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two of them no longer used any spiritual techniques, and merely fought using pure strength. As intense echoes resonated through the entire sub-dimension, the Immortal Region elder, who was chain in the cell, looked up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So that young man was actually speaking the truth…” The elder sighed softly. </span><i><span style>I was too careful and lost the chance to return to the Immortal Region.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A huge noise sounded out where Gu Li and Ye Zichen fought in the air. Not long later, Gu Li spat out a mouthful of blood, and fell down onto the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen did not hold back upon seeing this. Allowing Gu Li to live is definitely trouble. It was already impossible for him to make Gu Li realize his wrongs and correct himself.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I’ll beat you when you’re down!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his hand, and Xuan-Yuan Sword shot through the air towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Crap,” Gu Li’s pupils contracted, and raised his hand to summoned Chiyou Sword back to his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The blades clashed together. Ye Zichen squinted his eyes, and continued to apply force through his arms to press down upon Gu Li.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Li kicked Ye Zichen, then frantically rolled over. Although he was still bleeding, the mockery on his face was ever more obvious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Ye, impressive.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, what faced him was another wind blade.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Ye, that isn’t quite right, is it? We were chatting nicely just now. Hand me the Beast Fire, and I’ll let you and Su Yan leave. What the heck is all this fighting!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha, don’t you find your words hilarious?” Ye Zichen twitched his mouth. “If it wasn’t for Lu Lu, then perhaps even if I did give you the Beast Fire, you wouldn’t have let us leave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Ye truly understands me!” Gu Li squinted his eyes with a smile. Then, his gaze turned cold. “But… Do you really think that victory is in your hands?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“At least it looks this way,” Ye Zichen wasted no more time. Xuan-Yuan Sword floated into the air once more, while he punched towards Gu Li’s chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Li staggered backwards. As blood continuously flowed from his mouth, Xuan-Yuan Sword also came shooting down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Slash!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xuan-Yuan Sword radiated with a gold light and descended with a huge blade of wind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Li had nowhere to escape, but… He actually smiled.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Yes, I’m seeing this right. He is smirking.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Geezer, it seems like I need you to act after all,” Gu Li smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The blade of wind rang sharply as if it had slashed metal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An elder with a dark expression also appeared beside Gu Li. He glanced at Ye Zichen, and picked Gu Li up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Twelve Demon Sovereigns!” Ye Zichen was stunned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was not the first time he had met this geezer. He should be one of the Twelve Demon Sovereigns.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How many times have I said it already? Call me Lord Demon Sovereign.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, Lord Demon Sovereign. I’ll leave Lu Lu to you. You seem very interested in her,” Gu Li replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha, you get me,” the old man smiled. “Then can you handle this brat?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Handling him is just a piece of cake!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, something else protruded out of Gu Li’s back…</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was another pair of wings.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Original Chapter Teaser:</strong>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Gu Li!? Why is he here? Didn't he go somewhere else!?</p>
 <p>How come...</p>
 <p>No! It can't be! Did he... did he realize that I was here the entire time? Then... he knows that I overheard their conversation earlier.</p>
 <p>But... it's just Gu Li,&nbsp;I don't need to worry that much. I can break myself and Su Yan out together and worst come to worst, I can bargain with him to let Su Yan leave...</p>
 <p>Ugh. I should have known...</p>
