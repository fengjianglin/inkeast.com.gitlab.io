 <p><span style>Chapter 701 – Messenger of the God Realm</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xuan-Yuan Xiang immediately walked closer when she saw Ye Zichen nod, then said with anticipation thick in her voice, “Since you have awakened, then who is the person that appeared most in your memories? Is it me? Back then, you took me along as we soared through the battlefields… Yes, it must definitely be so.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xuan-Yuan Xiang nodded firmly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen glanced at her without speaking. He wasn’t sure whether he had actually awakened. All he knew was that the moment he drew out Xuan-Yuan Sword, he felt like a lot of memories appeared in his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were memories of different auras. Yet, they seemed ever so familiar, and seemed to tell various stories that were more or less the same.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What caught his attention the most was that there was always one person in all those memories. Or rather, those memories all surrounded the same person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"They had never experienced a true romance like falling snow, but what they had was far greater."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In every single life, Ye Zichen saw new women appear by his side, yet, Su Yan always silently stayed by him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if she had to die for him!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if she went against the entire world for him!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if she knew that he had no interest in her during that life, even if she knows that he had no place for her in his heart during that life!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She still accompanied him and never once turned her back on him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, Ye Zichen’s heart never stayed with her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many people appeared in the memories, but Su Yan was the only one who was always there with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll take it as you agreeing since you aren’t saying anything,” Xuan-Yuan Xiang pursed her lips and danced around in the room, while occasionally posing like she was killing an enemy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiang-jie, stop messing around,” Ye Zichen called Xuan-Yuan Xiang’s name weakly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xuan-Yuan Xiang quickly ran over. Then, she couldn’t help but mutter when she saw his poor condition. “And I finally came out. Alright, fine. Suddenly awakening will mean you need to absorb a lot of memories. That is rather tiring after all. Hurry up and rest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright,” Ye Zichen nodded, then returned to his room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qiu Hai and Black Dragon were both here. Where’s </span><i><span style>that </span></i><span style>guy? What is he doing?” Ye Zichen couldn’t help but mutter to himself as he laid on the bed. However, he wasn’t too worried, since he had great confidence in the white-robed man’s strength.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Su Yan. </span></i><span style>Ye Zichen opened his chat with Su Yan on his phone. After absorbing the memories of his past lives, his feelings towards Su Yan had changed greatly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was very hard to describe, but if he really had to put it into words…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Perhaps it was more apologetic?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t really explain it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wanted to take the chance to talk a little with Su Yan, but after typing out a long paragraph, he thought about it and deleted everything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, he closed the chat and saw that the Red Packet Server had exploded with messages.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: Did you guys hear? The God Realm sent a messenger over to the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: Seriously? Why didn’t I know about this?</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Yeah, I think so. The Jade Emperor went and welcomed the messenger in person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mother of Lightning: ^</span></p>
 <p><span style>Barefoot Immortal: This is weird. The God Realm hasn’t sent a messenger down for several tens of thousands of years. What did they suddenly send someone down for?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Gang: Do you think that it might be related to that pillar of light?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: That’s very possible!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mother of Lightning: That pillar of light was too scary. I trembled even at a distance, and couldn’t help but want to submit to it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Profound Lady of the Nine Heavens: The Queen Mother has decreed that you are not allowed to discuss about the messenger in private. Otherwise, you will be fined a thousand years worth of your salary.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mother of Lightning: …</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: …</span></p>
 <p><span style>Barefoot Immortal: …</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen didn’t get the details from the messages in the group, but what they seemed to be talking about was that someone descended from the God Realm to the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>They descended for a pillar of light?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I guess I can’t get any news from the Red Packet Server, but I might be able to in other groups.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I’ll ask in the battle group!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: @everyone, does anyone know what’s going on with the God Realm’s messenger?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: Sky Sovereign, you don’t know? A messenger from the God Realm came to the Heavenly Court. The Jade Emperor went out to welcome the messenger just half an hour ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: And you just said you don’t know. Why does it sound like you know better than anything?</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Fortune: Marshal has got it right. The God Realm’s messenger arrived an hour ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang: Since you can’t talk about it in that group, you came over to gossip in this one? Aren’t you afraid that I’ll screenshot this and report you guys?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Old Lord, stop messing around. As one of the Three Pure Ones, you should know some more secretive news, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang: Hehe &lt;insert a row of smirk emojis&gt;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That crafty geezer</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen directly sent Old Lord Taishang a red packet of a hundred thousand cultivation experience. Since the food and clothing industry in the Heavenly Court has been very well established, sending snacks was already pointless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang received your red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang: Youngster, you do know how to act. So I guess I’ll tell you in good will.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Stop it with the crap. Just say it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang: I heard that the messenger came for a divine artifact, which is also related to the pillar of light that suddenly appeared in the Immortal Region more than an hour ago. I think everyone felt it already. The ruler-like aura from it means that it’s definitely a primordial divine artifact used by an emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Fortune: I felt it miles away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha: I felt it too, it was quite close to me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: I think we all felt it, but the pressure felt rather familiar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: You two can still play with your phones? It seems like you are having a great life as hostages of the demons?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: I’ll show you. We’re in damn good shape. Nezha, let’s send them a selfie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha: No problem.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, a photo of Yang Jian and Nezha appeared on the screen. The background seemed to be Maple City’s city lord manor. The two of them were laying down like lords with people serving them.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>How the heck are they hostages!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>They are VIPs!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: You’ve been having a fun time, but don’t indulge yourselves too much. You two have a mission.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: We know. I definitely won’t let anything get in our way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha: Sky Sovereign, don’t worry. Nothing will get in the way with me here. I will watch over Yang Jian!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Why you little! It’s clearly me who will watch over you!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha: It’s me that will watch over you!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing the two start to argue, Ye Zichen shook his head speechlessly, then sent a final message before closing the group chat.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Gold light.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Divine artifact.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>When considering the time as well… The God Realm’s messenger should have come for my Xuan-Yuan Sword.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I can’t believe the God Realm acted so quickly and directly sent someone over the moment I drew my sword.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I guess the messenger will come soon!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just like before…</span></i></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Original Chapter Teaser:</strong>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>There was a girl... a woman, who was always there by his side. In every single one of his lifetimes, regardless of him actually being with her or not. She was always there.</p>
 <p>That woman... was Su Yan.</p>
 <p>She always stood by him. Always supported him. Never once did she throw a tantrum, never once did she complain. She was always there for him. Even when his eyes were not on her, even when he valued others more... Su Yan was there.</p>
 <p>Ye Zichen understood. He owed her far too much. It was a debt that he could not repay even if he uses his entire lifetime. She was his creditor for this life, and all lives after this one. She was the one he needed to repay more than anyone else.</p>
