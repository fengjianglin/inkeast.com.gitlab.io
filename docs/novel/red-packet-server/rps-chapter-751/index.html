 <p><span style>Chapter 751 – An Useable Pawn</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone looked at Ye Zichen and Zhao Zizhao in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hurry?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What is he talking about?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clearly noticed a hint of franticness from Zhao Zizhao’s eyes. He took another deep and meaningful look at Zhao Zizhao, “Don’t you clearly know what I’m talking about?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had begun suspecting that there were still people working for the demons after they had defeated Great Emperor Yonghe betrayed the others with a group of people and were saved by Qiu Hai when they were finally defeated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He did not sanction a witch hunt for those people, but he did pay attention to some people in secret.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fortunately, Zhao Zizhao was one of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Zhao Zizhao’s actions were often very comforting, he acted very strangely at times. For example, he would randomly go to places with nobody else there and take out a jade tablet…</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen merely continued to watch him silently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had wanted to see what Zhao Zizhao planned to do next.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Man, Zhao Zizhao’s actions feel really stupid!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s as if he’s mentally ill.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>He’s just focusing on the white-robed man’s status, but now that the Three Realm has entered a golden age, it won’t affect us too much.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s more, so what if the white-robed man is dead… With the Master of the Law on our side…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Those from up there won’t be able to do anything to us.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Or… is it a signal for demonic invasion?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>If that’s the case, then I have nothing to worry about. The Three Realms are no longer like they were before with the support of the ley line.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen could say without any hesitation that the demons would not be able to leave alive if they attacked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Honestly, you’re in too much of a rush. So much so that I’m starting to suspect whether you are mentally ill. Never mind, I don’t want to waste my breath with you. Since the subdimension shattered, then so be it. Now, just go home and let this end,” with that, Ye Zichen turned to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t make everything completely clear. While other people might not know the meaning behind his words, Zhao Zizhao definitely understood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While he might be a spy the demons left amongst them, Ye Zichen could still make use of him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hah, don’t disappoint me.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s departure made countless people confused. They glanced at Zhao Zizhao in an attempt to find something out from them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xihe, let’s go,” Zhao Zizhao ignored the people looking at him. He grabbed Lin Xihe’s arm, then walked away.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He knows. Definitely.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s meaningful smile filled Zhao Zizhao’s mind while he started to head back.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>How did he find out?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao Zizhao was extremely nervous and confused, he could not comprehend why Ye Zichen didn’t point him out when he was already being suspected.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Does he not want to cause any panic?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But with his influence…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>No matter how convincing I argued back, they would all stand on his side.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Zizhao, why did you say those things just now?” Lin Xihe couldn’t help but ask after they left. “Even I couldn’t stand what you said anymore. It’s like you were trying to cause trouble.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I really did misspeak just now,” Zhao Zizhao put on an apologetic look. “But for some reason, I don’t like that brat. My bad though, I said too much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Seriously…” Lin Xihe shook her head. She understood that Zhao Zizhao didn’t really like Ye Zichen due to the influence of his younger brother.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more his explanation did make sense, so she could only shake her head with a sigh, “No matter what, he is the reincarnation of the Yellow Emperor. It’s better for you to hide those feelings and not cause trouble for us. I don’t want you to anger him, it’ll be bad for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Got it, I’ll keep that in mind,” Zhao Zizhao pulled Lin Xihe into his arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Xihe blushed and whispered, “When are we getting married?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just wait a bit longer. I want to give you the best wedding after everything settles down,” Zhao Zizhao smiled, while darkness flashed across his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s time to contact those people.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Ye,” Flame Emperor caught up to Ye Zichen the moment he entered Maple City.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re just going to leave that place like that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why not? Do you think I can do anything about the spatial collapse?” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes, then covered his face and continued forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Flame Emperor followed closely behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon, when they neared the manor, Ye Zichen turned around speechlessly, “I said I’m going to leave it, why are you still following me? Don’t you have anything better to do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What you said over there…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did I say?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tell me the truth, is he working for the demons?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So there’s a smart person here.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shook his head with a chuckle, but didn’t confirm Flame Emperor’s suspicions, “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How can you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s phone’s notification rang before Flame Emperor could say anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen frowned slightly. He really wanted to turn his phone off, but this was not the first time the thought popped up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was getting way too annoying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Six months earlier, the Jade Emperor went over to where the ley line was to try and break through, then dumped the matters of the Heavenly Court to Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t mind it too much at first, but as time passed by, he was getting truly annoyed. Meanwhile, he started to develop more respect for the Jade Emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There really was too much going on with the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>People would ask his opinions for all sorts of things all the time, and even after he said that he would leave all the decision making to the deities, they still continued to bother him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The Jade Emperor seriously screwed me over.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>He said he would need less than a month to break through and become a supreme, but it’s already been six months.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s more, I’m of the Immortal Region and I can’t even be bothered with the crap there. I can’t believe I have to work hard with the stupid stuff at the Heavenly Court.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen really wanted to just give up on it, but he did promise the Jade Emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen reluctantly took out his phone and looked at the notification lazily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, his expression drastically changed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you listen to what I said just now?” Flame Emperor frowned. When he noticed Ye Zichen’s face, he couldn’t help but ask. “What is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothing,” Ye Zichen smirked, then raised his eyebrows. “I’m going to go to the Heavenly Court now. You coming?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What for?” Flame Emperor said in confusion, but that confusion quickly disappeared. “D-Did he break through?”</span></p>
