 <p><span style>“What’s happened to Liu’er-jie? She doesn’t seem like she’s in a good mood at all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke couldn’t help muttering when she saw Su Liu’er abducting Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Lady, we shouldn’t stick our noses the dragon elder grabbed Xia Keke’s hand, then the pair left immediately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhuge Hong and the Jail King also took Lil’ White and Zhuge Kongming away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young lady Zuo Mo, I am Wei Chen, Ye Zichen’s number one fighter. A senior said that you will face danger as you return, so I was sent to escort you back,” Wei Chen walked over with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Mo looked towards Yang Jian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s true. I’ll be escorting you back as well. We will not be leaving before you return to your clan,” Yang Jian nodded with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Mo also nodded, “Then please do.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what about the two of us?” Third Fatty Jin wrapped his arm around Gou Yuzhan’s shoulders and smiled wryly. “You guys all have places to go, but what about us!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You go back to the Immortal Region. That ahoge is going with the monkey,” Yang Jian rolled his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Iron Bull walked over with a fierce glare on his face, “Why hasn’t my young master come out!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Liu’er-jie, where are you taking me?” Ye Zichen asked as he was dragged through the sky by Su Liu’er.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shut up!” Su Liu’er shouted angrily at Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen peeked at her angry expression, then thought about it for a moment before deciding to obey her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within an hour, they arrived at the land of the fox yaos.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Get in there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She shoved Ye Zichen into a girl’s bedroom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who fell down on the floor, looked around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The arrangement of the room looked rather familiar, for some reason, he seems to feel like he had entered the same kind of room while in the Modern Realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was when he noticed the picture frame at the dressing table.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This is Su Yan’s room!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stood up from the ground when he saw the photo in the frame containing him, Xia Keke and Su Yan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where’s Su Yan?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“See for yourself!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slam.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Liu’er threw a jade tablet towards Ye Zichen angrily. The moment Ye Zichen grasped it, an image appeared in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, Ye Zichen. Long time no see, I’ve missed you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person who appeared was a man who was smiling towards him as he sat in a chair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Li.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s him again!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve really missed you greatly. There was no helping it, so I could only use some tricks to be able to see you. Look…” with that, Gu Li shifted the scene sidewards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What exactly are you? Why did you trick me!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s your fault that you were stupid. You just believed it when I said that I would take you to see Ye Zichen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Su Yan!” Ye Zichen exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Gu Li lifted Su Yan’s chin. “Watch this place properly. I’m going to send Ye Zichen a video. You better act a bit more pitiful so that he’ll tremble in anger. Hahaha…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, don’t come, he…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Li slapped Su Yan’s face, then snapped his fingers. Two black-robed men immediately appeared in front of Su Yan and gagged Su Yan’s mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, how is it? Do you like this surprise I have for you? Believe me, my surprises never disappoint.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Creak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clenched his fist tightly, while Gu Li continued to speak in the video.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you want to see her, then come to the Howling Valley three days after you see this video. Oh yeah, don’t bring anyone else, I’ve very cowardly. My hands might tremble, causing me to kill Su Yan if there are too many people. Oh yeah, bring the beast fire you got in Mount Supreme. Don’t say that you don’t have it. I’m sure you definitely got it in Mount Supreme!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So despicable!” Ye Zichen cursed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Li, who was in the video, chuckled. “You must be saying that I’m despicable. Hahaha, thank you for your praise. Alright, the tablet can’t store too much information. If you want to see this woman safe, then come to the Howling Valley three days from now. See you then.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shattered the jade tablet with his hand. When he looked up and saw Su Liu’er’s dark expression…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Liu’er-jie, sorry. This is all on me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just how long do you want to torture lil’ sis for!?” Su Liu’er shouted at Ye Zichen with a cold glare. “Back then, she died and reincarnated in order to protect you. Ever since then, lil’ sis has always followed you in all her lives. Yet, no matter which one of them it was, she’s never had a good ending. You are the scourge, why must you continually torture my little sister? Lord Yellow Emperor, I’m begging you, I, Su Liu’er, is even keeling down right now. Can you go and torture someone else?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Liu’er trembled as she begged Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, Ye Zichen’s lips merely murmured, and only managed to reply with one word. “Sorry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Apologize, all you know is how to apologize. Back when you were the Yellow Emperor, you also just said sorry when you brought my sister back. Just what do you want from us? I’m asking you, just what do you want!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Raging spiritual energy knocked Ye Zichen into the wall, causing him to cough up a mouthful of blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen merely silently stood up and wiped away the blood dribbling from the corner of his mouth, then slowly walked beside Su Liu’er with his head lowered…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Liu’er punched Ye Zichen in his stomach, causing him to cough up another mouthful of blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stood up silently, then walked beside her once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If hitting me makes you less angry, then please continue. But Liu’er-jie, please leave me with at least a single breath. I have to go and exchange myself for Su Yan at the Howling Valley.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…” Su Liu’er clenched her fists tightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the door pushed open. Su Zhu hurried in from the outside and grabbed Su Liu’er’s hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuan Hong followed behind her. When he saw the blood stains on the wall, he quickly used his spiritual energy to stabilize Ye Zichen’s condition.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Liu’er-jie, stop hitting him. It’s not going to help Su Yan even if you kill him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yellow Emperor’s reincarnation, I’m warning you here. If lil’ sis can return safe and sound, then I will pretend like nothing happened. But, if anything goes wrong and you cause her to get hurt, then I don’t care whether you’re the Yellow Emperor, or the Jade Emperor or the Great Sacred Emperor Equaling Heaven, I won’t let you off. I definitely won’t!” Su Liu’er glared fiercely at Ye Zichen one last time before turning and walking out of the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Zhu looked down at Ye Zichen, “How are you, my sister…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s my fault,” Ye Zichen smiled wryly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Zhu sighed, then turned towards Yuan Hong, “Big Brother Yuan Hong, please.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ai, alright,” Yuan Hong nodded, then used his hand to transfer spiritual energy into Ye Zichen’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Su Zhu saw Yuan Hong nod towards her, she also turned and left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After doing so, she walked up to Su Liu’er with a frown, “Sis.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, Su Liu’er, who always put up a strong front in front of other people, suddenly turned around and hugged Su Zhu with a weepy expression. “Lil’ Zhu, just what should I do now?”</span></p>

 <p><span style>She pushed Ye Zichen into a girl’s bedroom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who fell down onto the floor, looked around.</span></p>

 <p><span style>“Where’s Su Yan?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">See for yourself!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Slam.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Liu’er threw a jade tablet towards Ye Zichen angrily. The moment Ye Zichen grasped it, an image appeared in front of him.</span></p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Fatty Qian was unemployed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason Fatty Qian became unemployed was because he had pissed off his direct superior, the assistant general manager and young master, Xu Quan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason was very simple. It was merely because Fatty wanted to take away the leftover food after a gathering, but Manager Xu saw him. Since he hated Fatty’s love for money from the start, he promptly sent Fatty packing without saying anything after seeing Fatty lose so much face for their company.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Fatty held the three months of salary, which acted as his compensation, Fatty twitched his mouth. </span><i><span style>Isn’t this supposed to be an international company? The position was just a puny manager, and the salary was less than ten thousand yuan a month. I doesn’t want the job anymore.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But those dishes were a shame. They were still edible.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>After becoming unemployed, the fatty had wanted to just live off his savings, but after a mere two days, he could not take it anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damn it, this is all money. Every bit I eat, is a bit less money. No, I can’t continue on like this, I have to work hard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He immediately washed his chubby little hands clean, then grabbed the dumbbells on the side. After lifting them ten times, the doorbell rang. When he walked over to open the door and saw his little sister, he came to the sudden realization that it was the weekend.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, you were procrastinating again,” Qian Xiaoqian threw her handbag to the side and leaped into the fatty’s arms with a giggle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qian Xiaoqian was true beauty of 1.69 meters, with waist-length hair; a voluptuous body; a pair of long legs; a slender face, slender eyebrows; perky lips and nose; and a pair of watery eyes. Her appearance caused the number of pursuers she had in school to be able to surround their apartment building several times if they were to line up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, although Fatty looked slightly handsome, he was obese and covered with fat, even though it was merely chubby in his words. Although he was one meter eighty, he had tiny eyes that were almost covered by his fat, causing others to find it really hard to tell that they are siblings. That’s why, whenever they walked on the streets arm in arms, they would be able to hear booing behind them and sour words like “the good girls are all with the ugly ones”. These words always caused Qian Xiaoqian to chuckle, and also became a form of entertainment for the siblings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, did you eat yet?” Qian Xiaoqian sat onto Fatty’s bed, then flipped his blanket over, and only let go after seeing a void of any dirty socks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nope, I’ve been waiting for you,” Fatty cleaned himself up as quick as possible, then took out his wallet and walked down the stairs while holding his little sister’s hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, Lil’ Qian, your girlfriend came to see you again. Zeze, so pretty,” when they got to the entrance to the building, the cleaning lady immediately started to praise Qian Xiaoqian for being beautiful. Ever since Fatty had moved in, this cleaning lady never once believed that Xiaoqian was Fatty’s little sister, and after a long time, Fatty no longer could be bothered to explain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where do you want to go and eat?” Fatty stood at the end of the busy street with his left hand holding his little sister’s, and his right hand holding his wallet tightly as if someone was going to jump over and grab it away at any moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go and eat western food,” Qian Xiaoqian suggested.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty did not object, after all, he was a good child and was never picky with food.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What would you two like to order?” the waiter immediately went over to greet them after they entered the restaurant. Despite the passion shown, Fatty was still able to see a hint of disdain in the waiter’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck, looking down on people like this. Isn’t laozi just slightly fatter, and slightly uglier? But laozi’s little sister’s pretty, so damn you.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty sat down bitterly. Then, when the food arrived, then immediately started to wolf down everything. Meanwhile, Qian Xiaoqian acted more like a waitress, as she handed him tissues and water.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck, a damn fatty eating in a restaurant is actually bringing a prostitute along now. Hey, you, come over here, how much is he paying ya’? I’ll give you double,” Six people rushed into the restaurant, and a glasses-wearing young man that looked rather educated out of them pointed towards Qian Xiaoqian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damn, someone’s treating us for the meal again,” Fatty’s mouth was full of food as he muttered. Qian Xiaoqian merely smiled silently, then finally sat down and ate slowly when she noticed that Fatty no longer ate as if he was a starved man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damn bitch, we bros are telling you to come over. Didn’t you hear us?” When another young man saw that Qian Xiaoqian ignored them, he immediately felt like they lost a lot of face, so he walked over and grabbed towards Qian Xiaoqian’s collar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re seeking death,” Fatty’s mouth did not stop, but the chair underneath his butt suddenly flew out and smashed onto the outstretched arm. The young man let out a terrible scream, then laid on the floor and howled as he held his arm, which had already bent into a strange shape.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, everyone else took a deep breath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good, as expected of someone with their bird out. You’re fierce enough,” seeing his companion get hurt, not only did the young man in the lead get angry, he actually praised Fatty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The restaurant manager wanted to go up and talk everyone out of it, but was sent back by a single glare from the young man in the lead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Follow me from now on, then we’ll leave this incident at this. How about that?” the young man acted like a big boss and waited for Fatty to run over crying that he finally met a good master.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck, are you retarded?” Fatty immediately tilted his head and stared for a while, before muttering the words after he swallowed the food in his mouth, causing the young man’s expression to instantly change.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fine, you’ve got guts. Go, break him. Oh, don’t hurt the girl, I have to go back and feel good,” the young man pushed his glasses up and pointed with a commanding might. The four subordinates behind him immediately rushed over to Fatty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The fight should have started ages ago,” Fatty twitched his mouth, and waved the chair in his hand and charged towards the four young men.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“One, two…” Qian Xiaoqian continued to stay seated, and muttered something calmly as she ate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man who bumped into Fatty flew out as if he bumped into a speeding car. He glided five or six meters in the air before falling down heavily and breaking a table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty used the chair in his hand, and smashed. Bang, bang. Two other people laid on the floor and held their heads in pain without daring to get up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go f*ck your mom,” the final person was given a flying kick by Fatty on the chest, causing him to fly back ten-odd meters and hit a wall. Then, only after several seconds of being stuck onto the wall did he fall down and stop moving.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You-You…” the young man in the lead pointed at Fatty with eyes filled with terror.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Me? What about me? You’re going to break me?” Fatty twisted the chair like a rope, then asked with a vicious smile in front of the young man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My-My cousin is the deputy commissioner of the police department. If you dare to touch me, then my cousin will never let you go,” the young man replied sternly and finally brought up his backing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Deputy Commissioner of the Police Department? Heh. Heh,” Fatty snorted coldly twice, then chucked the chair away. Then, before the joy in the young man’s eyes completely formed, Fatty punched him in the stomach.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Watch properly,” Fatty took away his slightly oily shirt and revealed his flab. “This lord has an azure dragon on the left, a white tiger on the right, with a white rat in the middle. If you want to take revenge, then don’t get the wrong person. Waiter, give me the bill. Oh yeah, go to him for the money for the meal and losses. Xiaoqian, let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ge, his cousin is the deputy commissioner, we…” Qian Xiaoqian said worriedly after they left the restaurant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem, just how high up is the deputy commissioner! He won’t care about a small bit of trouble like this. “Since we’re full from eating and drinking, where else do you want to go?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Police sirens could be heard not long after Fatty left, as a police car sped over. There was no denying that these police were very efficient.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? One person? One of him put down the six of you?” the deputy commissioner, who was a twenty five or twenty six old man, exclaimed in surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘’Yeah, cousin. You have to take revenge for me. I want to skin that fatty alive,” the young man continued to bent his back without being able to straighten it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A fatty? What does he look like?” the deputy commissioner quickly asked in surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn’t see him clearly, but he has tattoos on him, so we will be able to find him,” the young man said hatefully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tattoos? Fatty? Was it an azure dragon on the left, a white tiger on the right with a white rat in the middle? The deputy commissioner quickly asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, hey, cousin, how did you know? The young man looked at his cousin suspiciously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How did I know? You bastard, your parents sent you over to study, but you keep on causing trouble for me. Hurry up and screw off, and don’t mention this to anyone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cousin…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck off.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he shouted and shooed his cousin away, the deputy commissioner lit a cigarette, then shook his head with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That damn fatty, we really haven’t met in quite a few years.”</span></p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>“Uhm… Liu'er-jie, you sure you gave me the right tablet?"</p>
