 <p><span style>Chapter 323 – Erlang Shen is Also Descending</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Forbidden topic.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could Taibai Jinxing be impotent?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen thought evilly. </span><i><span style>If that’s really the case, then come to the mortal realm.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>No need to worry about impotency, come to the third floor of Victoria!</span></i><span style><span><a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p><i><span style>But if I think about it logically. They can change their looks and develop their bodily functions, so Taibai Jinxing should not be troubled by a simple problem like that.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened to Taibai Jinxing’s wife and children?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, I’m only going to tell you cuz we’re really close. Don’t ever tell other people, nor let others know that I told you. Otherwise, Taibai Jinxing will definitely beat me up,” Erlang Shen replied nervously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, tell me. I definitely won’t tell other people,” Ye Zichen replied with certainty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Actually, I heard this from Old Lord Taishang,” Erlang Shen licked his lips, then chased away all the maids and guards around him. “Taibai Jinxing’s wife and children all died in a war!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled over and sat up from the bed as he looked at the information in shock.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It definitely won’t be false since the news came from Old Lord Taishang, but… died in a war, that’s way too shocking.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I was not yet a deity back then! Actually, not only was I not a deity, I wasn’t even born. I heard that there is a realm above the Celestial Realm called the Divine Realm. During the Great War of Gods and Demons, those from the Divine Realm fought the Demon Realm’s Demon God and his subordinates. Taibai Jinxing fought in the war alongside his wife and daughter, who both died in battle…” Erlang Shen said carefully. “In the end, Taibai Jinxing returned alone, then fell down to the Celestial Realm’s Heavenly Court and became Taibai Jinxing. He always maintained a warm smile, but… when someone mentions children to him…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let me put it this way. Back then, a deity that just ascended to the Heavenly Court said something to Taibai Jinxing, possibly about his children, causing Taibai Jinxing to directly kill the guy. After that, the Jade Emperor personally dealt with the situation, then decided to seal the information, while Taibai Jinxing received no punishment at all!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s eyes twitched when he heard everything from Erlang Shen. </span><i><span style>If what Erlang Shen said was all true, then I was truly in luck that I wasn’t killed by Taibai Jinxing earlier.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Great War of Gods and Demons… I heard it from that ancestral dragon as well…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I heard that it was a terrible war, but I never expected Taibai Jinxing to actually be one of its victims.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Taibai Jinxing is actually rather pitiful. He has no children right now, nor does he have a wife. He never remarried, and has remained single the entire time…” a feeling of pity uncontrollably surged up in Ye Zichen’s heart.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I never expected the smiling Taibai Jinxing to have such a backstory. I am definitely unable to understand his pain.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But that sort of pain was definitely a kind of heart-wrenching pain.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen bowed deeply towards the scene of Taibai Jinxing, then closed the image.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Great Dao of Heaven’s Birth consumed 176500 cultivation experience this time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen wanted to cough up blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, he did notice something noteworthy. </span><i><span style>The base amount of cultivation consumed for observing different people were different. I didn’t actually take a look at Taibai Jinxing for too long, but it consumed so much…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It seems like I have to take my time to figure out the consumption rate of this technique later.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, stop talking about that matter. Just don’t mention it to anyone either,” Ye Zichen left out a soft sigh. “Oh yeah, what did you seek me out for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he finally deleted all the messages, he let out a long sigh, then sent a playful message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I heard that Chang’e is going to descend to the mortal realm to find you. Bro, you’re in the mortal realm right now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>How did Erlang Shen know!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Chang’e told you?” Ye Zichen asked. “You guys do get along really well. She actually tells you that sort of thing as well!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, don’t think too much into it,” Erlang Shen replied with a smile. “Chang’e and I are just pure friends. She is your woman, so as your bro, I definitely wouldn’t stick my hand in!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm!” Ye Zichen replied plainly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Actually I found out about this news just now from Chang’e because she left little sister jade rabbit with me, and asked me to take care of her for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s pretty good. She helped you create an opportunity. When a lameass bachelor likes you meets a moe girl like the jade rabbit… Zeze!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen replied evilly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, am I that sort of person? I refused!” Erlang Shen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Refused? I think that you just fear the inability to control yourself, right!” Ye Zichen laughed playfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Erlang Shen did not retort, “I found out about your location from Chang’e!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What does this brat want to do!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen gulped furiously, and replied with his heart beating loudly, “Why did you ask for my location? What do you want!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, monkey went over to yours last time. No matter what, we’re sworn brothers, do I have to go and meet you once!” Erlang Shen chuckled. “Chang’e and I are thinking about descending together to see you. She’s finding her love, while I’m searching for my bro!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Ye Zichen was unable to say anything. Chang’e descending alone was troubling enough for him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why the heck is Erlang Shen Yang Jian coming along as well?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Is there something wrong with you? The Heavenly Court needs you for security. What if the Heavenly Court needs you when you descend to see me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I already told the Canopy Marshal everything. He had wanted to and see you to, but I told him no. He agreed to help me take care of the Heavenly Court, but only if we take a few photos together so he can see what you look like!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen sat on a chair casually as he ate the fruits his maid sent over, while holding a cigarette in his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You… I… You guys…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen did not know how to reply at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing the message, Erlang Shen smiled faintly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, no need to get excited.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Excited!?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>How the f*ck am I excited!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was about to breakdown. </span><i><span style>Is there something wrong with every single one of these deities? Why do they insist on descending to see me? It’s not like there’s something wrong with my face.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It was whatever when the monkey did since he was stubborn as hell. I managed to settle him down with a bunch of snacks.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But if Erlang Shen and Chang’e also descend…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Especially Chang’e, since she will definitely stick close to me if she descends.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I really can’t imagine what would happen if Su Yan and co. finds out.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, let me trouble you for something,” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows. Since the trouble had already appeared, the only thing he could do was make it as trivial as possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it?” Erlang Shen smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can descend, and I’ll receive you. Can you make it so that Chang’e doesn’t descend? Find a way to make her stay in the Heavenly Court,” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why?” Erlang Shen did not understand. </span><i><span style>Chang’e descending in person to find someone was a great thing for anyone.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t care about why. Just say if it’s alright or not!” Ye Zichen clenched his teeth.</span></p>
