 <p><span style>Chapter 482 – Cooperation</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen frantically stood up from his bed when he heard Zuo Mo’s soft laughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She’s responding to me, isn’t she!?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows and muttered. In the scene in front of him, Zuo Mo had already put on her bathrobe, and walked to the living room with her bare feet, and sat down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop muttering, I am talking to you. Since you’re spying on me so late at night, do you have any ill intentions towards me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How can you hear what I’m saying?” Ye Zichen replied in confusion as he sat on the bed. </span><i><span style>This shouldn’t be, my voice shouldn’t have passed over to Zuo Mo’s place.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“A master found me and gave me a certain treasure,” Zuo Mo smiled. “He told me that you might come and find me tonight. I didn’t believe him then. I never expected what he said to be actually true!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>System!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The person behind the system was first person that Ye Zichen thought of when Zuo Mo mentioned a master.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Great Dao of Heaven’s Birth was a secret scripture that the system gave him. If it was the system who helped Zuo Mo detect Ye Zichen’s prying, and communicate with him, then everything makes sense.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just what does this guy want to do!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Achoo.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, a slightly thin man on top of a steep cliff sneezed. He raised his eyebrows in confusion, then looked over at another peak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His ancient eyes were filled with sadness, and anyone who has seen the eye wouldn’t be able to feel pity for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s time to return. I wonder if I’ll be in time!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The system seems like it has some sort of oracle ability. No matter what I do, he will always know beforehand. I know that some people proficient in hidden arts could predict the future, but the system can’t exactly tell my future all the time, right?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Was that guy seriously that bored?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, Ye Zichen, you should still be there, right?” Zuo Mo said once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who had an idea of what was going on, sighed. “Yeah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Say, just why are you prying on me so late at night? I can understand if you tell me that you’re thirsting after my beauty. Young men, are so hot blooded…” Zuo Mo’s teasing words caused Ye Zichen to roll his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He licked his lips, “Don’t be too narcissistic, there are plenty of people more beautiful than you. I actually sought you out so late to discuss about a possible cooperation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cooperation?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was already noon the next day when Ye Zichen and Zuo Mo met face-to-face. The place they chose was one of Treasure Tower’s restaurant. With Zuo Mo’s identity as the Young Lady, they were naturally able to discuss matters without any disturbance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I do have a question to ask you before discussing the cooperation with you,” Zuo Mo played with her hair and smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ask away!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>For some reason, Ye Zichen always got angry whenever he saw the woman. Perhaps it might just be them being fated rivals, causing Ye Zichen to feel annoyed all the time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How’s my figure?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately spat out the mouthful of water he was drinking. Zuo Mo immediately dodged to the side, but she still ended up with a spot of wetness on her chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Man, can you stop it with your tricks?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“To be honest, if it wasn’t because I haven’t been in the Three Realms for a long time, I really don’t want to have anything to do with you, woman.” Ye Zichen snorted. “Stop wasting your breath. This is my sincerity for cooperation!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pa.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen placed a jade vial onto the table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A pill?” Zuo Mo raised her eyebrows, then picked up the jade vial and uncorked it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Herbal smell instantly filled the room, and even a sniff of it caused them to feel extremely at ease.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you want the effects of the Barrier Breaking Pill to diminish, then you can keep the vial open.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Seriously, are you mocking me? What do we, the Treasure Tower… This is Barrier Breaking Pill?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Mo, who was just going to say that the Treasure Tower has everything, instantly opened her mouth so wide that an entire egg could be stuffed inside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is the Barrier Breaking Pill for people breaking through from the Human Immortal level to the Sky Immortal level?” Zuo Mo asked once again in disbelief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded, “Yes, this is my sincerity.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I wonder who it was that told before that he isn’t a pill refiner. Zeze, Barrier Breaking Pill.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t want to bullshit with you too much. This is my sincerity. If you can satisfy me, then I will give you a second Barrier Breaking Pill!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Here? That isn’t too suitable, right?” To Ye Zichen’s surprise, Zuo Mo suddenly sprouted something random.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he saw her passionate look, and pink cheeks…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you are kidding, then I think our cooperation can end here.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just how imaginative must this woman be to think that way? </span></i><span style>Ye Zichen was certain that she did it on purpose.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? Didn’t you tell me to satisfy you?” Zuo Mo put on an innocent look, then lowered her head and muttered. “Actually, if you seriously like me, then you can ask for my hand at the Treasure Tower. My father isn’t that sort of person who only cares about benefits. As long as you are motivated, then he will agree to us. As for now… Can I satisfy you after we get married? Although I’m not that sort of old fashioned people, but I’m still…”</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>“Give me back my pill. I don’t want to talk with a Gemini<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> like you,” Ye Zichen raised his hand.</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Mo replied in confusion, “What is Gemini?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, when she noticed Ye Zichen’s expression truly darkened, she shrugged helplessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What an uninteresting fellow,” Zuo Mo shrugged with a purse of her lips. “Alright, from now on, I will discuss properly with you. Tell me your conditions. I am very curious just what sort of cooperation is worth two Barrier Breaking Pills.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately told her of his plan taking the chance that the woman was still acting normally.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Azure Sky Pavilion? You actually want to become enemies with one of the Six Pavilions for a girl. That is very brave. What? Is that girl the one you’re interested in?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That has nothing to do with you,” Ye Zichen replied coldly. “All you have to do is provide me with support.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Only prepare people that can control the situation, and stay vigilant in case the other party’s strong people makes a sneak attack. It seems like I’ve gotten the better end of the deal with the two Barrier Breaking Pills,” Zuo Mo put away the Barrier Breaking Pills with a smile, then stood up from her chair and reached out her hand. “To a good cooperation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the discussion, Ye Zichen had wanted to return, but for some reason, Zuo Mo insisted on returning with him as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had even gone as far as to use the excuse of she was just going over to see the guest chamberlains she left over at the manor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A woman’s thoughts were hard to grasp, and that was extremely true for a Gemini woman like her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Ye Zichen couldn’t make her leave, all he could do was ignore her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, when Ye Zichen arrived at the manor, he noticed that several spiritual beast carriages parked outside the gate. They were carriages of a level that the Spiritual Breeze Villagers would not be able to have.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have important guests visiting!” Zuo Mo smiled meaningfully, while Ye Zichen’s gaze darened.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Important guests!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Only </span></i><b><i>those</i></b><i><span style> people can be considered important guests, and come at this time!</span></i></p>

 <p><b>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</b>What!? Is she talking to me?</p>
 <p><strong>Zuo Mo:&nbsp;</strong>No, I'm talking to myself.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>...</p>
 <p><strong>Zuo Mo:&nbsp;</strong>Stop pretending, I know you're watching.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>How are you able to detect me watching you?</p>
 <p><strong>Zuo Mo:&nbsp;</strong>Do you really want to know?</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Yes.</p>
