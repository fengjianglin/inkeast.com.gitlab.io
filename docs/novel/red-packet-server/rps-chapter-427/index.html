 <p><span style>Chapter 427 – The Destroyed Wall between the Modern Realm and the Otherworld</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoosh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A spatial gate opened in the Otherworld.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Ye Zichen walked through the gate, he couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What the hell!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The purple mist covering everything was so dense that it was about to liquify. However, Ye Zichen was unable to find the existence of any slime monsters at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Otherworld was a parallel world to the Modern Realm. The reason demonic energy appeared over in Xiao Yumei’s office might very well have been due to the demonic energy leaking through to the Modern Realm due to it being too rampant in the Otherworld. What Ye Zichen had to do was find the leaking point and cover it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pushed open the door in the Otherworld, which corresponded to the door of Xiao Yumei’s office, then walked up the stairs…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ten-odd smiley reptiles were biting the roof, and at that very moment, they had already ripped open a small hole.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen glanced over at the hole, causing his pupils to contract.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Like I thought, it’s the Underworld!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noticing Ye Zichen’s existence, the slime monsters begun to crawl over towards him with their limbs dripping a green liquid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shatter,” Ye Zichen called out softly, causing the slime monsters to instantly split into smithereens and disappear.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>They’re actually breaking through the wall between the Modern Realm and this place!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Ye Zichen begun to knit his eyebrows and ponder about the way to cover up the opening, a huge hole suddenly appeared through the wall, and a pair of humongous hands reached towards Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye ZIchen subconsciously lifted his right hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A clear collision was heard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Ye Zichen also called out softly, “Xuan-Yuan!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A blade filled with endless energy appeared in his hand, while Xuan-Yuan Xiang stood beside the sword…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What a revolting smell,” Xuan-Yuan Xiang pinched her nose, then glanced over at the huge monster through the hole in the wall. She shouted towards Ye Zichen. “Hey, you can’t be thinking about using me to slice that guy, right!? I don’t want to, it’s going to be disgusting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The monster was nearly twenty meters tall, with a body that continuously dripped down black liquid. The black liquid was like the mud in the sewers, while also carrying a revolting smell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not only him!” Ye Zichen smiled. As he stood at the side of the hole in the wall and looked down at the dense number of slimy reptiles. They were so closely packed together that even people without trypophobia would get goosebumps…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“… No way, laoniang can’t take it anymore!” Xuan-Yuan Xiang immediately turned around, then grabbed Ye Zichen’s arm and shook it continuously. “Master, I don’t wanna chop those monsters. It feels so disgusting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen caressed her hair, while a warm smile surfaced on his face, “That’s not up to you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, his gaze changed, then squinted his eyes with a chuckle, “Let’s go. Release your sharpest side, and give me a hand!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen jumped off the building without any hesitation. Although Xuan-Yuan Xiang’s face was filled with dissatisfaction, she still jumped down behind him and continuously formed sigils in her hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Blade, burn!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xuan-Yuan Sword, which was in Ye Zichen’s hand, instantly turned a fiery red, while faint flames covered it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Burn them to death if you can. Don’t use me to cut them!” Xuan-Yuan Xiang continuously muttered behind Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He nodded, the swung the blade around in a circle, “Flame Slash!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vroom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Intense waves of flames fell down from the sky. The slime monsters all disappeared from the places the flames passed through. Within a mere half a minute, all slime monsters had already disappeared from a ten-meter radius around Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Three minutes later, all of the slime monsters in the area were killed except the huge demon.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It was fortunate that laoniang activated the flames as much as possible, otherwise this brat might have truly used me to slice them.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, before she could let out a sigh of relief, she saw Ye Zichen charge towards the huge demon with Xuan-Yuan Sword in hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She couldn’t help but puke when she saw the demon. When she thought of the fact that she was going to be used to chop that monster…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Break,” Ye Zichen sliced at the huge demon’s leg using his Xuan-Yuan Sword without any hesitation, causing the monster’s leg to fly far away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The purplish red eyes of the demon, who kneeled single-legged on the ground, shimmered with a terrifying light. Then, it roared angrily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoosh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A strong wind blew past them. Ye Zichen merely smile as he stood still and felt the strength of the wind…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Human Immortal level,” Ye Zichen smirked, then returned Xuan-Yuan Sword to his arm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, what are you doing?” Xuan-Yuan Xiang raised her eyes in surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked back and gave her a radiant smile, “Didn’t you not want to chop the monster? Then I’ll deal with it with my bare hands!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen kicked off the ground and shot towards the huge demon like a bolt of lightning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His fist collided with the demon’s head. The demon let out an angry roar, then slapped him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Too slow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye ZIchen kicked the demon’s face. The demon’s eyes instantly shimmered with a purple aura, while its body also begun to shrink until it became a monster of only two-odd meters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although it shrunk its size, its strength did increase…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Feeling the heavier pressure that the enemy gave him, the bloodthirsty grin on Ye Zichen’s face brightened even more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come,” Ye Zichen hook his finger at the shrunken demon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The demon immediately crouched, then hopped over using its single leg.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his arm to block the attack, but the strong impact caused his arm to feel a bit sore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re pretty strong, but if that’s all you’ve got, then you’re going to die.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen roundhouse kicked the demon in its stomach, sending it crashing against a wall ten-odd meters away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The demon roared furiously, then charged over with bloodshot eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Seriously, I was actually looking forward to our fight.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen dipped his head. He didn’t even bother to look at the demon, and merely parried the demon’s arm, before punching the demon in its stomach again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The punch was like a shot from an air blaster, sending a powerful course of force through the demon’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It fell down limply onto the floor. Ye Zichen merely crushed the demon’s head with his feet. When he did so, purple mist came out of the demon’s head, and fused with the sea of purple in front of him…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Seriously, so disappointing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shook his head plainly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, a spatial gate appeared in the Otherworld.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person in the lead was Wei Chen, who Ye Zichen had not met with for a long time, and those that followed were the normal members of Tribulation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You came kind of slowly. I already dealt with the big guy.” Ye Zichen shrugged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wei Chen looked at the humongous creature on the floor in shock, then raised his eyebrows, “Boss Ye, why are you here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We can talk about that later. Come with me and take a look to see how this place should be fixed!”</span></p>

 <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Original Chapter Teaser:</b>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>While the Immortality Peach Feast was being held in the Heavenly Court, the Otherworld was undergoing a huge change.</p>
 <p>Abyssals swarmed the streets.</p>
 <p>They were no longer just mindless beings that were acting on instinct.</p>
 <p>They were being guided.</p>
 <p>Led.</p>
 <p>They had a purpose.</p>
 <p>They had one goal.</p>
 <p>To tear apart the fabric separating the Otherworld and the Modern Realm.</p>
 <p>Only then, could their masters, the demons, descend upon the Modern Realm.</p>
 <p>Only then, can the demons all set foot in the abandoned land once more.</p>
 <p>How will Ye Zichen react to this? What will he do? Will he still find it extremely difficult to handle the demons?</p>
