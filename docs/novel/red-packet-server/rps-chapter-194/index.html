 <p><span style>Chapter 194 – Is your surname Gu?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mr. Ye.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Ye Zichen walked out of the clubhouse doors, he saw Lin Hanben and Lin Lin standing at the entrance looking both nervous and guilty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did you guys come here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person that called him just now was Lin Ru. She had told him that Old Man Lin was nearly done for.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was why he frantically ran out. He didn’t expect this father and son pair to seek him out as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have no time for you guys.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In face of a life and death situation, Ye Zichen decided to put his personal grudges aside.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Old Man Lin is innocent. Since I can save him, I have to save him!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Mr. Ye.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Hanben quickly walked up to Ye Zichen, there wasn’t any trace of his arrogance from before anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Hanben lowered his head deeply, while his face was full of wrinkles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please be merciful and save the life of our family’s old man,” With that, he shouted at Lin Lin. “Unfilial son, come over here and apologize to Mr. Ye!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Ye…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, stop your bullshitting here, just go ahead and bring me over to Old Man Lin!” Ye Zichen had no time to waste with this father and son pair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Lin Hanben immediately opened the car door, “Mr. Ye, please!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen sat in Lin Hanben’s van, he took out his phone and brought up the chat with King Qinguang and King Chujiang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Back when he left from Old Man Su’s place before, he already forgot to ask about Old Man Lin’s lifespan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mr. Ye…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t bother me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Hanben walked to say more, but he was mercilessly interrupted by Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since he felt that Ye Zichen’s tone was terrible, he didn’t dare to say too much, and merely sat opposite Ye Zichen obediently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, his phone rang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person that replied was King Qinguang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I wonder what business does master have?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Help me find out the lifespan of a mortal…” The moment he sent the message, Ye Zichen looked up at Lin Hanben. “What’s your family’s old man called?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lin-Lin Yongkang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, shut up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen replied to the WeChat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lin Yongkang, someone from the capital, currently living in Bingcheng!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait a moment…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the looks of it, King Qinguang went to search up Old Man Lin’s lifespan. Ye Zichen let out a sigh, then closed his eyes to rest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Ye!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they arrived at the Lin household, pretty much all of the Lin family members waited for them at the gate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen passed through the crowd like a star and arrived in Old Man Lin’s room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A dying elder laid on the bed. His eyebrows were relaxed, but the torture of his sickness had caused his entire face to turn beyond pale.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, there was a faint stench from the old man’s body, which continuously sweated at the armpits.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen let out a sigh, and looked at Lin Hanben with squinted eyes using this chance…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Lin Hanben didn’t even dare to breathe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Never mind, I get angry whenever I see you, same with your darling son… Go out and leave here to me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When everyone left the room, Ye Zichen stood in front of Old Man Lin and knitted his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The five failures appeared on him. </span></i><span style><span><a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p><i><span style>When this sort of situation occurs, it means that their time was up. No one would be able to save him.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Even if Ye Zichen does have Old Lord Taishang’s special medical journal, he was unable to save someone whose time was up at all…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only choice he had was the Underworld.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, the phone in his pocket rang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master, I found out about the person you asked me to check. He still have 15 minutes left to live.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Fifteen minutes.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen squinted his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Help me add five years of lifespan for him.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Adding lifespan once again…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>King Qinguang didn’t reply for quite a while when he saw the message. He was still feeling worried about the time when he added fifty years of lifespan for Yang Yushi the previous time…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just how long has it been? And he wants to add lifespan once again!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>If the Heavenly Court finds out…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s more, this was against the natural order of things!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Master!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know what you’re worried about,” It wasn’t really a good method to always get the Underworld to add lifespan, but he really had no other choice. “Help me one more time, I’ll remember this favor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then-Then I’ll make an exception for the master!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, King Qinguang sent another message over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The lifespan has been added.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen let out a soft sigh when he saw the news.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It seems like I owe him a favor.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>After the lifespan was added, Lin Yongkang’s breathing stabilized and the sweat under his armpits begun to slowly disappear along with the stench from his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Judging from the situation with Yang Yushi, Old Man Lin should soon awaken without any surprises.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, five or six minutes passed, but Ye Zichen still did not see any signs of him awakening.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Lifespan was indeed added.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But this…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen frowned, so he reached his hand out towards Old Man Lin’s wrist…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The instant he grabbed onto the dry wrist, he immediately frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The meridians in Old Man Lin’s body were in complete chaos, they were all entwined with one another…</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was clear that that was the reason why Old Man Lin had not awakened.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That was it!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The qi from Ye Zichen’s fingers gradually entered Old Man Lin’s meridians. It was fine for the meridians to be messed up in other areas, but Ye Zichen had to clean up the meridians around Old Man Lin’s heart first…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cough, cough…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After an hour passed, Ye Zichen’s forehead had become covered with sweat. At that moment, Old Man Lin, who was lying on the bed, also started to cough intensely, while his blurry eyes begun to open.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Man Lin.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen used his hand to wipe away the sweat on his forehead, while Old Man Lin smiled weakly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You yanked this old man back from the gates of the afterlife?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes,” Ye Zichen nodded and looked at the old man, who was lying on the bed, “Old Man Lin, I just checked your body, your situation is terrible… If you want to be treated, then I have to shatter and reconstruct all the meridians in your body…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh?” Old Man Lin’s blurry eyes flashed. “You can cure me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I’ll be troubling little friend!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But it will hurt a bit…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pain of shattering all the meridians in their body was not something that a normal person endure. He must inform the old man of that beforehand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No worries, I’ve suffered far too much pain in these years,” Old Man Lin smiled weakly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then… Sorry,” Ye Zichen held Old Man Lin’s arm, while he continuously sent the qi from his hand crashing against Old Man Lin’s meridians.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young man, you’re very much like an old friend of mine…” At that moment, Old Man Lin suddenly spoke up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that so?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen admired Old Man Lin rather much. He had already shattered all of the latter’s meridians, but the old man’s face didn’t show anything at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, very much so!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Man Lin smiled. At the same time, Ye Zichen also controlled his qi to quickly reconstruct Old Man Lin’s meridians, and also took out a healing pill from the Heavenly Court, which he placed in the old man’s mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The old man was clearly stunned when the pill entered his mouth…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, he sat up from the bed. As he felt the long-awaited strength, he squinted his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I wonder if little friend’s surname is Gu…”</span></p>
