 <p><span style>Chapter 404 – The Person Causing the Corruption</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen swept his gaze over Zhu Yunbai. </span><i><span style>It’s still his familiar face…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But he’s really changed a lot.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Yo, Fifth Bro’s here too,” Zhu Yunbai wiped the corner of his mouth with his hand, then squinted at Ye Zichen. “What a rare guest, but sorry, I didn’t bring Fifth Bro’s present.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded slightly, then patted Zhu Yunbai’s shoulder with a chuckle, “Lil’ Bro, you got far.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha… You’re so fake,” Zhu Yunbai laughed, then smiled with a shrug. “You are definitely the thinking the same thing as them, right? You feel like I’m very inhuman?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The mockery on Zhu Yunbai’s mouth caused Ye Zichen to stiffen. Since Kang Peng’s clenched fist had not yet relaxed, he raised his fist and wanted to hit Zhu Yunbai once again after hearing his words…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Never mind,” Ye Zichen grabbed Kang Peng’s arm and shook his head. He took a step back, and pursed his lips with a smile. “Go, I wish you a bright and wealthy future!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, everybody turned away from the entrance to the room. Right after doing so, Kang Peng also made sure to kick the presents Zhu Yunbai brought over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Take your crappy stuff away, we have no interest in it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe…” Zhu Yunbai bent down to pick up the shopping bags on the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Guo Jing suddenly appeared outside their dorm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her beautiful face was covered with a hint of curiosity, as she wrapped her arms around Zhu Yunbai’s arm, “Why did you take so long? I waited ages for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhu Yunbai turned around and caressed Guo Jing’s hair with a smile, “It’ll naturally take longer to say my farewells to my roommates. Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, they turned around and left without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A while after they left, Kang Peng suddenly picked up the photo frame near his computer and smashed it onto the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The phone frame held a photo of the six of them in the dorm. Within the photo, Zhu Yunbai stood right next to Kang Peng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He f*cking changed!” Kang Peng threw a tantrum in the room with bloodshot eyes, while Bai Yu held a cigarette in his mouth, and looked at the photo in the cracked frame as well. All of a moment, the atmosphere became silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen didn’t know what to say either. </span><i><span style>Can money really change people so much?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, that grandson left, right? The figure I saw outside just now seemed like him,” Zhang Rui walked back into the room, and noticed the photo underneath Kang Peng’s feet. “You got into a fight?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t f*cking mention him to me anymore. Laozi will treat it as if he died!” Kang Peng clenched his fist and cursed. He was the one who valued their relationship the most in the dorm. Even after Zhu Yunbai had changed, he still tried and make excuses for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Zhu Yunbai’s actions this time truly pissed him off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright now, there’s no need to be so angry. It’ll pass eventually. He is in a better economic situation now, so isn’t it normal for him to move out? Don’t Ol’ Three and I come back often?” Ye Zichen couldn’t help but speak up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Zhang Rui smiled and twitched his mouth, “Is he the same as you guys? You and Ol’ Three do have money, but did it affect our relationship? This grandson, Zhu Yunbai, I don’t want to talk about him anymore…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhang Rui stretched lazily, then jumped onto his bed, “I’m tired, so I’m going to take a nap. Laozi’s going to wait for the day he comes crying back to the dorm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, within a sports car outside the school.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhu Yunbai sat in the front seat sullenly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Jing, who only just buckled her seat belt, noticed the marks Kang Peng left on his face, “What happened to your face?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I got hit,” Zhu Yunbai snorted in disdain, then raised his eyebrows. “He’s going to graduate soon, but he still has that ruffian temper. He’ll only be able to work in that rice shop with his parents for his entire life.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Jing smiled. </span><i><span style>It seems like the target I chose is pretty good.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Right now, Zhu Yunbai already has problems with his roommates, so it seems like I can accomplish the mission that person set me very soon.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Your roommates did it, right?” Guo Jing moved her lips over, and licked the bruised spot. The stimulation ran through Zhu Yunbai’s body… “Ignore them. Just let those annoying people do as they like. If you are really angry, then I can help you get rid of them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Clap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhu Yunbai lifted his hand and covered Guo Jing’s mouth. At that moment, Zhu Yunbai was no longer in the mood to listen to her, he was already completely turned on by the woman…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t… someone’s here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you scared for? Who would dare to say anything?” Zhu Yunbai smirked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, Guo Jing also laid back her carseat semi-reluctantly as she rolled up the car windows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two of them proceeded to entwine together, but Zhu Yunbai did not notice that…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Jing’s eyes begun to turn a purplish red as she passed a purple seed from her mouth into his.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>After staying in the dorm for a bit longer, Ye Zichen went over to the teahouse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiang-jie continued to act as the receptionist on the first floor with a smile. When Ye Zichen ran up to the third floor, he saw Wei Chen dressed in a pair of black leather jacket and trousers, while the other people were getting ready hurriedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Abyssals appeared. I’m taking these little fellows to get a feel for things,” Wei Chen smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately raised his eyebrows. “I’m coming with you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Ye, did you forgot what I said back then?” Wei Chen suddenly squinted his eyes, then patted Ye Zichen’s shoulder and said to the Tribulation members on the third floor. “All ready? Let’s get going.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen went downstairs with them. After watching them leave, Xiang-jie, who sat on the first floor, smiled, “The Abyssals are appearing more and more frequently. This is the third time Manager Wei has taken the team out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that so?” Ye Zichen nodded, while he knitted his eyebrows and pondered about the origin of the Abyssals.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Right now, there are still few Abyssals that were corrupted from humans, they are mostly beasts... But, I feel like that guy is getting ready to corrupt masses of humans.” Xiang-jie smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Ye Zichen instantly raised his eyebrows, “Xiang-jie, do you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t…” Xiang-jie immediately raised her hand to stop Ye Zichen from continuing. “I don’t know anything, but I feel like you will find that person very quickly. Be more observant, and pay attention to the people around you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, several customers arrived outside the teahouse. Thus, Ye Zichen also nodded and returned to the third floor.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>People around me…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is Xiang-jie giving me a hint and telling me that the person that’s creating abyssals is by my side? Or perhaps, if I was to think on a slightly wider scale, that person might be rather near me.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Where am I supposed to go and find him!?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bingcheng’s huge? It’s not like I have the various fortune-telling techniques the hidden families have, which would allow me to find stuff out.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sighed silently, and noticed that there was a red “1” on the WeChat app.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He clicked it open…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ox Demon King has sent a friend request.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Original Chapter Teaser:</b>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p><i>At the teahouse...</i></p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>What happened?</p>
 <p><strong>Wei Chen:&nbsp;</strong>Abyssal appeared again, I'm going out with these guys to take care of them.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Wait a mo', I'm coming.</p>
 <p><strong>Wei Chen:&nbsp;</strong>No you're not.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Huh?</p>
 <p><strong>Wei Chen:&nbsp;</strong>Remember your job.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Yeah, find out who's behind all this. But honestly? I haven't gotten anywhere. I might be able to notice something if I come with you.</p>
 <p><strong>Wei Chen:&nbsp;</strong>But you're just going to get endangered. It's better if you stay and continue to search for clues. We are still able to take care of everything.</p>
