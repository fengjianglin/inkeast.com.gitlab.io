 <p><span style>Chapter 434 – Your Highness</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Stop kidding me!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was completely stunned the moment he entered the Otherworld. What he saw was countless low-leveled slimy reptilian abyssals, and giant abyssals covering everything.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just what exactly happened? It has only been half a month. Why did the number of abyssals increase to such a level?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Haven’t Wei Chen and the rest of them been restoring the barrier and hunting the abyssals!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Low leveled slimy reptilian monsters continuously bit at the barrier between the Modern Realm and the Otherworld, and what caught people’s attention was that the huge abyssals had already begun to carry weapons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bone clubs, blades… What’s more, the huge abyssals moved in a very organized manner, as if they were supervising the low-leveled slimy abyssals’ work.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did they actually develop to this degree? Just what have you guys been doing!?” Taibai Jinxing frowned tensely. At that moment, his expression was beyond dark. He quickly clenched his fist tightly, and muttered. “The Jade Emperor didn’t listen to me and send his army. If this continues, then the Modern Realm would eventually fall… Then, after that, the Three Realms will be troubled!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Roar…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, one of the huge demons roared. It was as if they had already noticed Taibai and Ye Zichen. Then, not long later, an abyssal holding a bone club walked over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who… are… you!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the abyssal did not speak very smoothly, but it did say a complete sentence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Ye Zichen was truly shocked.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Supervising and speaking!?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>They truly evolved in such a short time like Xiang-jie said. Do they actually possess intelligence?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Kid, we can’t waste anymore time. The abyssal in front of us is already going to turn into a high-class abyssal soon. His strength should be between an early-stage Human Immortal, or… Kill them, or, retreat…” It was very hard to imagine Taibai Jinxing, who had a vendetta against the demons, would actually speak about abyssals like that. There were so many of them that Ye Zichen felt pressured as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How are we supposed to retreat when we’re in this sort of situation!” Ye Zichen squinted his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the huge abyssal also spoke up once again, “Don’t disturb us. Leave… Or die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go!’ Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows, as a ray of golden light appeared in his hand, which he swung towards the abyssal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The abyssal’s chest was instantly pierced, causing it to fall limply onto the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A spiritual formation also appeared underneath Taibai’s feet. Judging from the ancient characters on the spiritual formation, Taibai was standing on the place of fire…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Incinerate!” He said softly. Not long later, balls of heavenly fire fell from the sky and incinerated all of the low level abyssals.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Roar…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since the two of them merely launched a surprise attack, all of the other abyssals all looked around at them when Taibai Jinxing and Ye Zichen dealt with all of the giant abyssals and low level abyssals.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unknown sounds rang out from the huge abyssals’ mouths, causing the low leveled reptilian abyssals to immediately turn around and crawl towards Ye Zicen and Taibai Jinxing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They rushed over like a frightened beast swarm, while the footsteps of the huge abyssals behind them also sounded out loudly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yiyuan!” In that situation, Ye Zichen felt like he could only use Soul Pearl Yiyuan’s area based attack, but he completely forgot that Yiyuan did not follow him over to the Otherworld.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had called Yiyuan’s name before, but there was no response.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Intruder,” the giant demon shouted out darkly, then swung its rusty sword towards Ye Zichen without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Move!” Taibai Jinxing pushed Ye Zichen to the side, and after Ye Zichen left the attacking radius, the spiritual formation underneath Taibai Jinxing’s feet changed. Fire… instantly turned metallic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Break!” A white beard fluttered in the air as Taibai Jinxing chopped the huge demon’s blade with his own hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The blade was instantly split in half. Then, the formation underneath Taibai Jinxing instantly returned to the fire position, causing balls of terrifying heavenly fire to fall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, nobody expected that the huge abyssal actually suddenly realized the place Taibai Jinxing wanted to attack…</span></p>
 <p><span style>A protective barrier instantly formed around it, blocking off the heavenly fire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haa…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the slimy reptilian monsters continuously moved forward, Taibai Jinxing’s eyebrows knitted closely together. He glanced at the huge abyssal, then turned to Ye Zichen, “Can you fly? If we continue fighting like this, then even those low level abyssals will bite us to death.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoosh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A pair of wings immediately appeared behind Ye Zichen’s back. Taibai Jinxing’s expression instantly changed when he saw the pair of wings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t think too much into it. I’m not someone of the demon race. We’ll talk about why I have this pair of wings after we deal with them!” Ye Zichen squinted his eyes and replied. </span><i><span style>The abyssals are truly evolving too quickly. They actually gained basic intelligence in half a month and those gigantic abyssals are actually able to use defensive spiritual techniques.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>If we just let them grow let this, then god knows if they’ll evolve into real demons.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, the moment Ye Zichen spread out his wings, the gigantic abyssals, who were attacking them, actually all stopped, while the crawling slimy monsters also stopped in their tracks due to the scolding of the gigantic abyssals.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s going on?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing and Ye Zichen looked towards each other. Not long later, fifty meters tall abyssal with a skeletal club walked over and kneeled down on one knee, then placed its right hand across its chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Demonic Highness. We actually did not realize it was you who descended here. Please forgive our disrespectful actions!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other gigantic abyssals also kneeled down, while the low level abyssals all exhaled purple gas without moving.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was stunned. </span><i><span style>These gigantic demons actually called me ‘Your Highness’, it seems like they actually think that I’m a demon.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t deny it,” At that moment, Taibai Jinxing suddenly flew over and whispered in his ear. “As long as abyssals don’t evolve into demons, their intelligence is still limited. Since they think that you’re a lord from the demon race, then let them continue with that mistake… I’m not confident if we have to actually fight them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded. He naturally understood all that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He flapped his wings and flew several meters forward. The moment he flapped his wings, the gigantic abyssals lowered their heads even further, as if they were terrified…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn’t think that you actually recognized me!” Ye Zichen said plainly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The gigantic abyssal in the lead immediately looked up, “I wonder what is Your Highness doing here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, I just came to see whether you guys were focused on working or not,” Ye Zichen snorted coldly with squinted eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The abyssals on the ground quickly shook their heads, “Your Highness, we have been working hard the entire time!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why don’t I believe you? You guys actually wanted to attack me just now. I think that you guys want to rebel, right? Do you think that those of us of the demon race have been too strict on you…” Ye Zichen snorted, then his gaze turned ice cold. “So you wanted to rebel!?”</span></p>
