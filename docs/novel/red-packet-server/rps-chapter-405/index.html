 <p><span style>Chapter 405 – Open Ended Side Mission</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was not even the slightest bit surprised when he saw the friend request.</span></p>
 <p><span style>According to his understanding of the system, after getting a mission item like the “Ox Demon King’s Love Letter”, a side mission will definitely get triggered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen accepted the friend request without any hesitation, and habitually glanced at the intimacy level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>100. Friendly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little buddy, this is the first time we’ve talked!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Ox Demon King immediately sent him a message after accepting the friend request.</span></p>
 <p><span style>According to Ye Zichen’s predictions, his second sentence should be…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahem, you seem to have a treasure of mine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled. </span><i><span style>As I expected, the Ox Demon King added me for the love letter. Judging from my many years of experience in gaming, this sort of side mission would definitely give me choices.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>For example, I could give the love letter to the Ox Demon King to gain his affability and some benefits; or, I could also give it to Princess Iron Face.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>That sounds fun.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Is Ox Demon King talking about that love letter?” Ye Zichen typed out his response with a faint smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Ox Demon King immediately replied, “Yes, yes, yes. Little bro, can you return that love letter to big brother?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Return…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I naturally have to do so.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had no use for the item. He wasn’t someone with a strange interest, and liked to collect these weird things.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he had to understand something first.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How did you know that this love letter is in my hands, and actually took the initiative in finding me and sending me a friend request?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen replied with squinted eyes. He was slightly confused when it happened with Literari Star, and when it happened with Princess Iron Fan, he was completely stunned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, he felt like there was definitely someone controlling it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uhm… When I woke up just now, a master had passed me a message with their consciousness, telling me to go and seek you out. To be honest, I’m a bit confused right now, but I feel like that master wouldn’t go out of his way to trick me.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I knew it!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately thought of the system, who talked with him until very late the previous night, </span><i><span style>it might have been this brat who told Ox Demon King to come and find me.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Mission Issued (Open Ended).</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <ol>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><span style> Return the Ox Demon King’s love letter back to him.</span></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><span style> Refuse the Ox Demon King’s request, and give the love letter to Princess Iron Fan.</span></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><span style> Threaten the Jade Faced Vixen with the love letter.</span></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ol>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Please choose…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This system is getting more and more high tech. There is no doubt that there will be huge changes whichever one of the three choices I choose.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Giving the love letter to Princess Iron Fan was clearly destroying the relationship of the couple, what’s more, the Ox Demon King will become hostile towards me, so I can’t choose it.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>As for the Jade Faced Vixen, she someone who just acts as a mistress, so what use was threatening her? Was I supposed to make her sleep with me? It’s pretty obvious that this choice is useless as well.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen thought about it for a moment, then clicked on option 1.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Are you sure?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right after confirming his choice, Ye Zichen’s phone uncontrollably sent the love letter over as a red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ox Demon King received your red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little bro, thank you so much!” The Ox Demon King’s words of thanks filled the screen after he received the red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen didn’t really care about that, what he cared about was…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Where are the red packets!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I already sent the love letter over, so you should give me a red packet, right?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your intimacy level with the Ox Demon King increased by 100.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Intimacy level leveled up. Current intimacy level: Trusted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You gained the Ox Demon King’s goodwill. Reputation increased by 100.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It seems like this is all the benefits I get from returning the love letter? That’s too low! It’s all some useless stuff, at the very least, it should give me some useful skills or something.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Otherwise, even a bit of cultivation experience was fine.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Little bro, if you are in any trouble in the future, tell Big Brother Ox. Big Brother Ox will definitely do whatever I can for you… Big Brother still has a bit of other stuff to do, so let’s stop chatting!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoosh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ox Demon King’s profile picture darkened.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What a trap.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>The side mission as completed with those words?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Buzz…</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Ye Zichen couldn’t help but retort, Su Yiyun suddenly called him. He answered the phone, and heard Su Yiyun’s bright laughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a simple conversation, Ye Zichen turned around and left the teahouse, then hurried towards the place Su Yiyun talked about.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At Glory hotel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen arrived in the room Su Yiyun mentioned, he saw that the room was filled with people the moment he pulled open the door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He barely knew any of them. The only ones he knew were Su Yan and Su Yiyun, alongside LI Min’e, who he had met once before. As for the rest…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the hell?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>For some reason, Ye Zichen felt extremely uncomfortably due to those people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi, you came so late,” Su Yiyun stood up from his chair and walked over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately said quietly, “What’s going on? I don’t know any of these people!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha, actually, I don’t know them either,” Su Yiyun whispered in Ye Zichen’s ear. “Today is Min’e’s birthday, so the ones who came are all her friends… Su Yan and I felt a bit awkward as well, so we called you over. At least there is something to talk about with the three of us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh,” Ye Zichen nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun laughed, then clapped, “Everyone, be quiet for a moment. Let me introduce to you guys. Ye Zichen, my brother, he’s the owner behind the scenes for Maintaining Beauty Corporation and a true rich first generation!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unexpectedly, none of them felt revealed any changes in expression after hearing that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as if they don’t know what Maintaining Beauty does at all!</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, Su YIyun’s expression stiffened slightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Ye is here. Take a seat. This girl is truly honored for being able to invite you to the birthday party!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded, then sat down beside Su Yan. Only then did he start to observe the people around the table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were eleven in total, both male and female, young and old…</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was very hard to imagine a cute girl like Li Min’e actually had such a huge social circle. What’s more, Ye Zichen was able to feel a faint aura from them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was especially true for the woman with thick makeup sitting opposite him. If he was not getting it wrong…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then the girl seemed to be seducing him. What’s more, he also couldn’t help but keep looking at her, while starting to feel like he was falling in love.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, a spot on his waist begun to hurt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen turned around, and saw Su Yan sitting beside him with a calm expression, but the hand she had used to pinch him earlier was still on his waist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, jealous?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan did not reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows, then whispered into Su Yan’s ear, “I’m telling you, I looked at the woman for so long just now, but I didn’t notice where she’s better than you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe…” At that moment, the woman sitting opposite Ye Zichen smiled. Mr. Ye, saying bad things behind people’s back is going to get you punished.”</span></p>

 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Hey, what is it?</p>
 <p><strong>Ox Demon King:&nbsp;</strong>Gah, I'm no good at speaking in circles, so I'll get straight to it. You have something I want.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Are you perhaps talking about the love letter?</p>
 <p><strong>Ox Demon King:&nbsp;</strong>Ahh, good. So you do know what I was talking about, It really saved me a lot of time and effort. So, can you please return it to me?</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Can you answer a question first?</p>
