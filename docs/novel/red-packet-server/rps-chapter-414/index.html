 <p><span style>Chapter 414 – The Demon Race’s Formation Grandmaster</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This is a lie!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rubbed his eyes with force. </span><i><span style>I must be seeing things. Otherwise, how could he be here?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The young man who descended slowly had black hair that fell to his shoulders, while the symbol of a ball of fire appeared in the middle of his eyebrows as well as the back of the long black robe he wore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His dark eyes were calm as he smirked…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big… Big Brother!” Su Yan muttered in shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man also walked beside Gu Li and waved towards Ye Zichen and co. with a smile, “What a coincidence.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hey…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>This is impossible, right!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had already endured too much that night. He could not believe that the man in front of him was really Su Yiyun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? You don’t recognize me? Ye-zi, we’re good bros!” Su Yiyun smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that familiar manner of addressing him, Ye Zichen instantly clenched his fist and roared in anger, “Ol’ Three, why… Can you tell me just what happened!?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This is just a dream, right!?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>A nightmare which I did not wake up from.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Out of us six in the dorm, four died. Only Su Yiyun and I remained. He… actually sided with the demons?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>You’re kidding me.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s eyes were filled with blatant franticness. At the same time, Su Yan also walked forward with knitted eyebrows and asked in confusion, “Ge, you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You still want to call me Big Brother now?” Su Yiyun curled his lips, while his eyes were filled with mockery as he snorted. “You call me big brother, but I don’t remember a little sister like you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ge!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan walked forward and reached out in an attempt to drag Su Yiyun back, but…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun mercilessly slapped her. He knitted his eyebrows and pointed at the fire symbol in between them and snorted, “Don’t call me ge. Laozi is now the demon race’s formation grandmaster. Who the f*ck is your ge…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ol’ Three!” Ye Zichen charged over with bloodshot eyes, but before he got anywhere close, he felt a barrier completely trapping him within.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He knocked on the barrier, while confusion filled his eyes…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ol’ Three, can you wake up? Ol’ Three…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun picked his ear, then blew at his finger towards Ye Zichen. Then, he scratched his head impatiently with knitted eyebrows, “Ol’ Three, Ol’ Three. Can you stop addressing me so intimately? Do you want to use your relationship with me? Seriously…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ever since Su Yiyun appeared, Fatty Yin did not make a single move. That was because Su Yiyun had already set down restraints around Fatty Yin, so it was extremely difficult for him to even move a single finger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ge!” Su Yan also yelled with tears covering her face. “Ge, stop messing around, they’re all bad people.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Seriously, so annoying!” A thunderous sigil suddenly appeared at Su Yiyun’s fingertip. He pointed towards Su Yan, causing the powers of the sigil to be casted upon her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Electricity surged through Su Yan’s body. Since she was merely a normal person, she was unable to endure all that as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, she fainted and fell onto the ground in mere moments.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Su Yan!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who was trapped within the spiritual formation kicked the barrier and shouted towards Su Yiyun with bloodshot eyes, “Su Yiyun, have you gone crazy!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I already told her not to call me big brother. She didn’t listen… So annoying!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He mercilessly kicked Su Yan out ten-odd meters. At the same time, twelve figures also appeared by his side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were the people from Li Min’e’s birthday party. Li Min’e walked beside Su Yiyun and kissed his cheek…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ve been troubled!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How is it trouble? I can do anything for my babe,” Su Yiyun smiled softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The elder standing amongst them also spoke up, “Since it’s pretty much done here, then let’s clean up and return. I’ve sure Lord Black Dragon will be very happy about you, Formation Grandmaster.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, she walked towards Ye Zichen. However, he hit an invisible wall before even taking a few steps.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lord Su…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who told you to make a move on him?” Su Yiyun raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The elder immediately replied, “The reincarnation of the Yellow Emperor has always been the demon race’s mission target. This young man might…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You said might!” Su Yiyun said sullenly. “This is my good bro. I don’t want you to make a move on him, understand? Even if we have to, it will be done by laozi personally.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Su…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My patience is limited,” Su Yiyun’s gaze turned beyond dark, while he formed a sigil in his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, the elder immediately stepped back without daring to say anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I came with you guys this time to save this brat,” Su Yiyun grabbed Gu Li’s shoulder, then looked at everyone else with a condescending gaze, “Mission accomplished, so stop causing trouble. I… don’t have a particularly good temper.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone he set his gaze upon looked down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In order to prevent awkwardness from spreading, Li Min’e wrapped her arms around Su Yiyun’s arm with a giggle, “Alright, stop getting angry with them. We’ll just not take that person away, since we haven’t confirmed whether he is the Yellow Emperor’s reincarnation after all. Alright, alright, don’t get angry!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh,” Su Yiyun laughed coldly, then slowly walked in front of Ye Zichen and patted his cheek… “My good bro, you have to work hard… Next time, I’ll take your life myself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ol’ Three, stop messing around. Did you forget about our dorm…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What dorm? Now? Does it still exist?” Su Yiyun smiled meaningfully, then glanced at Zhu Yunbai’s corpse before turning around and laughing darkly. “2016… has disbanded!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun stretched lazily, then walked in front of Su Yan and squatted in front of her with a shake of his head and a chuckle, “When I remember you calling me gege for so many years, I just can’t help but get angrily.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He punched her on the stomach, then poked her many times…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop calling me gege. It’s annoying.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After doing all that, he finally let out a sigh and walked in front of Li Min’e. He reached out and wrapped his arm around her waist with a smile, “Alright babe, let’s go to the Demon Realm… I’m very curious about that place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoosh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of them disappeared from the spatial crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moments after Su Yiyun and co. left, the spiritual formation around Ye Zichen and Fatty Yin also disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll go and check up on them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Fatty Yin immediately flew towards the battlefield, while Ye Zichen also hurried over to Su Yan…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Creak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clenched his teeth so hard that he nearly broke his teeth when he saw Su Yan’s situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her face was already stark white, her body was filled with terrifying bloody holes, while blood continuously flowed out of her mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Su Yiyun… Su Yiyun…”</span></p>
 <p></p>

 <p></p>
 <p><i>This is a lie!</i></p>
 <p>Those were the words Ye Zichen first thought of when he saw the person who had arrived. Out of everyone, who could have caused his to have such a huge reaction?</p>
 <p>And what is the significance behind the person siding with the demons? Was it for glory? Fame? Ambition? Or was it something deeper than that?</p>
 <p>The wheel of destiny has already been set in motion, and everyone has a part to play. However, are the parts they are playing just as they seem? Or is there more to what Ye Zichen sees on the surface?</p>
 <p>Now, an acquaintance of his has appeared in front of him with dominating might. How will Ye Zichen prevail?</p>
