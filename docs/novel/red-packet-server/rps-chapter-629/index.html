 <p><span style>Chapter 629 – God</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen did not care about Wenchang Monarch’s rage in the least bit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Instead, he was feeling rather good about himself when he saw the official notice in the group and the plethora of comments below it.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Having power sure is great. I can deal with whoever I don’t like.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen ignored the mourning for Wenchang Monarch in the group and returned his phone to his pocket, then rested his gaze upon the divine stones in the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sis, if I make a wish now, do you really think it’ll come true?” Zuo Liang blinked as he asked Zuo Mo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How would I know? How about trying it out? But don’t make that sort of wish that’s just asking for a beating, got it?” Zuo Mo waved her fist in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I promise I won’t do that anymore,” Zuo Liang promised, then closed his eyes and prayed. “I want a glass of water.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoosh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immediately afterward, a cup of cold water randomly dropped down from the sky. Zuo Liang caught the cup with wide eyes, then looked at the divine stones below him in surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Get me another glass of water.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoosh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Another glass of water appeared in the room out of nowhere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sis!” Zuo Liang’s eyes were filled with shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Mo looked at the two cups of water in her little brother’s hands, then bit her lips, “I want it to rain outside.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rumble.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The currently clear skies were instantly covered with rain clouds. The sudden change caused everyone who didn’t know what had caused it to be completely shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen was even more shocked than the rest.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s going on? I thought the wishes that have been granted were all coincidences?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But it doesn’t seem like Zuo Mo’s and Zuo Liang’s wishes being fulfilled was a coincidence. Zuo Liang’s two cups of water literally came out of nowhere!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“My god!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Liang couldn’t help but exclaim. He repeatedly gulped as he looked at the divine stones on the floor then back at Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Ye, where did you get some divine items like this!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen scratched his head and squatted with them in front of the divine stones. He looked at the stones in confusion. </span><i><span style>Could these divine stones really have the ability to grant wishes?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But why didn’t my wish of getting the Heavenly Sacred Emperor Equaling Heaven adding me to his contact list come true?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, he had an idea. He clasped his hands together, closed his eyes, and prayed silently.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I want Xiao Yumei to return to my side from the Demon Realm.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Is there something wrong with you!?” An angry shout rang through the room. “Do you guys think that I’m just a donkey? You want this, you want that, you want… Ugh. Are you trying to work me to death!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The three people looked up in the room and saw an Arabian-looking man sitting cross-legged in the air. There was a piece of white cloth, which wrapped around his head, while his what was essentially a unibrow was bent in a frown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Mo, Zuo Liang and Ye Zichen all looked at each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows, “Are you the genie of the lamp?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What genie!? I am God!” The unibrow man floated in the air and answered cockily. “The supreme and almighty God!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“God…” Ye Zichen muttered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, I am God,” the man repeated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh, if you’re God, then why did you come to the Immortal Region? Shouldn’t you be up there?” Ye Zichen questioned as he pointed upwards to the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahem,” the unibrow man’s expression changed. “I descended to have a look. Do you have a problem with that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen noticed his gaze on the seven divine stones when he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled, then couldn’t help but ask, “Nope. You are the almighty god, how could we mortals have an issue with what you’re doing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh,” the unibrow man laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen also asked once again, “Great God, I wonder how we should address you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wish!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh Great Wish God,” Ye Zichen cupped his hands and smiled extremely respectfully. “ Great Wish God, your divine authority seems to be able to grant the wishes of the masses, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was clear what Ye Zichen wanted to express. Since he could grant the wishes of the masses, then why did the god stop when it come to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m tired,” with that, the unibrow man went back into the seven divine stones. “Don’t make any wishes in the near future. I need to rest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great Wish God, please wait!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his hand to stop the man before he could enter, then asked nervously, “You are an almighty god, it’s fine if you don’t fulfill my wish, but can you tell me how is she?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you think I’m an encyclopedia and know everything!?” the unibrow man frowned, then shook his head with a soft sigh. “She’s fine, and will be fine in the future. She is fated to aided by someone in the future.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And that person is…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can’t say anything about that,” with that, the man entered the divine stones. At the same time, the once shimmering stones dimmed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although that wasn’t what he initially wanted, Ye Zichen did stop worrying after getting the god’s confirmation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But then, he suddenly remembered that he still had another question unanswered.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hanba!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Great god, don’t rest yet, I still have another question I want to ask! Great god, great god…” Ye Zichen shouted at the divine stones, but the stones did not react at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s definitely resting. Look, the stones aren’t shining anymore,” Zuo Mo said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shouted a few more times, but when he saw that there really wasn’t any reaction, he let out a long sigh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can’t believe that there was a god in the stones." Zuo Liang blinked, then looked at the divine stones which were now no different from normal rocks, then at the cups he was still holding in his hand.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I actually used up two wishes for two cups of water. Ugh, what am I doing.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Who was the person you were asking about just now?” Zuo Mo bit her lips and asked as if it was just a casual question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tiantian ran over with a giggle. “It’s Mommy, I just wished that Mommy would be safe just now and that she would finish her work quicker to come home to see me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, a hint of disappointment surfaced on Tiantian’s face, “Tiantian hasn’t seen Mommy in so long, Tiantian misses her so much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The simple comment caused Ye Zichen to feel sad. He held Tiantian tightly in his arms, “Mommy will be back very quickly. Tiantian’s a good girl.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course Tiantian will be a good girl, Tiantian’s all grown up already,” Tiantian nodded sensibly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen held her for a while longer before he put her down, and sat down while he rubbed his temple with his right hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although he now knows that Xiao Yumei would be fine, he was still a bit worried.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zuo Mo, can you arrange a room for me? I’m a bit tired, so I want to rest,” Ye Zichen continuously rubbed his temples.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing his suffering look, Zuo Mo held back the question she was just about to ask.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have already prepared one for you. Lil’ Liang and I will take you there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, thank you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the three people left the room together, they seemed to have forgotten that the divine stones were still on the floor of the room. Not long after they left, a figure appeared in the meeting halls.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Divine stones which can grant wishes. Hehe…”</span></p>
 <p></p>
