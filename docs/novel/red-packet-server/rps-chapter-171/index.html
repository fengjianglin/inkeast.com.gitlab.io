 <p><span style>Chapter 171 – Mon-Monkey!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Burp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Great Sage, who was sitting on the ground, slowly stood up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He reached out and grabbed Ye Zichen’s shoulder, then shook his head, “No, bro, I, Old Sun, can’t eat anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How can that be okay? There is still a whole storeroom of goods waiting to be eaten by the Great Sage. How can you be stuffed just like this?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows playfully, then pressed the Great Sage down to the floor before handing him a piece of bread. “Eat! Eat more! Didn’t you leave a clone here in secret in order to eat all you wanted? I’m giving you the chance already, why are you already saying that you can’t eat anymore…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was beyond speechless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Blackie found him, and asked him to go back to the supermarket, he saw the Great Sage eating happily in the basement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Zhuge Kongming was suspended in midair. From what Blackie said, it seemed like Blackie was beaten up the few times he wanted to run out and tell on him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it wasn’t because the Great Sage started to eat in the basement, Blackie might not have even been able to inform Ye Zichen at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the Great Sage saw Ye Zichen arrive, he immediately acted as if he wasn’t afraid of anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, Ye Zichen wasn’t angry about what he had done.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>If he wanted to eat, then let him eat his fill!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Burp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Great Sage, who was half lying on the floor, burped once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The mountains of empty snack packets and bottles were the war achievements.</span></p>
 <p><span style>More importantly, those were but a small part of it all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen and Zhuge Kongming had already taken the rest out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, I, Old Sun, truly can’t eat anymore. I, Old Sun, know my wrongs, and will not steal food in the future ever again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Burp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Great Sage continuously burped with his large belly, and continuously waved his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t merely the fact that he couldn’t eat anymore!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He felt a little disgusted by eating.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You know your wrongs?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Great Sage immediately nodded, “Yes, I truly know my wrongs. I, Old Sun, will definitely not steal food from now on.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then clean up,” Ye Zichen sat down on a chair and crossed his legs like a big boss.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Great Sage grabbed a handful of hair from behind his neck, and blew, causing a room full of monkeys to appear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was also stunned when he saw this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a scene he had only seen on television before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With the Great Sage Monkey Sun’s aides, the entire supermarket became beyond clean.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only issue was…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The shelves were all empty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro!” The Great Sage burped as he walked over, causing the air to faintly smell of coke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To be honest, Ye Zichen got mad the moment he saw the Great Sage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Great Sage could’ve just told him if he wanted to eat. Yet, he left a clone here to steal food. If it wasn’t for Blackie running out to tell him, Zhuge Kongming might have died of hunger as he was suspended in the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So nice, I, Old Sun, ate my full,” The Great Sage smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your intimacy level with the Monkey King increased by 200. Current intimacy level: 425.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If anyone dares to… Burp… bully you in the Heavenly Court… Burp… I, Old Sun definitely… Burp… Definitely… Burp…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Great Sage took a long time and did not manage to say anything in the end, causing Ye Zichen to rolled his eyes speechlessly and hand him a bottle of coke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it was before, the Great Sage would definitely yell and snatch the bottle of coke over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, this time…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Great Sage shook his hands extremely resolutely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t, don’t, don’t. I, Old Sun… Burp… am not drinking anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen got the Great Sage to do some exercise after his meal, then took out his phone to glance at the Heavenly Court’s chat group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The same deities continued to chat in the group. However, what was different from before was that…</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were gossiping in the group!</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were talking about the ways to gain cultivation experience!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Some deities laughed wryly and said that the number of worshippers in the mortal realm dropped drastically, causing them to be unable to quickly withdraw a lot, while some great deities retorted that Yue Lao was selling the stuff too expensively in the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That geezer really succeeded in the Heavenly Court.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Doesn’t that mean…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Everyone held a Nutri-Express in their hands, while holding spicy gluten in their mouths!?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>This was definitely a moving scene.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>After lurking in the group for a while and seeing that no red packets appeared, Ye Zichen left the group and sought out King Chujiang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“King Chujiang, how is the retrieval of the Fragment of Soul Pearl Yiyuan!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen asked him for so long already, yet this guy completely ignored him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within one of the halls in the Underworld.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The phone of King Chujiang, who was listening to a song, rang, causing him to look at it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk, mere mortal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ever since Ye Zichen saved King Qinguang, King Chujiang ignored the White Impermanence and got Ox-head and Horse-face to investigate in the mortal realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The result that got was that…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was truly a mortal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although his identity was unknown, as one of the King Yama Kings, there was no way he could look at a mere mortal properly.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ignore.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He swiped the notification to the right.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it wasn’t because Ye Zichen had a bit of relationship with Erlang Shen, who was in the Heavenly Court, King Chujiang might have deleted his contact information.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck, what’s with that grandson?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen squinted his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Something wasn’t right!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>From how King Chujiang and King Qinguang appeared the other day, they should instantly reply when he sent them a message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great Sage.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I, Old Sun, is here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Great Sage was truly stuffed, causing him to continuously walk in circles within the supermarket.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Help me with something.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, say it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Great Sage did feel a bit bad for eating so many of Ye Zichen’s treasures, so he was naturally happy to be of any kind of help.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A while ago, King Chujiang promised to give me the Fragment of Soul Pearl Yiyuan in the Underworld to me. However, he has just ignored me ever since that time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I, Old Sun, know that you need the Soul Pearl Yiyuan, but the Underworld only has one fragment!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have five fragments with me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen withdrew the five fragments of Soul Pearl Yiyuan that he had.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fragments showed five different colors and were beyond sparkling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-dage, what’s this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhuge Kongming also ran over with open eyes. Speaking of him, it was rather weird that this little fellow was the same as Xia Keke, he wasn’t surprised that the Great Sage appeared in the Modern World, at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From his perspective, it seemed like everything was natural.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is a celestial item, understand?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhuge Kongming shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, the Great Sage also revealed an expression of surprise, “Bro, you actually have five fragments of Soul Pearl Yiyuan, your luck is beyond good…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soul Pearl Yiyuan was an ancient magical item.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Great deities from the Heavenly Court have searched for it intentionally before, but regardless of who it was, they never succeeded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Great Sage gave Ye Zichen a thumbs up and took out his phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen felt extreme pity for the Great Sage when he saw the crappy phone, so he made a silent determination to get a new one for the Great Sage later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“King Chujiang of the Underworld, right? I, Old Sun, will have a chat with him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, the Great Sage found King Chujiang from his contact list…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey! You there? Hurry up and reply to me, Old Sun.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang’s phone within the hall rang again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that mortal done yet!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang cursed and picked up the phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he saw the flickering display image…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang, who was sitting on the royal chair, suddenly slipped onto the floor with an expression of fright, causing the surrounding attendant girls to quickly help him up…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mon-Mon-Monkey!”</span></p>
