 <p><span style>Chapter 86 – The Ugly Daughter-in-Law is going to meet the Mother-in-Law</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan wrapped her arms around Ye Zichen’s arm as they walked along the street.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan couldn’t help but ask as she looked at the look of the man, who seemed to be lost in thoughts, “What is it? Are you facing some trouble?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Trouble.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen did have one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ever since he had the thought of opening a supermarket, he begun to think about what was the best way to do it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He kept on thinking about finding a chance to open a supermarket.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The size didn’t have to be too big, but the storage must be huge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were so many deities in the Heavenly Court, if the business expands in the future, he definitely needed a large stock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Su Yan, I want to open a supermarket. Do you think that’s a good idea?” Ye Zichen thought about it, then decided to ask Su Yan for her thoughts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan was stunned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen saw her confused expression, she smiled, “Never mind, pretend that I didn’t say anything.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t think too much into it, I just didn’t’ react. Why did you suddenly think about opening a supermarket?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s just an initial thought, I might not actually open it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, oh, then alright. I will support you no matter what you do,” Su Yan leaned on Ye Zichen’s shoulder with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, at that moment, the Ye Zichen’s phone rang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yumei,” Ye Zichen picked up the call with a smile, while Su Yan frowned.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Yumei.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>A woman!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, I’ll be right there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen quickly hung up, then saw that Su Yan, who was beside him, was like a furious lion cub as she glared at him with a frown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Su Yan, I have some business, so I have to leave for a moment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“To see that Yumei!?” Su Yan’s tone was very strange.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded with a coy smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Playboy,” Su Yan frowned, then let go of his arm with an angry snort.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry up and go, but I am the legal wife! Do you understand! Also, you’re coming with me to that high school reunion.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within Yumei Jewelers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty Bai sat on the chair opposite Xiao Yumei. There was a contract of shares transfer in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yumei,” Ye Zichen pushed opened the office door and walked in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she saw him, Xiao Yumei’s eyes brightened, while she blushed, “Zichen, Director Bai finally drafted up the contract for the transfer of shares.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei pointed towards the contract on the table and frowned. Then he walked beside Fatty Bai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty Bai quickly stood up from the chair and forced out a smile, “Young Master Ye.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The contract on the table was indeed a register of share transfer, transferring fifty one percent of Dafa Jewelers without any other conditions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at that contract, then sat onto the sofa in the office with a light smile, “Director Bai, you really put a lot into this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Ye, what are you saying! You have a large amount of ores, Director Xiao used these ores to expand her business by several times in such a short period of time. This is something everyone in the circle witnessed. I truly got the advantage by giving half of the shares to follow Young Master Ye.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Director Bai smiled like a grandson, causing several layers of folds to appear on the fat on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Ye Zichen’s eyes shimmered as he said playfully, “Really? Director Bai got the advantage? That’s no good, I don’t like to be taken advantage of, how about Director Bai giving me a bit more shares?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty Bai’s expression instantly darkened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it wasn’t because he was threatened, he wouldn’t even be willing to hand over this fifty one percent of the shares.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a business that he had established with a lot of effort.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled meaningfully when he saw Fatty Bai’s sullen expression, then stood up from the sofa.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m just kidding. Director Bai, don’t be so nervous,” he patted Fatty Bai’s shoulders and pointed onto the contract on the table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Both lawyers are here. If there are no other issues, then sign it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, sure.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Director Bai picked up a pen to sign his name onto the contract, then pushed it in front of Xiao Yumei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Xiao Yumei was about to sign, Ye Zichen stopped her with a chuckle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll sign it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before anyone else reacted, Ye Zichen directly signed his name onto the contract.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty Bai’s expression istantly turned terrible, causing Ye Zichen to put on an expression of confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Director Bai, what happened? Are you unwell? That’s no good, you are a major shareholder in my jewelry shop in the future, your health is very important.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you for Young Master Ye’s care. I’m fine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s good. Alright, we signed the contract, so you can leave now, Director Bai. I’ll go to my jewelry shop to survey the work in a few days.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Bai Dahai left the office with a dark look, Xiao Yumei asked in confusion, “Zichen, why did you sign the contract just now? Didn’t you say to combine his jewelry shop with mine?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s something up with this fatty. No matter what, this jewelry store is his life’s work. It’s too weird for him to just give it to people when mentioned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So it’s like this…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei nodded understandingly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, Ye Zichen approached her as he licked his lips, “Mei-jie…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen wrapped his arm around Xiao Yumei’s waist and put her onto the office table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No-Not here…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei’s face instantly turned incomparably red as she used her white hands to push Ye Zichen’s shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry, they don’t dare to enter.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen’s lowered his mouth without any hestitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, the room was filled with a lewd scene.</span></p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p><span style>“Daddy, Mommy, where are we going?” Tiantian said childishly as she laid in Ye Zichen’s arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’re going to stay at Daddy’s home.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen caressed Tiantian’s hair. Xiao Yumei and Ye Zichen had discussed it the previous day that they will get Tiantian to stay here for her safety.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei, who was driving, had her face full of a nervous red. She was about to see her mother-in-law very soon, who knows what her mother-in-law would be like.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, Ye Zichen was even more worried than Xiao Yumei. He took Su Yan to see his mom in the afternoon, and now he brought another one back within a few hours.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had no idea what his mom would think.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within the mansion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mother Ye was sitting in the courtyard blanking out when Ye Zichen took a deep breath and smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mom.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, you came back. You and Lil’ Yan…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just when she turned her head, she was stunned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She thought that Ye Zichen was alone, but who would have though that…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He brought a family over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hello, Auntie. I’m Xiao Yumei.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei’s entire body revealed the nervousness in her heart, it was the exact nervousness of a woman meeting her parents-in-law.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other side, Ye Zichen’s nervousness was no less than Xiao Yumei’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He continued to gulp, while he scratched his head with his hands out of nervousness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hello.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as if Mother Ye could not react from the shock. At that moment, Tiantian ran over with a giggle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hi grandma.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good, good, such a cute little fellow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tiantian’s appearance caused a kind smile to surface on Ye Rong’s face, while also breaking the tense atmosphere in the courtyard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come on in.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen held Tiantian’s hand and smiled towards Xiao Yumei, who glared at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, Ye Zichen’s heart jumped as he laughed dumbly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aiya, where’s Lil’ White! Mom, I think we lost Lil’ White, I’m going to find him. You guys have a chat.”</span></p>
