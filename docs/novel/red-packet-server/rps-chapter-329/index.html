<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p><span style>Chapter 329 – Who won?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Lu was definitely a dominating person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The title of Ice Empress was not just for show. Even though she looked petite and cute, if she actually became angry, everyone would tremble.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Lu also gradually opened up her palm as the temperature of the surrounding area lowered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rogue Immortal!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two hulks in front of the door frowned. They could already sense the danger that radiated from the young girl in front of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rogue immortals cannot use celestial spiritual energy above Earth Immortal level according to the rules. You are breaking the rules like this,” the bald man out of the two spoke up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Lu merely smiled, “Rules are for the weak. The rules are made by the strong. It is clear that I’m the strong one here, so your so-called rules don’t work on me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Tian was completely shocked. He never expected that the petite and cute girl in front of him was actually so strong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Judging from her aura, even the current family head of the Gu family cannot compare to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Either f*ck off, or die. Now, choose!” Lu Lu glared at them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two hulks standing guard hesitated for a moment, then moved aside with their teeth clenched.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph, that’s obedient!” Lu Lu frowned, then turned to smile towards Ye Zichen. “Do you see that? Power is the proper way. You’re nothing but a little piece of trash, and are way too weak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was very annoyed about being mocked, but he couldn’t say anything to counter it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was truly too weak, so since he couldn’t retort, he just shut up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gou Yuzhan, who was holding a chicken leg in his mouth, snickered. However, when Ye Zichen glared at him, Gou Yuzhan instantly lowered his head and avoided Ye Zichen’s gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Ru, listen to second aunt. As a girl, it isn’t suitable for you to show yourself outside. We, the Hua family, aren’t a business-oriented family, meanwhile fighting isn’t suitable for you at all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hua Zhiru stood alone in the center of the room while facing a middle-aged woman who had maintained herself rather well. That woman was Hua Zhiru’s second aunt, Hua Lihua.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A hint of a mocking smile flashed across Hua Zhiru’s eyes when she heard Hua Lihua’s words, “Then you want to tell me that it is suitable for you to show yourself in the public all the time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hua LIhua nodded, “There’s no helping it. Our Hua family doesn’t have any men, so the family head will have to be a woman. You are still young. How can second aunt let you take over my old man’s dangerous job? Second aunt is going all this for your own good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, for my own good,” a coldness surfaced on Hua Zhiru’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though her surroundings were already filled with Hua Lihua’s people, Hua Zhiru remained fearless as she scanned over everyone else in the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You guys, also agree with what my second aunt said, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everybody paused for a moment. Out of them, there were some people that were assistants to the Hua family’s old man back in the days of war. All of them clearly knew that Hua Zhiru was the proper successor of the Hua family.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the old man had already passed away. Hua Zhiru only had a weak foundation. Since people should recognize the situation, they had to stand on Hua Lihua’s side for their own benefits.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you aren’t speaking, then you are silently admitting it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hua Zhiru revealed a terrible expression. </span><i><span style>These people…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Were the closest people to my grandfather, and the people that he trusted most.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Hua Lihua’s face was filled with a confident smile. Inviting Hua Zhiru to this place was one of her ploys.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As long as Hua Zhiru dared to come, then she was confident that she could grab the position of the family head from her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Ru, listen to second aunt. Let go. That position is too high up, it isn’t suitable for the current you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That position is truly really high,” Hua Zhiru nodded, then said with a hint of ambition in her eyes. “But who doesn’t want to sit in the highest position? Second aunt, am I right!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Hua Lihua paused for a moment, before putting on a sinister expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Ru, you are forcing second aunt.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But isn’t second aunt also forcing me?” Hua Zhiru’s face also turned cold. She spoke with confidence and determination, “Everyone knows that I’m the number one successor in the entire Hua family. Is second aunt trying to steal what is rightfully mine by inviting me here and telling so many people to surround me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your words truly hurt second aunt’s heart,” Hua Lihua put on a fake smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hua Zhiru smiled mockingly, then turned around and disregarded the woman as she swept her gaze over the rest of the people in the room, “From now on, I’m in charge of the Hua family! If any one of you wants this position, then try and take it from me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, she started to walk forwards with a soft smile, “Anyone who dares to stop me will be blacklisted from the Hua family. From now on, it will only end with death!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hua Zhiru pursed her lips and stepped forward. Despite her calm demeanor, she was actually more nervous than anyone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One step…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two steps…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop her!” Hua Lihua screamed. At the same time, malice filled her face, “Lil’ Ru, you forced second aunt to do this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing the scream behind her, Hua Zhiru sighed, “Grandpa, sorry. I didn’t listen to you. Even though you clearly told me not to make a bet with other people, since I would only lose regardless of the bet, I didn’t listen. This time… I lost again!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had come without any backup plans, and purely wanted to bet everything on her actions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hua Zhiru shut her eyes submissively and essentially gave up her chance of resisting. Actually, it wasn’t that she wanted to resist, it was because she understood very clearly that resistance was futile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Hua, giving up like this isn’t good, is it?” playful laughter rang out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing his voice, Hua Zhiru opened her eyes, and saw Ye Zichen standing beside her with a faint smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for the crowd in the room…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m going to beat you to death for bullying the kind older sister. Just stand still for grandpa…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gou Yuzhan chased after the people in in the room with a pair of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nunchaku" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style>nunchaku</span></a><span style>. Meanwhile, Gu Tian did not stand idle either. He continuously made his way through the crowd and knocked people out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big-Big Brother Gu,” Hua Zhiru exclaimed with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She subconsciously reached her hands out to hold Ye Zichen’s arm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, a low voice rang out beside her ear, “Let go of him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she turned back, she noticed Lu Lu staring straight at her with flames of jealousy burning in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hua Zhiru couldn’t help but shudder due to the cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry, I was too worked up,” Hua Zhiru let go with a coy smile. Then she calmed herself down and looked at Hua Lihua with a faint smile. “Second aunt, I won this time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little bitch, do you think that you’ve really won?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone could tell from Hua Lihua’s way of addressing Hua Zhiru that she was going to bring all her past grudges to the surface.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hua Lihua’s sinister faze carried a faint bit of laughter, “You’re too naïve. Do you think that second aunt doesn’t have a backup plan?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Clap, clap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hua Lihua clapped. Then, she bowed behind her as the smile on her face became more apparent, “Sir, I’ll be troubling you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A laugh suddenly sounded out in the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, a man holding a folded fan walked down from the second floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My dear son, we finally meet!”</span></p>
