 <p><span style>“What a great chance this is!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi, stop acting like an idiot.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s roommates within the room started to try and convince him. However, Ye Zichen continued to look at Yang Yushi, who was beside Hu Hong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry, I made you guys come here for nothing,” Ye Zichen gave a deep bow, then pushed Zhang Rui and co. aside, before leaving the ward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was unable to calm down even leaving the ward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the door to the ward opened once again, and Yang Yushi ran over to Ye Zichen’s side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can we have a chat?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within a small coffee shop near the hospital.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Yushi deliberately pushed down her cap as they sat in seat in the corner. Despite doing that, quite a few people in the coffee shop recognized her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, the two of them became the center of attention in the coffee shop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Miss Yang, your coffee.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Err… Can you give me an autograph?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The waiter left joyously with Yang Yushi’s autograph. Meanwhile, Ye Zichen sat on the chair and casually stirred the coffee with a faint smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re really popular, aren’t you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, shouldn’t our reunion after so long be a happy thing? Why does it sound like mockery?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Yushi looked down slightly, revealing a faint troubling look in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows and smiled as if he didn’t understand, then drank the coffee in his cup without any milk at once.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s kind of bitter.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, have you been listening to me at all?” Yang Yushi raised her voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, I’m listening,” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows and leaned back on the chair. “I wasn’t targeting you when I gave my reply just now. I was speaking the truth. You are a trending star and I, a mere peasant, am very envious, is that not okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen turned silent when Yang Yushi shouted his name loudly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a long time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think I should get going. Someone might take a photo of a public figure like you being with me. It will have a negative impact for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stood up and prepared to leave, however Yang Yushi stood up and stopped him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why didn’t you agree when Hu Hong gave you the chance?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t want to enter the entertainment industry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re lying, you clearly told me three years ago that you wanted to be a singer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>“You have no right of being with my daughter at all. You’re the same kind of people.”</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>“Here is a million, take the money and leave my daughter.”</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>“Stop bothering my daughter, think about your mother.”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clenched his fists fiercely, then took several deep breaths…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t want to now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Yushi looked at up stared straight into Ye Zichen’s eyes with her bright and beautiful eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, then let me ask you. Is your promise from before still valid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Buzz…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s phone in his pocket rang. He took a look at the caller ID and saw that it was Xiao Yumei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My girlfriend is calling me. I’m going to go now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Girlfriend?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry, everything I said before were lies.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Yushi raised her hands and slapped Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rubbed his hurting cheek and smiled towards Yang Yushi. Then he paid the bill for the coffee before leaving the coffee shop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, do you and Yang Yushi know each other? I think she was already very famous when I was alive, how could you know her?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Jing continued to ask as she floated in midair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen frowned, “Why do you have so many questions?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m just curious!” Liu Jing went above Ye Zichen’s head and said. “I feel like there’s a story between the two of you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t you find yourself annoying?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen suddenly stopped and raised his eyebrows at Liu Jing, who floated in midair, “Stop mentioning her to me. If you mention her to me one more time, then I’ll get White Impermanence to take you to the Underworld.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Jing instantly stopped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen’s heart was already in chaos due to Liu Jing’s words.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Know her!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>He didn’t just know her!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Director Xiao, I can buy it using a high price. Please be merciful and give me a path to survival.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Dahai stood in front of Xiao Yumei’s jewelry store and begged. His actions had caused the shop to have almost no customers in the recent few days.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei frowned and looked at Bai Dahai, “Director Bai, can you not block our entrance? This is affecting my business.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Director Xiao, just agree to giving me some ores.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Dahai only did it because he had no other choice, jewelry businessmen like them needed to always pay attention to the situation in the stone gambling venues, they needed to have enough jade in order to support the jewelry store’s everyday activities.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen’s crazy sweep had caused it to be very hard to buy ores that could open up jade in the market.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Some smaller jewelry shops could survive, but he couldn’t.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was one of the top jewelry businessmen in the industry. He needed enough jade sources to support his business.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s actions had completely cut off all his path.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bai Dahai, what are you doing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately saw Bai Dahai, who was blocking off the entrance in order to beg Xiao Yumei, the moment he got off the taxi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei’s eyes brightened when she saw Ye Zichen, then she ran towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yumei.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen naturally held Xiao Yumei’s hand and walked in front of Bai Dahai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Bai, we all run businesses here. What the hell are you doing blocking off the shop like this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Ye… Mr. Ye! I have no other choice,” Bai Dahai’s already small eyes nearly squinted together. “We jewelers requires getting a few good ores on ore auctions in order to feed ourselves, but you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen instantly understood. It seems like his crazy sweep caused there to be a lack of jade in the ore auction circles, so this fatty was unable to do any business.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t think that what his thoughtless act would lead to such a consequence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled and shrugged, “Boss Bai, what goes around comes around. You didn’t forget how you bullied Yumei at the auction, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahh, Young Master Ye, that was me, Bai Dahai, having eyes but not recognizing Mt. Tai and having eyes with no pupils.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Dahai was about to cry. He only attacked Xiao Yumei’s company like that due to it being a request from someone else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Ye, you’re a great forgiving person, please be merciful and give me a path to survival. I have an eighty-years old mother and a baby that is waiting for milk…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Enough, enough, stop bullshitting with me here,” Ye Zichen waved his hand impatiently. </span><i><span style>What eighty-years old mother and baby waiting for milk.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Does he think that this was a TV show!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s simple if you want to survive! Didn’t you talk about merging with Yumei’s jewelry shop before? I’ll give you the chance, hand over fifty-one percent of the shares and become a subsidiary shop, then I’ll get Yumei to give you jade.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Ye…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The chance is in front of you, it’s all on you now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen wrapped his arm around Xiao Yumei’s waist with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go back and celebrate Tiantian’s birthday.”</span></p>
