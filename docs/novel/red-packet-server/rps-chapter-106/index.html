 <p><span style>Chapter 106 – I’m called Your Lungs Out</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen wandered towards the school as he swung his arms by his side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he thought back to Lin Xiyue’s look earlier, he felt that she was literally just an insane tigress.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That dumb woman, getting violent immediately after disagreements.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you going to do!” A weak shout sounded out from an alleyway. Ye Zichen followed the sound and saw several delinquents surrounding a girl that reeked of alcohol.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Beauty, let us bros take you home?” The green haired delinquent smiled naughtily and touched the girl’s cheek, while the other delinquents also occasionally felt her up. Although the girl tried her best to resist, the delinquents still found chances to take advantage of her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry up and move aside!” The girl pushed them with all her might. However, the delinquents smiled and instantly surrounded the girl.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t be like this, weren’t we having fun in the bar just now? Why did you suddenly turn unhappy?” With that, the green haired delinquent reached out his hand to grab the girl’s arm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let go of me,” the girl screamed in an attempt to fling his arm away. They did have fun in the bar, but she purely wanted to get them to buy her some drinks.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Which girl would buy their own drinks in a bar, don’t they all get others to buy it?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Nothing like this had happened when she did that before, who would have thought that she would meet such a group of shameless people this time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Move aside! If you don’t move aside, then I’m going to scream for help,” The girl glared at them and pursed her lips. When she raised her eyebrows, she looked like angry lion cub.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The delinquents on the side suddenly laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Green hair even laughed playfully, “Go ahead and scream! Even if you scream your lungs out, no one will come and save you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Err…” Before the green haired delinquent could finish his sentence, Ye Zichen raised his hand with a coy smile, “Then should I be called ‘Your Lungs Out’?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The drunk girl’s eyes instantly shimmered when she saw Ye Zichen, who had walked out from the corner, “Help me! Call the police!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The girl frantically waved her arms. Seeing that someone wanted to ruin their fun, some of the delinquents immediately surrounded Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brat, hurry up and f*ck off since laozi is in a good mood. Otherwise…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A shining fruit knife appeared in green hair’s hands. At the same time, the delinquents surrounding him also took out their fruit knives.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t know me?” Ye Zichen pointed at his nose.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The hell are you, why should laozi know you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen let out a soft sigh. Recently, all of the delinquents Ye Zichen met recognized him, so he thought that he was famous in those circles already.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed like it wasn’t enough.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, it’s fine if you don’t know me. I’ll let you get to know me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen raised his hands, grabbed hold of green hair’s arm and twisted, then did a sweep kick, causing the surrounding delinquents to fall onto the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, all of the delinquents surrounding the girl also rushed over, but they were like ant before an elephant before Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen easily dealt with the delinquents, then patted his hands as he smiled towards that green hair, “Ye Zichen, now you know me, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck, laozi remembers you now. Let’s go!” the green hair replied before scrambled away with his subordinates. When that happened, Ye Zichen turned around and wanted to tell the girl that it was safe…</span></p>
 <p><span style>But when he turned around, he saw that the girl was already gone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, that’s too heartless,” Ye Zichen shook his head with a smile. He had wanted to be a hero and save the beauty, but the girl just ran away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What made him even more speechless was that he didn’t even get a clear look at the girl!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Antique Street, Bingcheng City East</span></p>
 <p><span style>Creak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The creaking door opened, and a tired-looking girl walked in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man in the room replied without looking up as he fidgeted with the calligraphy in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you messing with that shitty painting all the time? You’ve never been so caring towards me even,” The girl took out a drink from the fridge and twitched her mouth at the man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you know? This is the real work of Bada Shanren!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, tsk. It’s the shitty drawing you bought with five million!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man frowned as he moved his nose, “Damn girl, you drank again. How many times did I tell you not to go out and drink so late? What if something happens? Can you make me less worried?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yea, yea, yea!” The girl nodded lazily and stretched. “I’m so tired, I’m going to sleep.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come back here, I’m not finished,” the man turned around to chase her. However, the girl pointed at the calligraphy with a smile, “Don’t chase after me. Don’t blame me if you lose the painting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man instantly blanked out for a moment, while the girl took the chance to bang her room door and lock it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monday arrived once again, meaning that it was the day to help Huang Yi open up his nerves once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, have some fruit,” Huang Shengmei smiled gently as she brought Ye Zichen some fruit. Ye Zichen could feel &nbsp;intense passion from her gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled with a nod.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, the sound of Huang Yi cursing could be heard from his room, “That retard!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s he doing in there?” Ye Zichen indicated towards Huang Yi’s room with his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Shengmei smiled, “He’s playing LoL or something like that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows and arrived at Huang Yi’s room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, he was sitting on a chair, and wearing a pair of headphones as he stared straight at the computer screen, while his hands furiously manipulated the keyboard and the mouse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stood silently behind him and watched him play out the team fight…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We lost!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Yi flung his earphones to the side when his champion died.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can come back,” Ye Zichen laughed softly behind him, causing Huang Yi to smiled in surprise, “Zichen-ge, why did you come? Did you come to treat my leg? Then just go ahead and &nbsp;start now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Yi became much brighter with the belief of being able to stand up one day. What’s more, recently, when Huang Shengmei helped him massage his leg with hot water, he could faintly feel the soreness from his leg.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He held infinite anticipation for Ye Zichen’s treatment. He firmly believed that as long as he cooperated with the treatment, there would be a day that he can stand up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re not going to play the game anymore?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s the point? Bot lane exploded.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can come back,” Ye Zichen laughed softly, then pushed him to the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen controlled Huang Yi’s top lane Vladimir and fight another team fight with his teammates.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His damage was through the roof.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And he directly aced the enemies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since it was already 40 something minutes into the game, and the respawn timers were rather long, Ye Zichen forcefully destroyed the enemy base.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen-ge, amazing. This is Challenger,” Huang Yi exclaimed with a shocked expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Ye Zichen was stunned, “You said this is Challenger?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, Challenger on Ionia.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen squinted his eyes and looked meaningfully at Huang Yi’s LP before turning his head around with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you interested in going pro?”</span></p>
