 <p><span style> Chapter 536 – Suspicion</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Choose from the clothes over here yourselves, but don’t choose overly conservative ones. You should still remember what kind of clothes the girl bands in the videos wore, right?” Ye Zichen pointed at the clothing shop filled with clothes and spoke to the Seven Fairies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay, Sky Sovereign,” the Seven Fairies ran in with a giggle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the looks of things, Ye Zichen felt as if they didn’t really hear him at all, and merely wanted to enter to pick what they liked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stood outside and shook his head, but didn’t stop them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the past two weeks, they did indeed work very hard, so it wasn’t a bad idea for them to relax a little.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen took a cigarette from his pocket and put it into his mouth, then stretched lazily outside of the shop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His phone rang. Ye Zichen took it out, then saw that it was a message from the interning White Impermanence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve investigated what you asked me to these past few days, but I didn’t find anything.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen licked his lips when he saw the message. Although the Jade Emperor didn’t care about the death of the heavenly soldier, he did.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During that evening, he had immediately asked White Impermanence to investigate and see if the deceased would appear in the Underworld. If he showed up and didn’t drink Meng Po’s soup, then help Ye Zichen ask the soldier about the situation then.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, from the message that White Impermanence sent over…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm, I understand. I’ve troubled you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s no need for you to be so courteous,” White Impermanence smiled. “Since the Modern Realm has been frozen, are you in the Three Realms now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!” Ye Zichen answered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>White Impermanence sent over another message, “Alright, I understand. I’ll come over to the Immortal Region to find you when I have time, but it won’t be anytime soon. The Underworld is in quite a bit of mess as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened in the Underworld?” Ye Zichen asked in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know either. People are all randomly dying over here. You should know that the people here are already ghosts, if they die again, then they would have really died. The Yama Kings and King Ksitigarbha are investigating into it, but they aren’t making much progress.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s eyebrows locked together even tighter when he read White Impermanence’s message.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>People are actually dying in the Underworld as well.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It was one thing if it’s happening normally, but at a times like this… There might be some connection between the random deaths in the Heavenly Court and Underworld.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright then, I have to go. I’ve got some stuff that I have to do. Talk to you later.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, White Impermanence stopped responding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen returned his phone to his pocket in a pondering manner, while the majority of his cigarette had already turned into a long pillar of ash.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only when the heat from his cigarette touched his finger did Ye Zichen return to his senses and chuck the cigarette butt away.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This is strange, but what sort of connection can there possibly be?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Approximately an hour later, Ye Zichen returned to the shop once again, and saw that the Seven Fairies had already finished picking out the clothes they liked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows when he saw their appearance.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>They really do kind of look like a girl band!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Tall red high heels, leather hot pants, suspenders… The fact that they revealed a large amount of skin also made them very eye catching.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, do you really think this is okay?” the Seven Fairies bit their lips. It was the first time they had worn anything like that, so they did felt a bit embarrassed.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wow.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen grabbed seven scarfs, and draped them around the fairies, then raised his eyebrows with a smile, “Not bad. It’s nearly time. Let’s head over!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The stage was set on an empty space on the eighteenth heaven by Yue Lao when he received the request from Ye Zichen three days prior.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen and the Seven Fairies arrived on the scene, he noticed that Yue Lao truly had not held back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was barely any difference with what a concert stage would look like in the Modern Realm. The only difference was the lack of an elevator.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As time passed on, Ye Zichen told the Seven Fairies to go over to the backstage to replenish their makeup.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As deities gradually arrived at the scene, the Red Packet Server also livened up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Barefoot Immortal: I really wonder what the visual feast Sky Sovereign talked about would be like?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Xiangzi: You still care about that after becoming a buddha?</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: You already have Immortal Lady He, you still care about this?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: You already have Mother of Lightning, you still care about this?</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Fortune: You already have the Third Princess, you still care about this?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The rest of the deities: Ahem…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Stop trying to cause trouble. We’re all people with families, we merely came here to support Sky Sovereign, understood?</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Yang Jijan is right. I definitely didn’t come here to see the Seven Fairies. I merely came to support Sky Sovereign.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mother of Lightning: Is that so? &lt;insert a row of sneering emojis&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Of course.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: I, Old Pig, is not like you guys. I just came to look at beauties, so what? I, Old Pig, just says whatever I think. I’m not like you guys who only make excuses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Stop trying to cause trouble here!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jade Emperor: How long until it begins?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment the deities in the group saw the Jade Emperor, they immediately stopped talking, put down their phones and looked around. Only to see a slightly chubby man in a golden robe stand in the sky and look at the stage in anticipation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jade Emperor seems to want to see it even more so than us,” Yang Jian nudged Canopy Marshal with his elbow and twitched his mouth. “He actually has the face to punish us. In my opinion, if you’re talking about playing around, he’s does it to an even greater extreme than we do.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah,” God of Fortune couldn’t help but snort. “But he’s the Jade Emperor, so nobody dares to piss him off.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Agreed!” God of Thunder nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Be quieter,” Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King Li flew over with Nezha and frowned. “If Jade Emperor hears that, you guys won’t be able to avoid some punishment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hello, uncles and older brothers,” Nezha cupped his hands towards the deities.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hi hi,” God of Fortune patted Nezha on the head, then snorted with a gloomy face. “Old Li, we’re not speaking bad things about the Jade Emperor behind his back, but his actions… Sigh, can’t you tell after so long?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s stop talking about it, there’s no need to. No matter what, he’s still the master of the Heavenly Court,” Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King Li signaled everyone to stop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Fortune twitched his mouth and wanted to say more, but God of Thunder grabbed him and shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How did your investigation go?” Leizhanzi raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn’t get anything. I went over to the manors of all the deities in the Heavenly Court, but there were no suspicious people except…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Except who!?” Yang Jian and co. asked nervously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King Li shook his head and replied, “I might have sensed it wrong, but I feel like there’s something strange with Count of Wind and Lord of Rain recently.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The two of them…” the deities in the surroundings all showed a hesitant expression and stopped talking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing their expressions, Heavenly King Li quickly spoke, “I might have guessed it wrong.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No… It might really be them,” at that very moment, a voice rang out behind the deities.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They turned their heads back, then put on drastically surprised expressions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Taibai!”</span></p>
