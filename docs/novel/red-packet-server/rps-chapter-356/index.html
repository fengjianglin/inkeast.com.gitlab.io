 <p><span style>Chapter 356 – A Chance Meeting With Qu Qitong</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was stunned, while a faint confusion look surfaced in his eyes, “Princess Iron Fan?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you looking at me like that? You don’t know Princess Iron Fan?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian immediately waved, “Nope. I’ve merely heard of her. She is not someone of the Heavenly Court, and so isn’t particularly familiar with you. If there’s anyone she’s familiar with, it’d be the monkey. He was once a chaotic demon lord with the Ox Demon King, so you should go to him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen naturally knew that. Since he had watched Journey to the West plenty of times, he really would have lived for nothing if he didn’t even know that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What he was curious about was how Princess Iron Fan managed to find his account since she wasn’t someone of the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen scratched his head and accepted the friend request.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Plantain Fan is in your hands, right!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but sigh when he saw the intimacy level of cold.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It seems like it’s not going to be a fun chat.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“It is in my hands. I want to ask…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can you return the fan to me?” Princess Iron Fan instantly replied. “I lost my Plantain Fan a while back when I went travelling. I looked for it for a long time!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why is my luck so bad?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but silently retort. </span><i><span style>I barely used this Plantain Fan and now the actual owner came to ask for it.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Excuse me, are you still there?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the intimacy level was cold, Princess Iron Fan’s tone was still extremely respectful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If she forced the issue more, then Ye Zichen might have made up his mind to stand firm on his decision to keep it. However, her attitude was completely proper, even if Ye Zichen wanted to keep the Plantain Fan, it would go against his own conscience.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, I’ll give it to you,” Ye Zichen reluctantly scanned the Plantain Fan and sent it to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Princess Iron Fan received your red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your intimacy level with Princess Iron Fan increased by 100. Intimacy level leveled up. Current intimacy level: Friendly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you so much. You really are a great person.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I got sent the good person card </span></i><span style><span><a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></span></span><i><span style>…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled wryly, then typed out his response.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Be careful not to lose it in the future. Not everyone would return this sort of divine item to you after picking it up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are right, I will pay attention in the future.” Princess Iron Fan replied politely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen tried to type out another sentence…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your message has been rejected!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck you!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stood up with his eyes wide open. </span><i><span style>She actually blocked me.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Originally, Ye Zichen had felt a bit of reluctance when returning the Plantain Fan, and had comforted himself by telling himself that he exchanged it for intimacy level..</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>But that girl’s too f*cking pragmatic. She immediately blocked me after I sent the Plantain Fan back?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>That woman…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen continuously retorted in his heart. At that moment, a figure suddenly appeared in front of Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen looked up, he saw an extremely beautiful woman in front of him. Meanwhile, Yang Jian, who was beside him, was completely dumbfounded, and his saliva was on the verge of dripping out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you so angry?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are?” Ye Zichen knitted his eyebrows slightly. He had no recollection of the woman in front of him at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can’t tell anymore?” the woman smiled softly, then glanced at Ye Zichen’s chest with a giggle. “You are currently cursing a woman in your heart, right? That woman stole your treasure?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qu Qitong!” Ye Zichen was stunned. Out of the people he knows, the only one who could read someone’s thoughts like that was Qu Qitong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, her face was full of scars when he last met her…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your face healed?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, I really have to thank the product you developed for it,” Qu Qitong smiled, and swept her fingers across her smooth cheek. “If it wasn’t for your product, I might still be unable to face others with my real face. You are my savior!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s no need to go to that extreme, right?” Ye Zichen smiled coyly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Yang Jian had a perverted look on his face, while he yanked Ye Zichen’s clothes stealthily and signaled Ye Zichen to introduce him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hello Ye Zichen’s friend. Qu Qitong,” any small movements were obvious in front of the woman. She took the initiative and reached her hand out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, Yang Jian quickly wiped his hand on his shorts and smiled, “Hello, hello. I’m his bro! You are so pretty, even more so than Chang’e, who’s in the heavens.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This gentleman really knows how to joke,” Qu Qitong covered her mouth and giggled. From the looks of it, she really liked Yang Jian’s flattery.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m telling the truth!” Yang Jian chuckled idiotically. “You really are prettier than Chang’e.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You speak as if you have really seen Chang’e,” Qu Qitong replied with a soft smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that Yang Jian seemed to want to continue the conversation, Ye Zichen quickly covered his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That woman was no simple woman. If he let Yang Jian continue to blabber on…</span></p>
 <p><span style>She might be able to guess that Yang Jian is Erlang Shen. Even though that was rather shocking for mortals… This woman seemed different from other mortals.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh?” Qu Qitong raised her eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s heart raced when he saw her meaningful smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He did like dealing with beauties, but not with beauties who are overly smart. One example of that was the Qu Qitong in front of him…</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he chatted with her, he felt as if he was stripped naked in front of her. It felt really weird.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry. I didn’t guess anything. Boss Ye, your friend is not normal!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>And you say that you didn’t guess anything?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, you can actually tell that I’m not normal. Can you feel that my…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smacked Yang Jian’s head. </span><i><span style>You still want to show off in front of this woman at a time like this?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t say anything!” Ye Zichen glared at him, then changed the topic with a chule. “The sky is great. The capital’s sky isn’t as bad as what the people from Bingcheng said.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Ye, you changed the topic way too forcefully!” Qu Qitong said with a smile. “Why not ask me why I’m here instead?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm, why are you here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen did decide to use his shameless ability. </span><i><span style>Since you taught me what to ask, then I’ll ask.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Seriously, you…” Qu Qitong shook her head slightly helplessly, then pointed at the car behind her. “Maintaining Beauty Corporation is going to set up a branch company in the capital. I’m going to the ribbon-cutting!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Establishing a branch? So fast?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maintaining Beauty Corporation had only been established for a bit more than a month. Ye Zichen was truly unable to imagine them setting up a branch in the capital in such a short amount of time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You really are laid back as the hands-off owner. Right now, it really is understating it by saying that Maintaining Beauty has its income measured in gold… You will definitely be awestruck after seeing the transaction amount,” Qu Qitong smiled, then pointed at the backseat of her car with raised eyebrows. “Do you want to go together? Director Xiao is there as well!”</span></p>
