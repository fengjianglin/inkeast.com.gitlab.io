 <p><span style>Chapter 333 – Nobody was Wrong</span></p>
 <p><span style>The soft voice caused Ye Zichen to pause. He looked at the woman in front of him blankly. Then, a blood red tear flowed down from the corner of his eye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mom…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re tired. Rest,” Ye Rong caressed his hair softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s blinked, while his eyes welled up with tears.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His blood-colored hair and irides gradually returned to their originally color, while his bronze skin also gradually returned to normal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A wave of fatigue overwhelmed him, before he fell headfirst into Ye Rong’s arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did you come to the capital?” the man on the ground squinted at her and asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Rong smiled and looked at him, who had been beaten to a pulp by Ye Zichen, then smiled coldly, “If I were you, then I would be running away now. If I didn’t come, you would already be dead.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ridiculous!” the man replied maniacally. “Our son has already lost the powers of a Fallen due to your call. Right now… Who can actually stop me? Let me suggest to you guys. Hurry up and f*ck off before I finish healing myself!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that so?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Rong instantly released rays of dazzling sacred light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she held Ye Zichen, she appeared like an untainted angel, who smiled at the man on the ground, “Do you really think that…. You can really match up to me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…” the man looked at the scene in front of him in shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He twitched his mouth and muttered a few words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A pitch black wormhole appeared in front of him. At the same time, his body also was gradually sucked into it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right before he closed the wormhole, he smiled sinisterly, “You actually managed to awaken my good son from the state of a Fallen. It seems like your feelings as parent and child really do run deep. Due to this first time, he should be even more natural at controlling his Fallen powers. I definitely will not leave a treasure like him to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck off… Before I change my mind,” Ye Rong radiated the sacred light from her body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man’s pupils contracted, then snuck into the wormhole. However, the room continued to echo his cold laugh, “I will snatch that brat away.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The wormhole disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone looked at the scene in front of them in shock. Everything that happened was already up to the level of a huge blockbuster with wings and light emitting from their bodies…</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as amazing as Hollywood’s special effects!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you guys Zichen’s friends?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Rong carried Ye Zichen over to Gu Tian and co. She put her hand on Lu Lu’s shoulders, causing the latter to be instantly healed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Body Double, I hope I can meet your main body when you have some time,” Mother Ye smiled softly, then looked at Fatty Yin. “Two souls… Taking over someone else’s body is not a good habit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Lu’s and Fatty Yin’s face were covered in shock, while Ye Rong set her gaze on Gu Tian, “Are you Ol’ Three’s child?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aun-Auntie!” Gu Tian pursed his lips and replied in a testing manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Rong smiled, then rubbed her head, “Good boy, you truly look exactly the same as your father. Back then, only your dad stood up against the old man’s decision.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Auntie, my father has always missed you. He said that you were the best to him when he was young.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, when we were children, your dad and I were great siblings,” Ye Rong smiled softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Hua Lihua struggled up from the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she saw everything in the room, and that the man had disappeared…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems like you guys have other things to take care of here, so I won’t intrude any longer. Zichen’s tired, I’m taking him back to rest,” Ye Rong smiled and left the room with Ye Zichen in her arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone in the room looked at Ye Rong’s retreating back in shock, then set their gazes upon Hua Lihua.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How’s that possible!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen suddenly screamed and sat up from the bed. He looked at his surroundings in confusion, and noticed that he was no longer in Linhe Garden.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fragments of memories appeared in his mind…</span></p>
 <p><span style>In those fragments, he grew wings from his body. He was very strong, and had managed to beat the man up to a pulp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Mother Ye seemed to have appeared at the very last moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clutched his head in pain. At the same time, the door to the room was pushed open, and Ye Rong walked in with a towel and a basin of water.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, you’re awake.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mother Ye’s tone remained as soft as always.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen looked up and saw her kind smile…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mom, why-why did you come?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ve always been clumsy, so how can I not worry about you when you’re off by yourself?” Mother Ye smiled kindly. After that, she touched his forehead and nodded. “It isn’t hot anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pursed his lips at his mother’s kind smile, then frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had way too many things that he wanted to ask.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know there are loads of stuff that you want to ask about, but don’t ask… okay?” Mother Ye begged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clenched his teeth and nodded, “Then can you tell me just one thing? That man…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He wasn’t wrong!” Mother Ye smiled faintly, while forgiveness could be heard in her tone. “None of it was his wrongdoing. Perhaps, it was our union itself that was a mistake. However, it was not your grandfather’s fault either. Discarding me for the family was the correct choice.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then you’re admitting that I’m someone from the Gu family, right?” Ye Zichen forced a sad smile to his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Actually, you already knew a long time ago, right?” Mother Ye smiled softly, then got off the bed and opened the curtains. As she looked down at the passing car, she spoke up once again. “As for whether you’re someone from the Gu family, that’s for you to decide. If you want… Then you are! If you don’t want to, then so what if I say you are?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The only thing I know is that my surname is Ye,” Ye Zichen said with utter certainty. He held no goodwill towards the Gu family at all, even if Mother Ye forgave them and even went as far as to find excuses for them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the truth is the truth. Even if they manage to put it in a completely different manner…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mother Ye had become the family’s sacrifice and ended up with a man like that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then our surname will be Ye,” Mother Ye turned back. “Actually, I like the surname Ye quite a bit. Ever since I left the Gu family, I fell in love with this surname immediately after being given it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Creak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen secretly clenched his fist. He could feel just how depressed Mother Ye was in her heart when she said that.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>She became the family’s sacrifice, and even had her own surname taken away from her.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Then had to endure being with a man she does not know!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Gu family!” Ye Zichen frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he uttered that quietly, Mother Ye turned back with a smile, “Don’t think about getting back at them for me. There is no need for that. I have already gotten past that a long time ago. By the way, I never actually expected you to meet someone from the Gu family.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm, the reason I came to the capital this time was to help Gu Tian gain the position of the junior family head!” Ye Zichen nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Junior family head…?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mother Ye’s soft smile suddenly froze, as she halted her words.</span></p>
 <p></p>

 <p><b>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</b>Who...</p>
 <p><strong>Mysterious White Hand Person:&nbsp;</strong>It's me. You worked hard today and tired yourself out. You can rest now.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>But... <em>(falls unconscious)</em></p>
 <p><strong>Papa Ye(?):&nbsp;</strong>Haha, I don't know who you... Wait, it's you. Ahaha, do you think that there is anything any of you can do now that he fainted?</p>
 <p><strong>Mysterious White Hand Person:&nbsp;</strong>Yes, there is plenty that we can do. Now, let me give you two options. Either leave, or...</p>
 <p><strong>Papa Ye(?):&nbsp;</strong>Or what? You're going to kill me? Haha, none of you are even capable of that.</p>
 <p><strong>Mysterious White Hand Person:&nbsp;</strong>I'll be happy to prove you wrong you know?</p>
