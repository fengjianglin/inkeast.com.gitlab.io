 <p>As soon as Ye Zichen spoke, Chi Mei knew she’d have to take the blame for this.</p>
 <p>He obviously didn’t want to let Chen Jiannan go, but he still pushed that onto her? But when she thought about it, she had no love for the Xiao Family either. Although she disdained to take action against a mere sky supreme, if Ye Zichen wanted to get rid of him, she might as well lend a hand.</p>
 <p>“That’s right!” she said,” I still haven’t said you could leave.”</p>
 <p>Compared to Ye Zichen, Chi Mei was far more straightforward.</p>
 <p>She glanced meaningfully at Elder Liu. The surrounding supremes saw the elder gently tap the air, and Chen Jiannan disappeared before their very eyes.</p>
 <p>No one knew what had happened to him, but Elder Liu’s methods made the supremes’ hearts tremble.</p>
 <p>Rulers sure lived up to their reputation. They really did rule over everything around them.</p>
 <p>“Not bad, not bad at all.” Ye Zichen smiled in satisfaction. Chen Jiannan had tried to kill him earlier, and moreover, had killed his friends. He was the main culprit who’d forced Ye Zichen into the Yao-Sealing Pagoda for three full years, too.</p>
 <p>Ye Zichen would have to lose his wits to let someone like that go.</p>
 <p>“Hey hey, I did well, right? Shouldn’t you give me some ‘encouragement,’ sweetie?” She gleefully stuck her hands behind her back and batted her eyes coquettishly.</p>
 <p>“Don’t make a fuss!” said Ye Zichen helplessly. “What kind of ‘encouragement’ could I even give you?”</p>
 <p>“What are you talking about! The Xuan-Yuan Sword and Yao-Sealing Pagoda are both top-class divine artifacts. If you gave me either one, I’d be so happy, I’d burst into tears!” Chi Mei’s eyes narrowed into slits as she scanned the pagoda up and down.</p>
 <p><em>She wants the Yao-Sealing Pagoda too?</em> Ye Zichen couldn’t help but murmur to himself.</p>
 <p>No, that shouldn’t be the case!</p>
 <p>If she really wanted the Yao-Sealing Pagoda, she could have taken it three years ago, but she didn’t. There was no need for her to wait this long.</p>
 <p>Or was it just that, at the time, she didn’t think she was strong enough to take it? But now she had a ruler…</p>
 <p>“Haha, look at your face! I really scared you, huh? I was just joking!” When Chi Mei saw Ye Zichen standing there in silence, she reached out and grabbed him by the arm. “What’s yours is mine, and what’s mine is yours. It doesn’t matter which of us has the treasure, does it, sweetie?”</p>
 <p>When he saw how intimate Chi Mei was being with Ye Zichen, Elder Liu frowned. “Miss, we should be on our way. If we delay any longer, Xiao Hu might escape the Outside. When I attacked him, I sensed his strength; he might already be a ruler.”</p>
 <p>“Then you can hurry up and go after him. It’s not like I can’t go back on my own,” said Chi Mei.</p>
 <p>“Miss!” Elder Liu’s tone darkened.</p>
 <p>Ye Zichen was fully aware of the real reason the old man had spoken up. He didn’t want Chi Mei to cling to him either, so he decided to help out. “Go on back with Elder Liu. I can take care of these guys myself.”</p>
 <p>“Are you in such a rush to get rid of me?” She wrinkled her nose and snorted at him, then inexplicable swiped at the mountain range sealing Denglong.</p>
 <p>One of Denglong’s souls appeared in her palm, and at the same time, she tossed Ye Zichen a pearl. “Here, take back your Yiyuan Soul Pearl. I’ve got a use for Denglong’s soul, so I’ll take it with me.”</p>
 <p>With that, she walked up to Elder Liu. The crowd saw nothing but a flash of fluorescent light as they disappeared from the wastes, taking all the yao with them.</p>
 <p>Once Chi Mei was gone, Ye Zichen sighed in relief. He thought himself rather experienced with women, but Chi Mei was the toughest opponent he’d encountered yet. When she was around, he felt like one little slip-up meant falling into her trap.</p>
 <p>He clenched the Yiyuan Soul Pearl. He feared that sealing Denglong’s soul had exhausted far too much of its soul power.</p>
 <p>Ye Zichen tried to make contact with Tenner, but got no response. For a divine artifact like this, all it needed to recover was time, so he simply placed the pearl into the Yao-Sealing Pagoda. If Xuan-Yuan Xiang left seclusion and saw it, she might even know a shortcut to speed the pearl’s recovery.</p>
 <p>“As for you guys…” His gaze fell on the human supremes, who hadn’t left yet. In truth, they wanted to leave a long time ago, but after what happened to Chen Jiannan, they just stood there in a daze.</p>
 <p>Although the ruler had already left, Ye Zichen still had the Yao-Sealing Pagoda’s army. They still couldn’t afford to offend him, so they responded as soon as Ye Zichen spoke. “Please, go on, your Excellency.”</p>
 <p>“You needn’t be so nervous.” Ye Zichen gestured for them to relax, then said, “You’ve already bought back your lives, and you’ve been straight with me, so I won’t harm you. It’s just, before you leave, there’s something I must warn you about.”</p>
 <p>When he saw he had their full attention, Ye Zichen continued, “When you get back, please keep your lips sealed. I don’t want you to spread any news of what happened here, especially about the Xuan-Yuan Sword or the Yao-Sealing Pagoda.”</p>
 <p>“Your Excellency, all three realms already know about the Xuan-Yuan Sword. As for the Yao-Sealing Pagoda, even if we keep quiet, when those two diviners get back….”</p>
 <p>“I just need you to keep quiet,” said Ye Zichen in a low voice.</p>
 <p>“Understood. We’ll be sure to keep our mouths shut.” Quite a few sky supremes went so far to swear by their inner demons. The others thought it over, then followed suit.</p>
 <p>When they finished, Ye Zichen nodded indifferently at them. “Go on, then.”</p>
 <p>The supremes reacted as if they’d received a divine pardon. They each cupped their fists in farewell and disappeared from the wastes.</p>
 <p>The supreme from the Sea of Innocence, who Ye Zichen had called to his side, cupped his hand as well. “Brother Ye, our Sea of Innocence will remember this kindness forever.”</p>
 <p>“It’s nothing. You helped me before, so I’m simply returning the favor.” Ye Zichen smiled at him, then said, “There’s something I’d like to ask you about. Is the Wish God at the Sea of Innocence?”</p>
 <p>“Brother Ye, you know the Wish God?”</p>
 <p>“We’re old acquaintances, I suppose. How has he been lately?”</p>
 <p>“He’s doing well, as always.”</p>
 <p>With that, Ye Zichen lost interest in chatting, and the sky supreme didn’t have anything else to say either. He nodded at Ye Zichen. “Brother Ye, if you have time, please pay our Sea of Innocence a visit and enjoy our hospitality. Farewell!”</p>
 <p>“Farewell!!”</p>
 <p>When the representative of the Sea of Innocence, the supreme from the Four Directions Palace soon followed suit. “Brother Ye, I’ll be on my way too, then.”</p>
 <p>“Mmhm.” Ye Zichen nodded at him, then added, “If you get the chance, please greet Cui Twelve on my behalf. Tell him that if he has spare time, I’d like to invite him out for a drink. Also, if you see Liu Qing, tell her I’ve ascended to the God Realm.”</p>
 <p>“I didn’t realize you were friends with the Twelfth and Seventeenth Highnesses. Alright, when I get back, if I get the chance to stand before their highnesses, I’ll be sure to share your message.” The supreme smiled. Ye Zichen met his gaze with his earlier indifference.</p>
 <p>The supreme cupped his fist one last time. “This kindness is too great for mere words of gratitude. Farewell!”</p>
