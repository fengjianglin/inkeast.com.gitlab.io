 <p><span style>Chapter 67 – Requisitioning your car</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chief Liu’s wife, Bai Yun, had already woken up by the time Ye Zichen arrived at their home.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Ye, I’m so sorry, I troubled you to specifically rush over here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sat on the living room’s sofa, while Chief Liu smiled apologetically. At this moment, Bai Yun brought them some fruit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Ye, thank you for saving our family’s Old Liu.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sis is too courteous…” Ye Zichen replied with a smile. However, the hair on his back instantly stood up when he raised his head and looked at Bai Yun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Yun looked very young, since the passing of time did not leave too much of a trace on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen could tell that she was deeply troubled from her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The troubles were heavy enough to crush her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, what truly shocked him was that, she and Liu Qing…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Looked exactly the same.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen turned his head with open eyes and saw that Liu Qing was pursing her lips tightly. Ye Zichen could tell the emotions that she wanted to express, but also tried hard to hide.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Ye,” Chief Liu called out. Hearing that, Ye Zichen came back to his senses and suppressed the shock in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen took out the Great Recovery Pill he had prepared from his pocket and placed it on to the table. When Chief Liu saw this jade bottle, he immediately waved it away and refused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Ye, this is too valuable.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Liu-ge, if you don’t accept this, then you are looking down on this little bro of yours.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen didn’t know any medical skills, the only thing he could do here was to give Chief Liu a Great Recovery Pill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, he started to leave. Before leaving, Ye Zichen sighed, “Liu-ge, sis’s yearning has clearly turned into a sickness. The Great Recovery Pill can indeed treat diseases, but it can’t treat the problems in one’s heart. If you have time, then bring sis to a therapist.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ai, alright…” When Ye Zichen mentioned this, Chief Liu immediately sagged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded, then signaled Chief Liu that there was no need to send him back to his car.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen closed the car door with force and locked it, then frowned towards Liu Qing, who was beside him, “Tell me the truth. What sort of relationship do you have with Liu-ge and his family?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing and Bai Yun pretty much came out of the same mold. What’s more, Ye Zichen had saw a family photo of the three people in Chief Liu’s family.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The girl in the very center of the photo was Liu Qing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They are my parents.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen leaned unenergetically onto the car seat and shook his head. Then he lowered the car window and helped himself light a cigarette.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, why are you like this,” Liu Qing yanked his arm after seeing Ye Zichen’s expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was truly unsure of what to do. It was true that he was already ready to accept the trouble that will occur that would be caused when he decided to bring Liu Qing back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The daughter of the city’s police chief.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>This was kind of outside the range which he could accept.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen did have a bit of heroism, but no matter what, he was still a normal puny citizen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen scratched his head, then chucked the cigarette out of the car window and leaned on his chair for a long time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Liu Qing, I really couldn’t tell.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing looked at him nervously. Ye Zichen, who had a serious expression until now, suddenly smiled and reached his hand out to rub her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Say, if I bring you back to life and help you take revenge, just what sort of benefits would the city’s police chief give me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing suddenly tensed when she saw Ye Zichen’s smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She clearly understood just how major of a promise Ye Zichen’s words held. She pursed his lips and didn’t answer for a long time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rubbed her head once again, “Alright now, don’t worry, I won’t regret it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen slowly started the car with a warm smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing dumbly looked at him, who was smiling, as she sat in the front seat. She had a lot of weird feelings in her heart, but the main thing was powerlessness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If she was still alive, she might truly fall in love with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s thoughts were very chaotic as he drove.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He did have the thought of giving up at the start, since the situation was at a level that he couldn’t manage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he just couldn’t bear to do that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen called Xiao Yumei with the wish of going over to her house, but this strong woman shut him down by telling him that she was still in a factory.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who stopped by the side of the road, suddenly heard the sound of someone hitting on the window.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He rolled down the window and raised his eyebrow, “Officer Lin, what are you going? I didn’t do anything.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Open up, open up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Officer Lin’s tone was full of anxiousness. Ye Zichen looked at her and tilted his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why should I?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Creak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before Ye Zichen finished, Officer Lin directly reached her hand into the car and pull opened the car door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Starting from now, I’m going to requisition your car. Give me your car keys.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Requisition.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>She’s on a mission?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows, and thought of the previous times when this dumb woman was opposing him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, go and requisition someone else’s car. My car is way too expensive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have no time to bullshit with you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grab.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Officer Lin directly pulled Ye Zichen off the car, then sat down. Ye Zichen glared at her and quickly walked over to the front passenger seat, opened the car door, then sat back down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Get out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is my car, what right do you have to make me get off? Even if you are a police officer, you can casually take someone’s car? What you’re doing is a robbery!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fine, then just sit there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Officer Lin directly stepped down on the pedal. Due to the speed, Ye Zichen was slammed onto the back of the seat. Just as he wanted to curse, he subconsciously glanced at the speedometer when he saw the fleeting images outside the window.</span></p>
 <p><span style>200 miles per hour.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you crazy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>How the hell was this driving a car, she was clearly piloting a plane!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t disturb me, you know how fast this, right? The two of us will die together if I lose concentration even for a moment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Officer Lin spoke with a hint of threat. Hearing that, Ye Zichen instantly sat obediently and properly on the chair and put on his seat belt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fine. He submitted in front of his life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within ten odd minutes, the car had already left the city.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where are you driving me to? If we run out of petrol, there isn’t a gas station there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Officer Lin slammed down on the brakes and the car slid to a stop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zzzz…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slithers of smoke floated up as the tires rubbed against the ground. Ye Zichen also was flung forward and nearly hit his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is there something wrong with you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop talking, just stay here,” however, Officer Lin ignored his cursing and looked at him with an ice-cold stare, then took out two guns.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She loaded the guns.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then got out of the car.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gulp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen gulped. He had played with a lot of toy guns before, but the shock was still pretty powerful when the real deal appeared in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Take care, Officer Lin.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen said his farewells to Officer Lin with a coy smile. Then, when she disappeared from his site, Ye Zichen got onto the driver’s seat and prepared to drive away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang, bang.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Gunshots.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s hand on the car key trembled.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck, a fight started.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>This was a real-life gun battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, no, I have to hurry away,” Ye Zichen muttered tremblingly. Yet, not long later, he took his hands away from the car key.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Liu Qing, go and see what’s the situation over there.”</span></p>
