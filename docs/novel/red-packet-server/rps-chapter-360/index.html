 <p><span style>Chapter 360 – Shifting the Blame</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the Gu household.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The huge manor was filled with people, many of which hold guns, knives or metal bats, making it seem like they were about to start fighting at any moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Family Heads of various clans, what are you guys doing here?” the Gu family head looked at the people in front of him, while the new Gu family head, Gu Tian, stood beside him. Behind them were some of the Gu family’s tribesmen and guest chamberlains, but due to the incident that happened on the day of the junior family head election, the overall strength of the Gu family was severely weakened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, there weren’t a lot of people that came out to meet the enemies, making it seem like they were unable to win in a battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gu Hai, we hidden families had always been like the well and the river, but your family actually assassinated the elites of our various families… Shouldn’t you give us an explanation?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, what explanation? I think the Gu family is just getting ambitious, and want to weak us various clans in order to continue being the leader!” other family heads began to speak up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, the beautiful woman standing at the very front also questioned, “Gu family head, is what they said correct?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zhuge family head, how are we supposed to accept the crimes you have pinned on us! All families know that we have recently been electing our junior family head, so how are we supposed to assassinated your elites?” Gu Hai knitted his eyebrows tightly together, then laughed coldly. “I think that… You guys saw that the Gu family’s strength has weakened, and so wanted to take this chance to engulf us whole, right! A starved camel is still larger than a horse, are you guys not worried about being too stuffed?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gu Hai, have you no shame?” asked a scar-faced middle-aged man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shangguan Xiong, don’t think that I don’t know you eyeing the position of the Gu family for a long time. The reason that all these families are here is because you had continuously blamed us, the Gu family, for everything. Hehe… You want to accuse the Gu family of assassinating your elites? Show me your proof!” a cold smile covered Gu Hai’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the other family heads instantly hesitated.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Proof?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>They didn’t have any.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, their elites had indeed been killed. They had researched it for several days, and the conclusion they managed to come to was that someone in the Gu family did it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason they came together was to force the Gu family to admit it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you want proof? I’ve got it!” all of a sudden, a playful laughter sounded out in everyone’s ear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gu Li!” a thin figure slowly entered everyone’s sight. Gu Li smiled faintly and swept his gaze across everyone’s faces, “Gu family, Gu Li!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How is it you!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both Gu Tian and the rest of the Gu tribesmen were shocked. That day…</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had saw Gu Li’s head get chopped off by a demon with their own eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, are you very surprised to see me?” Gu Li smiled playfully, then bowed towards the other family heads. “Family Heads, this kid is originally Gu Li of the Gu family. However, the Gu family was unfair during the junior family head election, and wanted to kill me off… However, I did not die despite everything.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gu Li!” Gu Tian knitted his eyebrows and roared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Li mockingly picked his ears, “What are you shouting for? You want to show off how loud you are? What? You’re pissed that you didn’t kill me? What a good brother!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brat, you said that you have the proof of the Gu family assassinating our clans’ elites?” Shuangguang Xiong frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Li nodded with a smile, “I had wanted to hide it for the Gu family, but since they were unjust towards me, they should not blame me for doing the same!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, he took out a USB from his pocket and a laptop from his backpack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Family heads, please watch!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The family heads hesitated and received the laptop and clicked open the video file within the USB…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh yeah, how are the things I got you to do going?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s already being done. The tribesmen of three of the hidden families have already been killed by is. We have their souls right now…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Very good. Make sure that the blame is shifted onto my brothers. Understood?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>One of the two people involved in the video was not seen, and his voice was edited, but the other person was Hua Li, who stood beside Gu Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The video was very short, but after the video ended, all the family heads looked towards Hua Li murderously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As everyone knows, Hua Li is the most trusted person beside my Tian-ge. Even though the other person in the video was not shown, I believe everyone here are intelligence. I can reveal that this video was taken threw a camera I installed at Gu Tian’s place. As for why I did so… It was the junior family head election a while back, so I’m sure you family heads can understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The beautiful Zhuge woman also smiled, “Gu family head, I think everything has come to light!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Impossible, I have never plotted to assassinate the elites of these various families,” Gu Tian frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It isn’t you, but the old man beside you must have been involved, right?” the scar-faced Shuangguan Xiong sneered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Tian immediately shook his head, “That’s impossible as well. Elder Hua is the person closest to me. It’s impossible for him to do anything that would betray me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Gu Hai’s expression drastically changed. He had already made up his mind to give up Hua Li, but Gu Tian’s reply clearly tied the two together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Li’s smile bloomed even more.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>My idiot older brother, you are truly idiotic to the point of being cute.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“This is impossible, that’s impossible… Lad, do you think we family heads are stupid?” Shangguan Xiong snorted with a cold gaze. “Gu Hai, hand this brat and the old man beside him to us, then hand over fifty percent of the Gu family’s resources. Then we’ll leave it at that!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the surrounding family heads nodded. Rage surfaced on Gu Hai’s old face. He clenched his fist and roared, “Shangguan Xiong, wishful thinking! Heh, if you want to engulf us, the Gu family, we’ll at least make you lose a few teeth! Gu tribesmen, prepare to fight!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gu Hai, just why are you doing this!” The Zhuge woman shook her head sadly, then turned to the people behind her. “Zhuge family members, do not go up… If they don’t make a move against us, then we’ll just watch!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zhuge family head…” Shangguan Xiong’s expression drastically changed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman merely smiled in response, “We, the Zhuge family had no losses. Before coming here, I did not promise to deal with the Gu family with you guys. Sorry, but we, the Zhuge family is not getting involved in this mess.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you, Zhuge family head!” Gu Hai cupped his hands towards the woman, while solemnity covered his old face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A powerful spiritual pressure radiated out from his body!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zhuge Hong, wow…” Shangguan Xiong stepped forward furiously, while the aura around him fought back against Gu Hai’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do it!” as Shangguan Hong roared, the people of the other families all rushed towards the Gu family.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment, a blinding golden light landed in the middle of them all like a meteor, while a cold voice shouted from within the light, “Those who step forward. Die!”</span></p>
