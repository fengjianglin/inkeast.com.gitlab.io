 <p><span style>Chapter 166 – Thirty Million Cultivation Experience</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sat leisurely on the sofa within the VIP room of the jewelry store, while crossing his legs and smoking a cigarette.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He raised his eyebrows and looked at Zu Siliang, who hadn’t yet spoken.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Zu, just say why you came to see me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lin Hanben asked me to come.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s expression immediately darkened before Zu Siliang finished speaking. He casually put out his cigarette in the ash tray and said playfully, “I didn’t think you had contact with Lin Hanben.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’re both from the capital. The Lin family have some ability in the capital too, so knowing each other is normal,” Zu Siliang nodded, then smiled. “It seems like there are some issues between you two.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s a huge issue.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The mocking smile on Ye Zichen’s mouth became even more apparent as he thought about what happened to him at the Lin household, "If you want to be a middleman, then I feel like… It’s impossible.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A light flashed across Zu Siliang’s eyes as he asked in a testing manner, “Can you tell me the reason?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen told Zu Siliang about what Lin Hanben and Lin Lin did in a simplified manner, Zu Siliang’s warm smile froze, “It actually was like this. It seems like I’ve been used by Lin Hanben.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A faint rage could be seen on his face, clearly showing that he was very unhappy with Lin Hanben in his heart as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pursed his lips and shrugged helplessly with a smile, “Kinda similar to Yang Yushi’s father. They’re both arrogant fellows.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s not really good to speak of Uncle Yang in front of me like this, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Could it be that you don’t feel like it’s the case? What a pity, I thought we heroes would share a view.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zu Siliang chuckled without answering.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Ye Zichen also stood up, “If there isn’t anything else, then I’m leaving.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen turned around in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zu Siliang walked towards him, “Yushi wants to see you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s untamed look wavered for a moment when Yang Yushi was mentioned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He pursed his lips and smiled after a brief hesitation, “Never mind.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But Yang…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zu Siliang still wanted to continue, but Ye Zichen’s phone suddenly rang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen quickly took out his phone. When he saw that Han Xiangzi had sent him a message, he finally remembered that he had important business to attend to.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s all I have to say. Say hi to Yang Yushi for me. I have other stuff to busy myself with here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen hurried away from the VIP room and replied to Han Xiangzi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Immediately.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within the Heavenly Court’s Eight Immortal Manor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Xiangzi was truly beyond obedient. Since Ye Zichen told him to wait, he just stared intently at the phone without doing anything else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His phone vibrated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Han Xiangzi saw Ye Zichen’s reply, he quickly stood up from the chair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen arrived at the counter after seeing Han Xiangzi’s reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Shuang continued to wear the clerk uniform. However, after being promoted to a shop manager, the joy and faint dominating air could not longer be hidden.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She felt extremely thankful towards this person that gave her such fortune. If it hadn’t been for him, it was unknown how long she would have had to continue being a clerk.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Opportunities always disappeared in a moment.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Since she managed to grab hold of it this time, she wouldn’t let go no matter what.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Take out the rings I mentioned earlier.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A row of rings were set on the counter, causing the heart of Xia Keke, who was beside Ye Zichen, to jump out.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Was he going to buy it for me!?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is it going to be for me?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>She continued to repeat that in her heart, yet, she saw…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Snap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen took a bunch of photos without touching the rings at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen went into his chat with Han Xiangzi and sent them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Xiangzi’s phone rang within the Eight Immortal Manor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“These are…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Xiangzi revealed a confused expression. He thought Ye Zichen was going to teach him some sort of secret scripture for dating. He didn’t expect Ye Zichen to send him a bunch of photos.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great deity, you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes when he saw Han Xiangzi’s question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go and show these to Immortal Lady He. Ask her which one she likes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then there was no reply. It seemed like Han Xiangzi went to find Immortal Lady He.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stretched in boredom, and only then did he notice Xia Keke was frowning so much that her face was scrunched up together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened? Did your Aunty Flo come so you’re depressed?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmph.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke swung her arm angrily, but Ye Zichen still saw her peek towards the rings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen laughed softly and called Li Shuang over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He whispered into her ear. Li Shuang nodded, then left once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke occasionally glanced over at Ye Zichen with her large eyes, then back at the rings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This idiot.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke continuously rubbed the corner of her clothes angrily. At this moment, Han Xiangzi also replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great deity, I want to buy, I want to buy…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Xiangzi’s eyes were completely red, when he showed Immortal Lady He the rings earlier, she straightforwardly told him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he would buy it for her, then she would give him a chance!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>A thousand years!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I’ve waited for a thousand years!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pursed his lips and smiled when he felt the urgency in Han Xiangzi’s message, “Which one?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Xiangzi sent him an image, while Ye Zichen took out the ring according to the photo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked at the price…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wow!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Three hundred something thousand!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Great deity, how much cultivation experience will it cost this time?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Since he was going to do it, he had to make it huge.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>There were too many things in the Treasure Shop that Ye Zichen wanted to buy. If he slowly earned cultivation experience, then he wouldn’t even be able to buy anything even if he worked hard for a lifetime.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen made up his mind, squinted his eyes and replied, “Thirty million cultivation experience.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slip.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within the Eight Immortal Mansion, Han Xiangzi’s phone slipped out of his hand.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Thirty million!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Although he was a great deity that had become known for a long time, he truly didn’t have thirty million cultivation experience.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They, the Eight Immortals, were already unlike the great deities in the Heavenly Court, who had worshippers that allowed them to gain cultivation experience without work.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of his were cultivated by him through hard work.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, he couldn’t quite ask his brothers to borrow some cultivation experience either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he must buy the ring for Immortal Lady He’s love.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Xiangzi took a glance at Lü Dongbin, who was practicing sword techniques beside him…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great deity, I can’t afford thirty million cultivation experience!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was shocked. He had thought that deities in the Heavenly Court all had billions of cultivation experience.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn’t afford thirty million.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Business must be done in one go. If Ye Zichen lowered the price here, then wouldn’t it seem like he was screwing Han Xiangzi over?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Ye Zichen didn’t reply for a long time, Han Xiangzi also got anxious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great deity, can we exchange with items?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, sure.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s eyes brightened upon seeing Han Xiangzi’s reply. The only issue was that he didn’t know what treasure Han Xiangzi could take out that matched up to thirty million cultivation experience.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After all, the Fiery Eyes of Truth was only one million cultivation experience.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, even though that was only Level One…</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was still the Great Sage’s treasure!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen didn’t really believe that Han Xiangzi could take out a thirty million treasure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s phone vibrated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A huge red packet appeared on the screen.</span></p>
