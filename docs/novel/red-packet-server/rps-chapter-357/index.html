 <p><span style>Chapter 357 – Press Conference</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen arrived at Maintaining Beauty’s branch office in Qu Qitong’s car, he was completely shocked by the scene in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The size of the branch company was comparable to that of the headquarters. What’s more, the capital was a place where plots of land were absurdly expensive, so the establishment of such a huge branch company on went on to show just how much money Maintaining Beauty Corporation had made in such a short time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop watching like an idiot. You are the owner of Maintaining Beauty. You acting like this will lose face for Yumei,” Qu Qitong smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment, Li Shuang, who was dressed in formal clothing, walked towards them with a smile on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Director Qu, you came!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, I even brought you guys your owner,” Qu Qitong indicated towards Ye Zichen with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon hearing that, a bright smile surfaced on Li Shuang’s face, “Boss!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they arrived within the building, they noticed that the lobby was filled with journalists, while plenty of successful-looking people chit chatted within.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei wore a pale blue ankle length dress and smiled accordingly as she chatted with the people around her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yumei!” Qitong waved her hand. When the people around Xiao Yumei saw her, they all nodded with a smile, then left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did you come?” her words were clearly directed at Ye Zichen. </span><i><span style>Since we haven’t met for a long time, I can’t help but to burn with the fires of passion for her after seeing her again.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What? Can’t I not be here? Much wow, you actually didn’t tell me even though you came to the capital,” Ye Zichen’s words were clearly of a slightly jealous tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei smiled and pursed her lips, then raised her hand to pinch his cheek, “I had wanted to go and find you after finishing all the work to give you a surprise. Who would have thought that Lil’ Tong would actually bring you over.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? So bringing him here is my wrong,” Qu Qitong raised her eyebrows and giggled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two women in front of Ye Zichen definitely had an amazing relationship. </span><i><span style>They clearly weren’t so close before I came to the capital. Just how long has it been and they already seem like good friends of many years…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>As I expected, the feelings between women is not something that men can comprehend…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, why are the women by your side all so pretty!?” Yang Jian bumped Ye Zichen’s shoulder. “If this was in the Heavenly Court, then those animals will definitely explode. We’re good bros, right? Introduce one to me when you have time. It’s alright as long as she’s like them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian’s demand was rather high. Even with what Ye Zichen had seen, there aren’t that many women on the level of Xiao Yumei’s beauty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, so what if he introduced one to Yang Jian?</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t like Yang Jian would be able to stay in the Modern Realm for extended periods of time. Was she supposed to bring the woman back with him when he returns?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if he dared, the girl might be unwilling!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop being an idiot, it’s better for you to look for the large families in the Heavenly Court. If you really feel like the women over there don’t look good without any makeup, then I’ll find time to give them a few makeup lessons…” As Ye Zichen replied, he suddenly stopped. </span><i><span style>Chang’e had said that the skin care products I sent was bad. Then what about cosmetics?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>The Heavenly Court shouldn’t be researched into that, right? When I saw it through Taibai Jinxing’s phone, even the seven fairies faced everyone with their original look.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, what did you say just now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothing, don’t think about the girls in the Modern Realm, go and look for one in the Heavenly Court. When I have time, I’ll definitely help the beauty of the girls in the Heavenly Court reach a new height!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Makeup lessons!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Loving beauty was a woman’s nature, so Ye Zichen could already imagine the level of popularity of the lesson when he starts it.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Perhaps, when I begin the lessons, even people at the level of… the Queen Mother and Avalokiteshvara would join.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Yang Jian raised his eyebrows, “Bro is what you said for real?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>There are no ugly women, only lazy women.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>As long as the women in the Heavenly Court wants to be beautiful, then I can definitely help their beauty reach a new height.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen confidently patted Yang Jian's shoulder and smiled, “When have I ever lied to you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, Director Xiao, the press conference is ready,” at that moment Li Shuang walked over with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing her, Yang Jian bumped Ye Zichen’s shoulder once again, as if he was saying that “this girl is pretty nice too”, causing Ye Zichen to roll his eyes at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Xiao Yumei also nodded with a smile towards Ye Zichen, “Since you came as well, then let’s go together. I’ll give you a chance to counter smack his face!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Me? Counter-smack his face?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows in confusion. He didn’t understand what Xiao Yumei meant at all!</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Qu Qitong giggled, “Why are you so surprised? Aren’t you the owner of this corporation? Why such a huge reaction for attending a mere press conference? Young man… You need training!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qu Qitong’s actions like that of an elder caused Ye Zichen to roll his eyes. However, he still smiled, “Then let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the scene of the press conference, all of the journalists in the room acted as if they were about to face a major enemy as they stood solemnly in the room. All of the people around them were their enemies, but of course…</span></p>
 <p><span style>What they cared about more was their salary.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their questions would only catch the attention of their audience if they asked rather sharp questions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Director Xiao’s here!” Someone shouted out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the cameramen in the room continuously pressed their shutter buttons. It was the first time Ye Zichen experienced anything remotely like that, so he really couldn’t quite accept it in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We have half an hour. Alright, let’s start!” Xiao Yumei sat down in her chair naturally, while Ye Zichen gulped and sat beside her like an obedient child, as he looked dumbly in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Director Xiao, according to my information, Maintaining Beauty Corporation has only been established for forty days. How did you manage to cause it to increase its size so much in such a short amount of time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think this question should be answered by our Director Ye. Let me tell you guys, actually, I’m just an employee. The one beside me is the decision maker of our Maintaining Beauty Corporation!” Xiao Yumei indicate to the position beside her, causing all of the journalists in the room to feel like their heads exploded…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maintaining Beauty Corporation’s CEO Director Xiao is actually just an employee, and she actually had an employer. More importantly, that mysterious employer actually finally appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the hearts of the journalists leaped as they all thought the same in their minds. </span><i><span style>Coming really was the right decision. I actually got some huge news.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Director Ye, you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Director Ye, you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Director Ye, you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All the journalists in the room asked alongside each other, so Ye Zichen could not hear their questions properly at all. At that moment, his brain was completely blank, he never expected Xiao Yumei to just sell him out like that.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I’m just a normal university student. I don’t know how to answer this sort of PR question at all!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei was also a bit nervous. She was doing it for Ye Zichen’s own good because she unintentionally found out something about Ye Zichen’s past.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That person actually dared to smack my little man’s face, so I’ll get my little man to smack his face! I’ll make him regret his decision back then!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>This is just the first step, please don’t fall in front of these veterans.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>That man is watching in front of the television!</span></i></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Original Chapter Teaser:</b>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p><b>Qiu Qitong:&nbsp;</b>Now now, don't look so surprised.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>But... This building...</p>
 <p><strong>Qiu Qitong:&nbsp;</strong>Yeah, it really is impressive. If you just look at the scale of this ceremony, it is extremely hard to imagine that Maintaining Beauty Corporation didn't even exist a few months ago.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Haha, yeah. But honestly, wow...</p>
 <p><strong>Qiu Qitong:&nbsp;</strong>Stop staring like an idiot, no matter what, you should realize that you are the actual owner of all this. So, let's go in and give a surprise to Yumei?</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Yes, yes. Let's go in now. Oh yeah, please stop reading my mind.</p>
 <p><strong>Qiu Qitong:&nbsp;</strong>I said it before didn't I? I'm not reading your mind, it's merely observation skills.</p>
