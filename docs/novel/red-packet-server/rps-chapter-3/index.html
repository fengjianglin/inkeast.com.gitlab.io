 <p><span style>Chapter 3 – Old Lord Taishang’s Great Recovery Pill</span></p>
 <p><span style>Latte Business Club.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen and co. sat in a middle-sized room. The expensive cost of this place was not something that students like them could normally afford. Even though Kang Peng and co. are already trying to save money, the table of food still cost more than fifty thousand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I wonder where Ol’ Three went, he isn’t answering my call either. That brat…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kang Peng shook his head with a sigh. Ol’ Three was called Su Yiyun. He was a rich second-generation, and was the most dissolute person in the dorm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The main reason was that he had a good dad. Every day, he would just skip class and hang out outside. Although he was a rich second-generation, his relationship with the others in the dorm was okay, since he didn’t have that sort of normal young master temper.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His only flaw was that he was stingy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, it could be said that Ye Zichen completely ignored everything around him and merely thought about snatching red packets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You couldn’t help but to say that the speed of people snatching up the various red packets in this deity group was really quick. Quite a few deities had given out red packets already, but he didn’t manage to get anything at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Especially when the fairy maiden that managed the Heavenly Peach Garden gave out red packets. The red packets were the celestial peaches from the Heavenly Peach Garden.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was too slow, so he didn’t get it, causing him to feel silently regretful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just at this moment, Old Lord Taishang, suddenly spoke up in the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang: My celestial friends, how are you doing?</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang: Cough, cough. I saw you guys chatting quite energetically earlier, why did you all start lurking when I appeared? &nbsp;&lt;Insert 3 awkward emoji&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: I, Old Sun, is here, which one of them dares to speak to you? I’m telling you geezer, Old Sun remembers all about you trying to refine Old Sun!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang: Insolent monkey, you are actually still bearing a grudge after so long?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Just ignore that damn monkey.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: My son, did your dog starve to death yet?</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, a flaming contest between deities appeared once again. Upon seeing that, Ye Zichen chuckled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fifth Bro, what are you doing?” Zhu Yunbai went over, ever since they had arrived in the room, Ye Zichen had been playing around with his phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“C’mon, Ol’ Five, since we came to play, can’t you stop messing around with your crappy phone?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The hell do you guys know, laozi is snatching red packets.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of his roommates let out sounds of contempt. </span><i><span style>My god, he already used several tens of thousands, yet he was still snatching red packets.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as the Monkey King and Erlang Shen were flaming each other, a huge red packet suddenly appeared in the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person that had sent it was Old Lord Taishang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen saw it and quickly reacted, immediately snatching it up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Great Recovery Pill x1</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Damn, laozi didn’t get it again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: My son, it’s karma.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just who was the Monkey King? He was an existence that could create several tens of thousands of monkeys by blowing on a few hairs that he plucked off his body. While he was flaming Erlang Shen, several tens of thousands of monkeys could have been holding phones in order to snatch up red packets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These two people had held grudges for several thousand years, both of them were war gods of the celestial realm, so nobody dared to stop them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen didn’t have the time to watch the two of them flame each other. He clicked open the Treasure Chest and saw a black pill lying there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Great Recovery Pill – Old Lord Taishang refined it for fun when he had nothing to do.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk, Old Lord Taishang is too petty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes, but when he saw the effects, he instantly was astonished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Effect: Can save someone from the brink of death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Deities were truly amazing, even something that they refined for fun could save a person’s life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s the most important thing in a person’s life? It’s not money, not power, it was their life!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Without your life, what the hell can you do with money and power.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Had you never heard of those words, the greatest depression in life was that you died without spending all your money.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ol’ Five, stop f*cking snatching it, come and drink a bit with us bros,” Kang Peng also walked over with his wine glass. Thinking that he had gotten enough rewards for the day, and the fact that he came here to play with his brothers, he put his phone away and started drinking cheerfully with his roommates.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After drinking three rounds, they were unable to hold the water in any longer, so they walked towards the toilet together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you guys here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen and co. saw the Ol’ Three in the dorm, Su Yiyun, letting out some water just after they had entered the toilet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*cking hell, laozi was looking for you, and yet you are f*cking hiding here. Are you afraid of us making you pay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kang Peng wrapped his arm around Su Yiyun’s neck, while everyone else also smiled evilly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun scratched his head rather awkwardly. To be truthful, it really was like that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk, I’m telling you, we aren’t going to screw you over, from now on, we have Fifth Bro,” Zhu Yunbai scoffed, just as Su Yiyun was getting curious about why they had came here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing Ol’ Six’s words, Su Yiyun exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ol’ Five, what happened, did you win a lottery?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Something like that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen answered ambiguously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good brat, I never would have thought that you were an amazing person after you cheated food and drinks from us for so long.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After chatting a bit more, Su Yiyun looked at the time and said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, bros, just go and play, I came here with my dad to host some people, I still have to go back to accompany them, so I’ll leave first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“See ya.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone chuckled softly. Just at that moment, a figure frantically ran over from outside the toilet door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He spoke a few words beside Su Yiyun’s ear, causing Su Yiyun’s expression to immediately change. He quickly left them behind with that person, causing Ye Zichen and co. to raise their eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ol’ Three ran into some trouble, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How about we go and have a look?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s not, he’s hosting, what would it be like if we went over?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But something seems to have happened over at Third Bro’s place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ol’ Five, what do you think?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone set their gazes on Ye Zichen. At this moment, he became everyone’s decision maker.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go and have a look.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you bring Commissioner Liu’s cardiac medications?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The room was in a complete mess, with the man sitting in the very middle showing the face of suffering.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nope.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then call the ambulance quickly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Ye Zichen and co. also appeared in the room. Seeing that, a man, who looked pretty much identity to Si Yiyun, asked with a frown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dad, these are my classmates.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun was also completely confused, he quickly walked over to Ye Zichen and co.’s side and said with his eyebrows raised.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did you guys show up?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I felt like you ran into trouble just now, so we came to have a look.” Kang Peng frowned, then said while raising his eyebrows towards the man on the sofa, “What’s the situation?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Commissioner Liu had a heart attack, but we didn’t bring any medication. We were just about to call the ambulance. Don’t stay here, if something really happens, that’ll drag you guys into it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun pushed them out towards the door forcefully. At the same time, Ye Zichen’s expression moved slightly as he touched his phone in his pocket.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that the person on the sofa was more or less dead, Ye Zichen thought to himself, </span><i><span style>it should be fine if I use the Great Recovery Pill, right?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He quietly moved off to the side, then clicked on Treasure Chest in his WeChat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Great Recovery pill was still lying calmly in the Treasure Chest. Ye Zichen had already wanted to use this Great Recovery Pill to save a life, but when he was truly about to withdraw it, he hesitated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was just something could only be gotten by chance, if he sold it, wouldn’t he be able to get an astronomical amount for it?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damn, something’s going to happen to my bro, and I’m still thinking about money...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He clenched his teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Withdraw Great Recovery Pill x1.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An exquisite jade bottle appeared in Ye Zichen’s hands.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck, it really got withdrawn.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>When he opened the bottle, the faint smell of the pill rushed into his nostrils. However, with but a smell of the aroma, Ye Zichen already felt like he was really refreshed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This product of Old Lord Taishang was truly exceptional.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen held the jade bottle in his hands and ran over quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait a moment, I can save Commissioner Liu’s life.”</span></p>
