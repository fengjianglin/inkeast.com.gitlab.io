 <p><span style>“Do you feel like it</span><i><span style> isn’t</span></i><span style> messed up enough yet?” Ye Zichen laughed mockingly with a speechless shrug when he heard the white-robed man’s words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The chat group had already made everything very clear. The Jade Emperor had been watching the situation with the Immortal Region and Underworld the entire time, and was going to launch a surprise attack to catch them off-guard.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wouldn’t it get even more messed up with the Heavenly Court people down here?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you have no faith in your rally? Do you think that I told you to increase your intimacy level with them for nothing?” the white-robed man pursed his lips with a smile. “Ignoring the others. Let’s just talk about Yang Jian… Who do you think he’ll choose between you and the Jade Emperor?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just what are you planning?” Ye Zichen frowned. </span><i><span style>From the sound of his words, it sounds like he told me to increase my intimacy level with the Heavenly Court deities because he knew this would happen.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Everything I planned is for the Three Realms,” the white-robed man sighed softly. “Go and get Yang Jian and co. We’ll need their strength to deal with the demon elites.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at the white-robed man for a while, but the damn mosaiced ‘screen’ completely covered the latter’s face, so he couldn’t get anything from the man’s expression at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pondered for a moment, then chose to believe in the man….</span></p>
 <p><span style>He took out his phone from his pocket, opened the chatting app and entered the private group Yang Jian and the others created.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Old Yang, I can’t stand the pressure anymore, I’m moving out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Fortune: I gave out the funds too.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang: I already handed out the supplies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Do you guys really want to attack the Immortal Region and the Underworld? The Jade Emperor’s being a fool, but don’t you guys see what’s going to happen?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: If we attack now, then what’ll we do if the demons come?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: We won’t be able to stand it with dangers facing us on both ends.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: The Jade Emperor just asked me if I can lead a hundred thousand soldiers as well...</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: He probably went to talk to everyone who can lead an army in the Heavenly Court. It looks like he’s determined to fight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Damnit!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King Li: I’m not sure if you guys know, but the Great Sage has been organizing the Endless Beast Region to mobilize their army. But, he didn’t say why he was doing that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: What the heck is the monkey joining in for? I’m going to go insane!</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Old Yang, this isn’t a situation when you can refuse to mobilize the army just because you don’t want to. If you don’t mobilize your army, then the Jade Emperor will just strip you of your command and go to find someone else. Since that’s the case, we might as well lead our armies out ourselves. At least we will consider about our bonds, and we can mobilize our army without actually fighting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Fortune: I wonder where is Sky Sovereign. If he comes out now and holds out the Jade Emperor’s token…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King Li: Sigh…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The group was filled with complaints. It seems like the Jade Emperor pressured them some more, and urged them to mobilize their armies to attack the Immortal Region and the Underworld.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen frowned, then looked up at the white-robed man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What should I tell them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tell them to move out, then station outside Maple City,” the white-robed man replied calmly. “But remind them not to do anything to the normal people in the Immortal Region’s outer region. Tell them to stay there for now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then we’ll wait for the demon elites fall into our trap.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen took a deep breath, then nodded before sending a message in the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Ye Zichen sent the message, the chat stopped moving for approximately thirty seconds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was clear that his sudden reappearance shocked all the deities.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Fortune: Sky Sovereign!</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Am I seeing things? That was by Sky Sovereign, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang: The one in charge is finally here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King Li: Sky Sovereign, you know what’s going on in the Three Realms now, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: Good, good.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Bro, wow. Where did you disappear off to for so long? We’ve been so anxious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I went to a sealed off place recently, and only just managed to get free,” Ye Zichen typed. “I know more or less about what’s going on with the Immortal Region and the Underworld. Someone tell me what’s going on with the Heavenly Court?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang: Jade Emperor’s being an idiot, and is determined to knock down the Underworld and the Immortal Region.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Recently, I’ve gotten like seven orders for me to mobilize my army per day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: We’ve been having meetings at the Cloudy Palace of the Golden Arches essentially every day. Everything we’ve been discussing is how we can take over the Immortal Region and the Underworld.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King Li: Due to the Jade Emperor being so determined, the Queen Mother got into a fight with him, so she quit the management of the Heavenly Court. Now, the Jade Emperor is the sole leader.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha: Hehe, Sky Sovereign is back. I found out from Immortality Peach-jiejie that the Queen Mother is very angry at the Jade Emperor. She even officially messaged the Four Direction Emperors to impeach the Jade Emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was shocked. </span><i><span style>I didn’t expect so much to have happened with the Heavenly Court just because of the Underworld and Immortal Region.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I didn’t expect the Queen Mother and Jade Emperor to essentially get into such a huge fight.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: No wonder the Jade Emperor’s anxious. So the Queen Mother actually wants to get him impeached. I guess he wants to take over the Underworld and Immortal Region as quick as possible so that his position is safe even if the Four Direction Emperors come over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Focus on the main issue! We shouldn’t think about whether the Jade Emperor’s getting impeached or not. Now that my bro’s here, do we mobilize our armies or…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King Li: Yes, yes, yes. That’s the proper issue at hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Sky Sovereign, what do you think? Do we move out against the Immortal Region and the Underworld?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen glanced at the white-robed man and saw that the latter was looking back at him. When the white-robed man noticed Ye Zichen’s glance, he nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tell them to come. We’ll rely on these warriors to deal with the demon elites.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen gritted his teeth, then typed out his reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Move out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: …</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Fortune: …</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Bro, you’re kidding, right? You want us to attack the Immortal Region and Underworld as well?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course not,” Ye Zichen squinted his eyes. “I want you guys to come to fight the demons.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Inside the wormhole…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The demons were closer and closer to the outer regions of the Immoral Region after several days of sleepless voyage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lord Black Dragon, we’ll be arriving outside the Immortal Region’s Pool City soon,” the bald demon sovereign walked over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon suddenly opened his closed eyes, and a sharp light shot out, “Finally?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He smirked, while his body trembled in excitement, “It’s been several thousand years. I’ve waited several thousand years for this chance. The day has finally come!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Our elites have all moved out. The Three Realms is in chaos right now with the Immortal Region, Underworld and Heavenly Court locked in an endless fight. We will definitely be able to take over the Three Realms and leave a glorious achievement in your history, sire!” the bald demon sovereign replied in excitement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The smile on Black Dragon grew even more apparent. “Well said. After this war, the Immortal Region, Underworld and Heavenly Court will be history. Only the Demon Realm’s glory will last forever. Warriors, get ready. Attack!”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Original Chapter Teaser:</strong>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>What the hell is he planning!? He wants to drag Yang Jian and the Heavenly Court deities in? Are you kidding me?</p>
 <p>This is war. WAR. How can he not understand what this means?</p>
 <p>What's more, these are my friends. I can't possibly go and tell them to fight each other! They'll get hurt! And he seems to be planning some sort of way to screw the demons over?&nbsp;That's not working unless the war is real, and it looks like it is now!&nbsp;Even the Jade Emperor can see that it is getting intense. That's why he wants to take this opportunity to take over the Underworld and the Immortal Region!</p>
 <p>Ugh, just what is this man thinking!? Since he was here, he&nbsp;should have just cleared up any and all speculations about me being dead or something. It's not like he doesn't know where I am, or if I'm alive. He knew all that. He should have stopped the war! Not try and make things even more chaotic!</p>
