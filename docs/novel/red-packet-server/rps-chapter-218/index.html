 <p><span style>Chapter 218 – Died</span></p>
 <p><span style>The glasses-wearing young man spoke like it was the truth, and his body language along with his shimmering gaze emphasized that even more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are f*cking insane,” Ye Zichen cursed loudly.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is this brat retarded? He immediately told me that I died before. Did his brain get fried or something?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>He was lucky if he didn’t get beaten to death since no one else heard it.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Who’s insane? I clearly saw that when you went bungee jumping in Extreme Park, the rope snapped, and you fell into the lake!” the young man in glasses cursed at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was stunned upon hearing that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked at the glasses-wearing young man in surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the young man saw that Ye Zichen did not reply immediately, he freaked out so much that his entire face turned stark white, “You really are a ghost… Wait, aren’t ghosts scared of like? Oh yeah, cross, my cross.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, the young man in glasses actually took out a cross that was several centimeters long and prodded Ye Zichen with it repeatedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You escaped from Azure Dragon Mental Institution, right?” Ye Zichen revealed a speechless expression as he looked at the young man outside with his hands on his hips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a long time, when the young man saw that the silver cross didn’t do any actual damage to Ye Zichen, he couldn’t help but yelp, “You really aren’t a ghost!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How could laozi be a ghost? Have you seen any ghost with a face as nourished as mine?” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This caused the young man to eye Ye Zichen vigilantly a few times.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He really doesn’t seem like a ghost.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry, I don’t know what happened to me recently, I always have some weird dreams. When I go outside, I would see a lot of weird things, so…” The glasses-wearing young man stuttered out an explanation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen let out a sigh, then looked at the young man, “What did you come here for…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Buzz!</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the phone in his pocket rang, Ye Zichen looked at the caller ID, then subconsciously looked towards the window of the mansion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Wan stood by the window and indicated for him to pick up the call before placing the phone by her ear…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can you make the person outside leave?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did he do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He…” Jing Wan told him about what happened during her stream. After hearing that, Ye Zichen made a hand gesture that told her not to worry before putting his phone back into his pocket.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brat, what did you come here for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m looking for Jing Wan!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The glasses young man’s face instantly lit up with excitement. During Jing Wan’s stream, she had accidentally revealed her location…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, he used his otaku computing skills to find out the exact place!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Due to his excitement, he immediately hurried over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jing Wan?” Ye Zichen revealed a confused look. “Who’s Jing Wan? This is my home, you got the wrong place!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Impossible, Jing Wan is here!” The glasses young man said determinedly. He had checked the IP and it was this place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little bro, don’t act crazy with me,” Ye Zichen squinted his eyes. “I didn’t even want to care that you said such unlucky things to me earlier. If you act crazy with me, I’m going to hit you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jing Wan is right here! Don’t try to trick me, Jing Wan called you just now, right? What’s your relationship with Jing Wan? Goddess is actually living with a man…” The glasses young man’s face was bright red. If a look could kill, Ye Zichen would have died several times already.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? I said Jing Wan isn’t here. This is my home, can you stop messing around? Otherwise, I’m going to call the police!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How are you supposed to prove that!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“… Madman.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes. At this moment, a white poodle walked by the gate of the base as he lead a bunch of subordinates, as if it was a supervisor surveying the place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment it saw Ye Zichen, the poodle immediately ran over with its tongue out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he saw Lil’ White, Ye Zichen’s eyes also lit up…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ White, bite him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Yi and Di Xinpeng’s solo competition ended with a draw. Since she was able to gain another strong player, Jing Wan smiled so much that her eyes turned into crescent moons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Welcome to our large family.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After getting the contract signed, Jing Wan reached out her hand with a smile. Huang Yi stood at the side blankly and was hesitant in reaching his hand over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why?</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the number one gaming streamer, Jing Wan had a huge reputation and fanbase.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Yi was one of her fans.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t hard to understand the emotions in his heart when he found out that the owner of the team was actually the idol, whose stream he had watched for several years.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that Jing Wan seemed in a rather awkward situation with her hand held out, Ye Zichen rolled his eyes speechlessly, “What are you blanking out for? Isn’t it just a handshake…?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Ye Zichen reached his hand over without thinking, “This kid’s shy, so I’ll just shake hands for him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Wan smiled, then looked at Ye Zichen, who had a bright smile on his face, with a complicated gaze.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This man had criticized my dreams over and over again.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Yet, he helped me realize it over and over again.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A weird emotion that she never felt before began to grew as if she took some catalyst.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a long while, when she finally suppressed the strange feelings in her heart, she laughed using a normal tone, “Are you sure you don’t want a place in the team? With you here, the championship is within our sights.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Never mind, you should clearly know that my ambition is not here,” Ye Zichen shrugged with a smile, then looked at the blushing Huang Yi. “I’ll leave my little bro with you, you have to treat him well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course!” Jing Wan replied without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded, then said a few more words to Huang Yi before looking at the team, “Since you now have enough people for your team, I, who’s unneeded, will stop disturbing your team’s training. Also, I have something to say to you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen glanced at Jing Wan, “Be more careful when you stream from now on. Or you should just hire a few bodyguards, I feel like that brat might come by again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know, that was indeed my negligence. I’ll apologize to my fans the next time I stream.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then… That’s it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After saying farewell, Ye Zichen left the mansion. The moment he walked out of the gate, he saw Lil’ White waiting for him there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite Lil’ White looking like a poodle, when you talked about ferocity…</span></p>
 <p><span style>This little guy was very ferocious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just moments earlier, this little guy chased the glasses-wearing young man for several blocks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the moment it saw Ye Zichen, Lil’ White ran over with a flattering look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, the moment Lil’ White neared him, a hint of solemnity appeared in the little dog’s eyes as he scanned Ye Zichen’s body with a flash of green light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck, watch it what you’re doing when you’re outside,” Ye Zichen hurriedly looked around. If this was f*cking seen by outsiders, both he and Lil’ White would be captured for experiments.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows in confusion. The distressed tone did not sound like the Lil’ White he knew.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ White looked at him with a somber expression, and this stare caused Ye Zichen to feel very uncomfortable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? What do you want to say?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a long while, Lil’ White finally looked up and stared straight into Ye Zichen’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You… died before.”</span></p>
 <p></p>

 <p><b>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</b>The heck are you on about?</p>
 <p><b>Suspicious Dude:&nbsp;</b>It can't be... I saw you die! Wait...</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Dude, it's not cool to go up to someone and ask them if they died. It's a very unlucky thing to say!</p>
 <p><b>Suspicious Dude:&nbsp;</b>You went to Extreme Park for bungee jumping didn't you! I saw you jump, and then the rope snapped!</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>... I didn't even jump. Wait... How did you know about all this!?</p>
