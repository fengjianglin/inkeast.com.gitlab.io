 <p><span style>Chapter 468 – Su Yan’s News</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>How’s this possible? How did Su Yan send me a message?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen quickly clicked on his chat with her and took a look at the time that the message was sent.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It was just ten minutes ago…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s heart suddenly to beat intensely. </span><i><span style>Could it be that after the Modern Realm was frozen, Su Yan was also excluded out, causing her to ascend to the Modern Realm?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Su Yan?” Ye Zichen replied in a testing manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Ye Zichen sent the message, Su Yan directly responded with a video call invitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gulp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen gulped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Accept.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It really is you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within the video, Su Yan covered her mouth with her hands, while tears could be seen in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen also froze when he saw that the person in the video was truly Su Yan…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…” Ye Zichen stared at the video blankly, but was unable to form a sentence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Su Yan spoke up, “Keke told me that you would definitely reply if I sent you a message. I didn’t actually believe her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is Keke with you?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows in his confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan moved to the side a little in the video, then Xia Keke appeared and waved towards him, “Hey, Zichen-ge!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s going on?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why are the two of them together?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you two still in the Modern Realm?” Ye Zichen asked in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan shook her head, while Xia Keke replied, “How is that possible? Hasn’t the Modern Realm been frozen? Susu and I were kicked out as well. We’re in the Three Realms right now. Zichen-ge is in the Three Realms as well, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, yeah…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s amazing. It seems like we’ll have a chance to meet. Susu are I are at the southern part of the Endless Beast Region, over at the dragons’ and the nine-tail foxes’ land. Zichen-ge, are you far away from the two of us? If you’re not, then come over?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Endless Beast Region.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked to the side in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xuan-Yuan Xiang immediately came out of his arm and raised her eyebrows, “You’re in at the northern part of the Immortal Region as well. You’re miles away from the Endless Beast Region. If you want to go over… Then it’ll be hard with your current strength!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, Zichen-ge… Is the signal bad? Why aren’t you speaking?” Xia Keke continuously waved in the video.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately repeated Xuan-Yuan Xiang’s words to her…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan’s expression instantly turned sadder, while Xia Keke shrugged helplessly, “True, Zichen-ge is of the human race, right? Then alright, wait until Susu and I become strong enough to come over and find you!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Human race?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I know that Xia Keke is of the dragon race, but shouldn’t Su Yan…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Third Young Lady, the medical bath has been prepared, do you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, a white clothed girl with two pointy ears on her head appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing her, Su Yan nodded quietly, then waved towards Ye Zichen, “I’ll talk to you later.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Xia Keke also nodded with a giggle, “Bye bye, Zichen-ge.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pa.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the video ended, Su Yan reluctantly put her phone to the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Keke grabbed her hand with a smile, “Don’t be like that. At least we know Zichen-gege is in the Three Realms as well. Isn’t that great?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm, you’re right,” Su Yan smiled warmly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pointy-eared woman immediately asked, “Lady Xia, do you want us to prepare a medical bath for you as well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Xia Keke immediately shook her head like a rattle drum, “No need for me. I can’t enjoy the nine-tail foxes’ medical bath.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, she stood up from her chair, “Susu, come play at my place when you finish.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay,” Su Yan nodded with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pointy-ear woman spoke up once again, “Third Young Lady…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, I get it. Bring me over!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Back at the pavilion, Ye Zichen’s heart was filled with shock, but he was also overwhelmed with joy.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Both Su Yan and Xia Keke are safe and in the Three Realms. It seems like I have to raise my strength as quick as possible, then strengthen my forces, and meet up with them as soon as possible.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Little fellow, don’t think so far ahead. The Beast Region’s relationship with the human race is not actually that good. If you go… Hehe!” Xuan-Yuan Xiang immediately dampened Ye Zichen’s enthusiasm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked up, “Why do you always discourage me? Give me some confidence, alright?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, like this?” Xuan-Yuan Xiang nodded understandingly as her expression changed. “Oh, my master. You are the strongest and the most amazing man in the world… The Endless Beast Region is nothing, if you want, then the entirety of the Three Realms will be in your grasp…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop!” Ye Zichen hurriedly stopped her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xuan-Yuan Xiang pouted unhappily, “Why aren’t you letting me continue? Don’t you like me giving you confidence?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, there’s no need,” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes at her, then begun to call out to the old Dragon God in his sea of consciousness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since he has already found out about Su Yan and Xia Keke’s location, then he had to hurry over as soon as possible…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Never mind letting them come over to find me. As a man, how can I let my women run around unprotected?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Three days passed in the blink of an eye. During the three days, Ye Zichen repeatedly tried to break through to the Human Immortal level, but he always met with failure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After failure once again, Ye Zichen opened his eyes helplessly, then looked back and saw that the old Dragon God was looking at him with a helpless expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t look at me like that. I have no way to help you. You could have broken through into the Human Immortal level, but… You gave up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The situation was dire last time,” Ye Zichen sighed softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The old Dragon God nodded, “It might have been dire, but it is true that you can’t break through into the Human Immortal level right now. You should have felt it already, every single time you fail, the next attempt only becomes more difficult.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That is true,” Ye Zichen nodded. “Am I supposed to stay at the complete stage of the Earth Immortal level for my entire life?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not really,” the old Dragon God shook his head. “Haven’t you already arrived in the Three Realms? There is a herb called the Barrier Breaking Grass, which can be used to refine a Barrier Breaking Pill. That pill is only usable by those underneath the Immortal King level. After taking the pill, they will be able to directly breakthrough without any trouble. However, every person can only take one in their entire lifetime. Normally speaking, people would only take it when breaking through from the Human Immortal level to the Sky Immortal level. Right now… In this situation, I feel like you can try this pill.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Barrier Breaking Pill!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen suddenly smiled. </span><i><span style>If we’re talking about pills, then I have…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you talking about the Barrier Breaking Pill? Old Lord Taishang replied to Ye Zichen on his phone. “I could have given it to you if you had come to find me a few days earlier. My last Barrier Breaking Pill has already been taken away by that shitty brat, Yang Jian.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can’t you refine anymore?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can, but I do need the materials. The Heavenly Court doesn’t have any Barrier Breaking Grass, and I only got the last batch by coincidence when I went around the lower realm.” Old Lord Taishang replied. “If you need the pill, then you can find some Barrier Breaking Grass for me to help you refine it. Otherwise, go and ask Yang Jian for it. Don’t you two have a good relationship?”</span></p>

 <p></p>
 <p>Sigh...</p>
 <p>I've finally settled down nicely in the village with good people, and a nice place to live, but... what about those around me?</p>
 <p>Off the top of my head... Mom, Xia Keke, Gou Yuzhan... Where are you guys? How are you doing? I suppose Xia Keke's going to be with her race, so she should be fine, but what about mom? Where did she go off to?</p>
 <p>Also, how about lollipop kid? His personality seriously worries me.</p>
 <p>Then there's also Wei Chen and Taibai... But I guess they should be fine. Wei Chen's the Body Double of the White Tiger after all, and Taibai Jinxing is from around here.</p>
 <p>Gah. Old Man Lin... Just what did you mean that everything would rest on my shoulders? Do I have to completely exterminate the demon race in order to unfreeze the Modern Realm?</p>
 <p>Wait, someone's sent me a message on my phone?</p>
 <p>Huh? How could this be...? Su Yan..?</p>
