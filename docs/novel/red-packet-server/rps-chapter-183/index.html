 <p><span style>Chapter 183 – Spiritual Body! False Spiritual Body!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huo Da’s expression tensed when he saw Ye Zichen’s fist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yu!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Yu also reacted, and grabbed towards Ye Zichen’s arm with a murderous light in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he was a step too late.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen punched Huo Da on his nose, causing streams of red to flow down from his nostrils. From the looks of his collapsed nasal bridge, it seemed like Ye Zichen managed to break his nose.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Die.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A murderous light flashed in Yu’s eyes. There had never been anyone that could attack the person he wanted to protect in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen actually hit his employer in front of him…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu’s hands shone with a faint light as he smashed towards Ye Zichen’s head with an oppressive aura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s pupils contracted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He quickly activated Unbreakable Body and lifted his arms high up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A huge impact soared through his arms…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The soft crack was extremely ear-piercing in that very moment. Ye Zichen frowned, then retracted his arm without any expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, the shop’s security guards surrounded Yu and Huo Da!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do what you should be doing, no need to mind this,” Ye Zichen roared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The security guards were stunned for a moment. Although they didn’t understand, they didn’t dare to just recklessly move forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen looked up at Yu once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Similarly, the other person was looking at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Spiritual Body.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“False Spiritual Body!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen and Yu spoke up at the same time. When he heard the other person’s words, both of their pupils contracted.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck my life.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Laozi’s screwed this time.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen cursed in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the hell is going on recently? Why do I always bump into people from that place…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Kill him, kill him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huo Da, who’s nose continuously bled as he laid on the floor, yelled. At the same time, Ye Zichen also gulped.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Laozi can’t beat him.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen did not expect...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go by the rules!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu looked faintly towards Ye Zichen, then helped Huo Da up from the ground and led him out, while ignoring Huo Da’s mad cursing after he said that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within the VIP room of the jewelry shop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sat down on the sofa with a frown, while his arms dangled by his side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei said worriedly, “Zichen, let’s go to the hospital.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Before that, shouldn’t you tell me just who the hell is that Huo Da?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Feelings arose from Xiao Yumei’s eyes once again as Huo Da was mentioned, “He had once pursued me in high school. During the third year of high school, he suddenly told me that he would leave for a while and promised that he would come back for me. However, nearly ten years had passed. I had thought that he wouldn’t return, I…”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So he’s her first love!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It seemed like that brat wasn’t just a normal bastard!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s more, from Xiao Yumei’s gaze back then…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Yumei, you can’t still have feelings for him, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you saying!” A hint of anger surfaced on Xiao Yumei’s face. “I already have you now, how can I still have feelings for him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then just now…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was just a bit surprised and couldn’t react in time. The next time he comes, I’ll definitely reject him!” Xiao Yumei answered with certainty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did Ye Zichen smile in satisfaction, “I knew that you’re the best.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded. However, Yu’s appearance suddenly surfaced in his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What came with it was Yu’s words right before he left.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Go by the rules… What rules did he want to go by!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei said worriedly when she saw Ye Zichen’s worrying expression, “Zichen, did I cause some trouble for you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How could that be? Nothing you do can actually become trouble in my eyes,” Ye Zichen smiled unrestrainedly, then tried to raise his hand to caress Xiao Yumei’s hair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rip.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei opened her mouth wide, then looked down and saw Ye Zichen’s arm swell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, let’s go to the hospital.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need,” Ye Zichen shook his head, then opened the Treasure Shop on his phone’s WeChat as he endured the tearing pain from his arm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was fortunate that healing pills were the most common thing within the Treasure Shop. However, the price was extremely expensive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A single level one healing pill required a hundred cultivation experience, it ripped him off even more than the geezer Old Lord Taishang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen was not the Ye Zichen from back then.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had several hundred thousand cultivation experience on hand, the hundred didn’t matter to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After buying one, he withdrew it from the Treasure Chest, then popped the pill into his mouth, while he chucked the jade bottle used to hold the pill to the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, he felt a stream of warmth flow through his meridians, while his swollen and painful arms began to return to normal.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just what is the strength of that person?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen wondered to himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen crossed blows with him just now, he could feel that Yu wasn’t simple.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With Ye Zichen’s False Spiritual Body strengthened by Unbreakable Body, he couldn’t have possibly lost even if he was facing a normal martial artist!</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the other person had easily dispelled his attack, and shocked his arms to the point of causing them to be fractured.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He could be sure that the other person was of the Spiritual Body level, but he was unsure of what stage of the Spiritual Body level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei’s expression carried a hint of worry, alongside a surprise that she was unable to hide.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She saw it just now, she saw everything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She saw a pill suddenly appear in Ye Zichen’s hand, and after he chucked it into his mouth, the injury on his arms immediately improved for the better…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You saw it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen could approximately guess what it was from Xiao Yumei’s expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There would be a day when his secrets come to light, especially in front of his women.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thinking that, since he felt like it would be known sooner or later, Ye Zichen decided to come clean with her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yumei, let me tell you something. You can’t tell others.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, say it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei nodded seriously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen spoke about his situation for an entire ten-odd minutes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for Xiao Yumei…</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was instantly stunned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you want to say?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I… You… Deities… How is that possible!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t believe me, right? But this is all real,” Ye Zichen shrugged helplessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In comparison, Xiao Yumei’s reaction was something Ye Zichen found more reasonable. When he thought back to Xia Keke’s reaction…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He could only say that the child was too insensitive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei looked at him blankly for a long time…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let me calm down a bit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was an atheist, she had never believed in ghosts or gods.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen was the man she trusted most, for him to tell her in person that…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He was dealing with deities.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Was she dreaming?</span></p>
 <p><span style>She reached out and pinched Ye Zichen, who was sitting beside her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you doing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Does it hurt?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei asked with her eyes wide open.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How could it not!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei had used all the strength in her body to pinch him, and it was at his waist…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>How could it not hurt!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not dreaming,” Xiao Yumei muttered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, if you want to see if you’re dreaming or not, can’t you just pinch yourself!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What if it’s painful? I’m terrified of pain,” Xiao Yumei rolled her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>She was too unreasonable…</span></i></p>
