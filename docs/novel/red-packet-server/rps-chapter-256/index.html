 <p><span style>Chapter 256 – Half-Beastmen</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both girls looked at Mu Chuang nervously. There was no helping it, their fates were going to be determined by a single sentence from him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen-ge, let’s go back,” Mu Chuang looked over the girl in purple and laughed softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded in satisfaction after hearing his reply, “Are you sure?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm,” Mu Chuang nodded in confirmation, stood up from the chair and walked next to the purple-shirted girl to take down the ribbon in her hair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He smiled as her long hair flowed down and snagged the ribbon, “Give it to me as a souvenir. There’ll be a day that I make you look up to me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>During this entire time, Ye Zichen maintained a faint smile. He wasn’t that much of a scum to allow Mu Chuang to forcefully take the girl. If Mu Chuang chose to have the two girls accompany him…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he definitely would get beaten up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the heated gaze in Mu Chuang’s eyes, Ye Zichen could tell that the lesson as rather successful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Ye Zichen left the clubhouse with Mu Chuang as the clubhouse’s supervisor and manager bid them farewell alongside a large group of other people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen-ge, I want to work for you,” Mu Chuang looked up determinedly the moment they left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s fine, but don’t think that you can directly be a high leveled worker. If you do choose to work for me, you have to start from the bottom,” Ye Zichen replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chuang maintained his determined gaze, “No problem.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled, he was rather pleased that he managed to redirect his little brother onto the right path.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen patted Mu Chuang’s shoulders in recognition, when a dangerous feeling suddenly surrounded him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen reached out his hand to stop a taxi, pushed Mu Chuang into the car and chucked three hundred yuan at the driver.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll deal with your work issue tomorrow. Take the cab back first, then tell Jinglei-jie and my mom that I have some stuff that’ll delay me for a while.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, he closed the door without waiting for a reply and watched the taxi leave. Only then did he let out a long sigh and took out a cigarette for himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come out!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hssss…</span></p>
 <p><span style>A spandex-wearing man walked out from the dark and gazed at Ye Zichen with snake-like eyes, causing the latter to feel uneasy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was especially true since Ye Zichen could feel a dense bloodlust from him…</span></p>
 <p><span style>­Huuu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen released a mouthful of smoke and eyed the clubhouse behind him, then back at the man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Han Yu told you to come, right? But he’s in too much of a hurry, I haven’t even left the surroundings of his clubhouse yet. Is he not afraid of the blame of this falling on him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ta ta ta…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man slowly walked towards Ye Zichen in silence. The closer he got to Ye Zichen, the more intense the thick smell of blood became.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Seriously…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen chucked his cigarette onto the ground and stomped it out…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since the Hou brothers did not come out to guard him, it is possible that they weren’t nearby, so he could only rely on himself.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Since his strength was unknown, I might as well take initiative and attack him for a bit…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen punched his arm, but Ye Zichen did not expect the other person’s reaction speed to be so fast…</span></p>
 <p><span style>A ray of cold slight flashed across Ye Zichen’s face, while he dropped down and kicked the man.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>He isn’t very easy to deal with.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Tiger Fist!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A huge illusion of a tiger head attacked from the side, shocking Ye Zichen with it’s aura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person that dashed towards Ye Zichen stopped, then leaned to the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck, I missed!” An angry voice shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, Ye Zichen saw the buzz cut young man, who kept on asking him for a duel, walk out from the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The spandex-wearing man merely paused slightly before he continued to charge over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck, the heck are you blanking out for!? Run!” The buzz cut young man grabbed Ye Zichen by his shoulder and ran backwards. The spandex-wearing man wanted to chase, but a rock suddenly fell down from the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immediately afterwards, Wei Chen stretched lazily, and blocked off the path of the spandex-wearing man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Ye, hurry up and run, leave this place to me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…” Ye Zichen revealed a worried expression. From his brief fight with the spandex-wearing man earlier, he was able to feel the strength of the other person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You what? My dad’s definitely alright. Where’s your car, hurry up and run!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Under Wei Chen and the buzz cut young man’s continuous urging, Ye Zichen clenched his teeth and drove away. Meanwhile, the spandex-wearing man wanted to follow as he saw the SUV leave, but Wei Chen blocked him off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m here, and you still want to chase?” With that, Wei Chen took out a cigarette from a box, held it in his mouth and lit it. “Half-beastman, I’ll give you a cigarette of time. I hope you can satisfy me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sat in the front seat and looked at the excited young man with a buzz cut, “I still don’t know what you’re called!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wei Teng!” Wei Teng licked his lips and stared intently in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This name…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at him speechlessly. </span><i><span style>There really wasn’t much thought put into it.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Although Ye Zichen clearly knew that the “Teng” wasn’t the Teng meaning hurt or ache, he still felt like there was a large chance that…</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>Wei Chen might have had a stomachache when he named Wei Teng<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>.</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen did not comment on Wei Teng’s name, “Is it really alright to leave your dad there?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What issues could there be? I’m telling you, my dad is really amazing,” Wei Teng said in admiration.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thinking about the strength of Wei Teng’s Tiger Fist, Ye Zichen did realize that Wei Chen shouldn’t be too weak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did the two of you come over to save me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How would I know!” Wei Teng turned his head and rolled his eyes at Ye Zichen. “My dad was intent on coming here, can I, as the son, stop him!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck, can you drive properly!?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Does this guy not care about his life!? He dared to just look around even though he’s driving!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh yeah, I forgot!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wei Chen scratched his head with a smile, causing both of his hands to leave the wheel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen opened his eyes wide, then looked at the way he was driving…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have you driven before?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve driven tractors with my dad back in the village!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The more Ye Zichen asked, the more uneasy he felt. However, he still asked hopefully, “Do you have a driving license?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You need a driving license to drive this?” Wei Teng replied, shocked. “Grab on, we’re going downhill!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Eventually, Ye Zichen was able to return to the mansion safely. </span><i><span style>If you had a heart attack or something, you might have to go straight to the emergency room in the middle of the journey if you let Wei Teng drive..</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen got out in his fatigue, then puked on the side of the road.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you alright? You get carsick even though you have a car?” Wei Teng walked over and looked at Ye Zichen’s mansion. “Zeze, the place you live in isn’t bad. Oh yeah, find a time to compete with me, but you have to give me ten minutes time to prepare…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No way!” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes furiously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wei Teng threw the car keys back into Ye Zichen’s hands, then patted the SUV reluctantly, “It really is nice. This feels so much better than driving a tractor. Here’s your car keys. If you need a driver, then call me any time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he left casually.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Ye Zichen, who was holding the car keys, couldn’t help but retort.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>No one wants you as the driver!</span></i></p>
