 <p><span style>Chapter 76 – Harming the bystanders</span></p>
 <p><span style>The abandoned factory in the city east was…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Worn down, wasted…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Filled with weeds!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Ye Zichen got out of the taxi, he stood in front of the old factory and dialed that unknown number.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m here, where are you guys?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn’t expect you to be so quick. Come straight in, you’ll see us then.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Creak…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pushed open the old metallic door, causing a sharp sound to pass into his ears and nose-piercing wetness to rush towards his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The light passed through the entrance and shone inside…</span></p>
 <p><span style>A long-haired man, wearing rivet pants, with a row of earholes on his right ear sat right in front of the entrance. He was smoking with his legs crossed. When he saw Ye Zichen, he threw the cigarette onto the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You came?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where are my roommates?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen frowned. The man clapped his hands and saw two men bringing Bai Yu and Kang Peng out from a dark corner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two of them were covered in blood and barely alive as their heads drooped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Click.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Ye Zichen raised his fist, dark barrels had already been pointed at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t be so impulsive. Otherwise, you’ll be in danger.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man waved his hands towards his subordinates, causing the people to instantly put away their guns.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let my friends go, the person you’re looking for is me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen remained silent as he stared at the man with his eyes. However, he had been silently communicating with Liu Qing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, the man raised his eyebrows. He lit a cigarette for himself with a smile and exhaled a bit of smoke towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can release your friends, but I have to see you dead before then. I have a habit of letting the dead speak their last words, you won’t be an exception.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to know who hired you to kill me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked straight at the man, but still paid attention to Liu Qing’s situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m very sorry about this, but we can’t say it,” the man chuckled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen crossed his hands in front of him and dipped his head as if he was submitting to the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment the man let down his guard, Ye Zichen raised his fist and punched him, “F*ck you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His fist of rage punched the man directly into the sky, before he hit the floor. Seeing that, all of the criminals in the surroundings raised their guns and pulled the trigger towards Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But…</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were no gunshots.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Those are no good now, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows and looked at the criminals, then kicked them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Liu Qing, good job.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye ZIchen gave a thumbs up to Liu Qing, who was in midair, then easily dispatched the rest of the criminals before walking in front of the first man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you know that you really pissed laozi off?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stepped onto the man’s arm that was reached for his gun, snatched the gun over and pointed it at the man’s temples.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Say it, who told you to do this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen essentially roared this out. It was fine to deal with him, but Bai Yu and Kang Peng were innocent.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>They were only his roommates, but they had to suffer this sort of catastrophe!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Say it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen hit the man on his stomach, then pointed the gun right at the man’s temples.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll shoot you if you don’t say it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man, who was completely suppressed by Ye Zichen, suddenly laughed. Broken teeth flowed out along with blood form his mouth as he said, “Brat, I have principles. I can’t reveal my employer. Just shoot.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you believe that I’ll really kill you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I believe you, shoot.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man slowly closed his eyes as if he truly did not care about living any more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The hand Ye Zichen was holding the gun with begun to tremble.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>How would he dare to pull the trigger?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, Ye Zichen had an idea. He casually chucked the gun onto the floor. The man also opened his eyes at the same time and smiled playfully, “What, you don’t dare?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe… Letting you die so easily is too good for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye ZIchen used his right index finger to press onto a point on the man’s waist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Enjoy this, then decide whether to tell me or not.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen threw the man aside and ran in front of Bai Yu and Kang Peng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was unknown what sort of torture the two of them of them had been subjected to before he arrived, their faces were completely bloodied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bai Yu, Kang Peng!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shook their shoulders intensely. After a long while, they slowly opened their eyes, “Ye-zi…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Swallow it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen got a Great Recovery Pill from his WeChat, broke it in half and stuffed it into their mouths. The moment the pill entered their mouths, color gradually returned to their pale faces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, the man that had kidnapped Bai Yu and Kang Peng did not take Ye Zichen seriously at all. Even when Ye Zichen had the absolute advantage, even if he was so near death, he was never afraid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Until Ye Zichen pressed down on his waist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He felt like his entire body was emptied. It was as if a knife cut into his stomach repeatedly, causing piercing pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, he felt as if he slowly lost the feeling of his lower body. When he looked down, what he saw was a pool of blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you do to me…” The man yelled out in fright.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen walked towards him with a light smile, “Did you think it through? Tell me, who exactly told you to do this!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can’t…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, then enjoy!” Ye Zichen shrugged and stood up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the man suddenly spoke, “I’ll say it… Young Master Fu told us to do it. He said that It’s only the beginning, he will screw over everyone around you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen kicked the man and opened his eyes wide.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fu Chengming…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen called Commissioner Liu in order to ask him to take care of the location, then sent Bai Yu and Keng Peng to the hospital.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who sat in a chair in the corridor outside the ward with his eyes completely red with rage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regardless of what ploys Fu Chengming used against Ye Zichen before, he could accept it. But this time, he had really touched Ye Zichen’s bottom line.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen picked up his phone and said sullenly into it, “Tell me Fu Chengming’s location.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within a certain high class business club.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck, they couldn’t even do something that simple.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Fu Chengming hung up, his entire face turned gloomy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Fu…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck off, f*ck off… All f*cking f*ck off,” Fu Chengming, who sat on the sofa, suddenly went mad, smashing all of the drinks on the tea table onto the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All the escorts in the room were freaked out, causing them to run frantically away from the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All f*cking trash.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the escorts left, Fu Chengming cursed sullenly within the room. Yet, at that moment, the door to the room was kicked open.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stood alone in front of the room. He looked at Fu Chengming coldly and smiled, “Young Master Fu, it took me so long to find you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dark voice sounded like a howl of a beast from hell. The hot temperature in the room also turned beyond cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fu Chengming stood up in fright. He acted cocky, using the people and money he had.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he was alone facing Ye Zichen’s cold gaze…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you want?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe,” Ye Zichen suddenly snickered and slammed the door shut.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you think?”</span></p>
