 <p><span style>Chapter 126 – Zu Siliang</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was certain that this girl called Liu Qianqian was definitely the Lucy he knew.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the entire journey, Ye Zichen’s gaze has never left her and vice versa.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi, you guys came way too slowly. I’ve been waiting here for ages.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun immediately walked over with a smile when they got to the venue. When Liu Qianqian saw him, she subconsciously took a step back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did Lucy come as well…”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Lucy!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qianqian was in a terrible mood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why was she so unlucky recently? The two people she got drinks from at the bar were actually both from Polytechnic University and knew her roommates.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, Su Yan and co. started looking at Liu Qianqian rather weirdly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen also took the opportunity to stab her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t say that, this girl is not the Lucy, who was asking for drinks from us at the bar, she’s the school beauty of our school, Liu Qianqian.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he said that, he put very heavy emphasis on the important words like “bar”, “drinks” and “Lucy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qianqian rolled her eyes and shrugged, “Alright, alright, I’m Lucy, alright? Seriously, why did I meet such a petty man like you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m petty!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was furious. If he didn’t guess wrong, he seemed to have helped this woman out more than once.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She actually said that he was petty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, alright, we’re all friends here,” Sun Yige, who did not speak until now, suddenly spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes at Liu Qianqian and snorted, “Since our class rep said that, then I’ll leave some face for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk, petty,” The moment she said that, she went over to Su Yan and muttered. “Su Yan, this guy is too petty, you can’t be with him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Woman, there’s something wrong with you, right!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qianqian made a face at him and stuck her tongue out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“None of your business!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone in the surroundings quickly held Ye Zichen back. Since there was nothing he could do, he could only maintain his dark expression and shake in anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yang Yushi is here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A black van stopped outside the entrance of the stadium, while a group of boys and girls with flowers surrounded it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, a random firework was shot outside the stadium.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A few words also surfaced on the LED screen of a high class office building opposite the sports stadium.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yang Yushi, marry me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, so romantic!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke exclaimed as she supported her face with her hands, while the other girls also looked at everything enviously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All girls loved romance. Meanwhile, Ye Zichen and the other guys twitched their mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gaudy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Demagogic.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Useless as shit, a waste of money!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as if Yang Yushi was already used to all of that, she she gradually walked out of the crowd under the protection of ten-odd bodyguards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, a handsome man in a blue suit stood stark straight as he held up a bouquet of roses and waited.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You came.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Yushi smiled with a comforting look in her eyes, while the man, who had been waiting in front, walked toward her with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I came.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Yang Yushi, who just got out of the car, directly walked by him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The expression man, who was ignored by Yang Yushi, tensed up. When he turned his head back, he saw that she had already walked in front of Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I thought you wouldn’t come.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A soft commotion spread out from both the people that came with Ye ZIchen and the surrounding fans.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kang Peng subconsciously moved aside, while Su Yiyun also pulled Su Yan and co. away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, only Ye Zichen and Yang Yushi were left in the protective circle of the bodyguards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Speak, you’re not stupid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Yushi’s tone carried a faint anxiousness. Ye Zichen licked his lips and raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ai, did I see it wrong? Is he Ye Zichen?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He seems to be.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen could be said as a rather popular internet celebrity recently. He even knows Yang Yushi…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The video of Ye Zichen singing during the school anniversary gala was truly too popular on Weibo. It made it to the top of the charts of a whole two weeks, so it was hard for him not to get famous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The surrounding fans gradually recognized him and some of the people that enjoyed gossip even found the information on them secretly meeting in a coffee shop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s get to know each other. I’m Zu Siliang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man that wanted to propose to Yang Yushi suddenly popped up and reached out his hand towards Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man’s voice was full of charisma, while his deep eyes caused the female fans around Yang Yushi to scream.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t need to know me. I’m just a small fry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen laughed softly. Then he nodded towards Zu Siliang and looked back towards Yang Yushi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I wish your concert to be a success.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, he turned back and return to the side of Su Yan’s group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Yushi pursed her lips and watched them leave. Meanwhile, Zu Siliang also retracted the hand that was left hanging.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He turned around and handed the bouquet of roses in his hand to Yang Yushi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zu Siliang, put away your favor, we really aren’t suitable for each other. Even if my dad is interested in matching us, I still won’t accept you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem, I won’t force you. You’ll accept me one day.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zu Siliang casually handed the bouquet of roses to one of the bodyguards, then smiled, before stepping back to open the way to the venue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Yushi directly left without looking to the side. Zu Siliang also called his subordinate over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to know the relationship between Yang Yushi and the man just now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When his bodyguard left his side, Zu Siliang twisted his head and smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi, what is your relationship with Yang Yushi?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why do you know Yang Yushi? It seems like your relationship isn’t that simple!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What exactly is Yang Yushi’s relationship with you!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry up and speak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The surrounding people all had their interest of gossip fired up with Zhang Rui in the lead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was slightly angered by their questions, “Why do you guys have so many questions? Do you want to watch the concert or not? If you don’t, then just go back to the dorms!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone stopped when they felt that Ye Zichen was truly angry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked back at the entrance to the venue. If there was no surprise, the man should be the business marriage partner that Yang Yushi’s father chose for her.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Not bad, at least he looked okay.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The tickets Yang Yushi gave him were for the first row of the infield seats, in other words, it was the seats closest to the stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at the stage dumbly, while the images of their past played in his mind.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>How could I not feel terrible!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I loved her, yet I had to let her go with a smile.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Ye Zichen was reminiscing of the past, his phone suddenly rang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He quickly took out his phone and saw that Erlang Shen had sent him a message.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could it be that there was information on King Qinguang?</span></i></p>
