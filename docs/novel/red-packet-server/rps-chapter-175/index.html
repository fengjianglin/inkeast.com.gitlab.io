 <p><span style>Chapter 175 – Red Packet Server</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wow.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>All the deities who were looking at their phone within the Heavenly Court, were shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As one of the Four Northern Saints, the Canopy Marshal had already been famous for a long time. Although he did stay in the Buddhist region for a while, his reputation in the Heavenly Court was still rather major.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, he was someone on the Reputation Leaderboard of the Three Realms. It could be said that Taibai Jinxing was making the Canopy Marshal lose a lot of face by punishing him publicly like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha, Taibai Jinxing, such authority.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal replied like he was going to argue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Watching intently. Old Pig, I support you! Flame!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: Timidly watching the flame war.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: I’m not going to say much, just going to lurk…</span></p>
 <p><span style>While all the deities acted like they weren’t afraid of the situation becoming more severe…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: Selling melon seeds, peanuts, water, spicy gluten, coke and chestnut cake. During this period of time, everything’s 10% off. Hurry if you wish to buy any.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ha.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao’s entrance instantly destroyed the heavy atmosphere, while Ye Zichen forcefully resisted laughing. Meanwhile, the deities all started to say that they wanted to buy something, but Canopy Marshal remained strong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Taibai Jinxing, say, just what regulations did I, Old Pig, break?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please don’t be angry, Canopy Marshal. These are extreme times!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Extreme? You are determined to set I, Old Pig, as an example because it’s extreme times? If my Monkey Bro was here, would you dare to punish me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Canopy Marshal, watch your words!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the looks of it, they really were about to argue. Ye Zichen’s expression tensed up when he saw this, while the other deities in the group also quieted down when they smelled the gunpowder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, you don’t dare, right? You guys are afraid of my Monkey Bro, right! Back then, when my Monkey Bro wreaked havoc in the Heavenly Court, it caused a lot of trouble for you guys, right! Fine, I, Old Pig, have served the Heavenly Court for a hundred thousand years, and endured work and sufferings! When the Jade Emperor exiled me to the mortal realm, I did not resist, do you guys really think that I, Old Pig, is someone that anyone can bully?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He was truly angry!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>The fact that he started to talk about all the past issues made it seem like it wasn’t going to end well.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Even a master flamer like Erlang Shen stopped speaking under this sort of atmosphere. All the deities looked at their screens silently as they awaited Taibai Jinxing’s reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Canopy Marshal!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmph, you still know that I’m the Canopy Marshal!? Yes, I am the Canopy Marshal! Canopy Marshal of the Four Northern Saints!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Canopy Marshal, what do you want!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do I want? I, Old Pig, am not going to stay in this shitty group anymore!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment he saw this message, Ye Zichen immediately looked at the members list of the group.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He wasn’t kidding!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Canopy Marshal really left the group.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, the other deities also the same thing like Ye Zichen, causing the group to explode after they realized that Canopy Marshal had left the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: He really quit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mother of Lightning: Canopy Marshal wasn’t kidding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King Li: It seems like he was truly angry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: He has a temper. I didn’t expect that the Monkey wasn’t the only one with a temper. He’s truly one of the Four Northern Saints. Cool!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing: @Erlang Shen, it seems like you want to be punished as well?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The group went quiet once again.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Was there something wrong with Taibai Jinxing today? He always acted like the good guy in the Heavenly Court, why is he lashing out at the slightest thing now?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: @Taibai Jinxing, are you trying to scare me? Stop bothering me, if you push me to the corner, then laozi is quitting the group as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing: No need for you to quit. I’ll kick you.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Damn!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen truly felt busy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He quickly looked at the members list!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen was gone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The group instantly turned terrifyingly quiet, while Ye Zichen clicked on his Moments subconsciously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The newest status was sent by Erlang Shen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Taibai Jinxing, such authority. Fine, laozi isn’t going to be in the group anymore!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal’s comment was below.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: You got kicked?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Yeah, what a crappy place. Even if he didn’t kick me, I wouldn’t want to stay there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: Come have a drink at my place?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Sure.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Having two of the pillars of the Heavenly Court leave the group, seriously…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Geezer Taibai Jinxing woke up on the wrong side of bed, right?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen licked his lips, then suddenly thought of an idea.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>If the Heavenly Court group didn’t want them, I do!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You invited Erlang Shen and Canopy Marshal into the group chat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The name of the group was changed to “Red Packet Server”.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Bro, what is this?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: Sky Sovereign, this…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Actually, I have been dissatisfied with that Taibai Jinxing for the longest time. Let’s not stay in the Heavenly Court group anymore. From now on, this group will the second Heavenly Court communication group. It’s for the celestial friends in the Heavenly Court to chat and send red packets. If anyone quits the other group, then drag them here. But the criteria is that… No dragging anyone still in the Heavenly Court group in.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: Sure!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: No problem!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then that’s that. I saw that you guys seemed to be going to drink, I won’t disturb you. I’ll send you guys a bottle of good wine from my side.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: That sounds great, then I’ll be waiting for Sky Sovereign’s red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Send a bit more!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled idiotically after leaving the Red Packet Server.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was already very annoyed when Taibai Jinxing had trapped him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This is great now, two huge people in the Heavenly Court quitting the group was definitely a great thing for him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck, I’ll show you who is in charge in the Heavenly Court in the future.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, what are you laughing so idiotically for!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Ye Zichen felt someone call out beside his ear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He turned around…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei stared at him with a face full of curiosity, while Li Shuang had already disappeared from the VIP room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You two finished chatting?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm,” Xiao Yumei replied softly with a nod. “That girl studied business management in Switzerland and have a very unique view in management. She’s definitely a talent.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s good that she can help you,” Ye Zichen caressed Xiao Yumei’s hair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she curled her lips and said rather playfully, “You sure that you want her to help me, and it’s not that you want me to help you to take care of a new little sister?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You thought too much into it. There’s nothing between the girl and I. We just coincidentally met the other day, so I arranged for her to be the shop manager. I only introduced her to you because I felt that she was rather capable, so she can help shoulder some of your burdens. I don’t want you to be too tired.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I swear to God!” Ye Zichen replied seriously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, then I’ll believe you,” Xiao Yumei kissed Ye Zichen on the cheek.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, the door of the VIp room was knocked on again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come in.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mei-jie, I handled everything already.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Mei-jie!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t expect that their relationship had already improved to this degree while he was looking at the group chat!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since you have handled it, then let’s go,” said Xiao Yumei, as she stood up from the sofa.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen followed behind her with a face of confusion and raised his eyebrows, “Where are you to going?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course it’s to work.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go and find the little sisters.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Xiao Yumei smiled and left the VIP room with Li Shuang in tow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was left all alone, standing on the spot…</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, he felt like an abandoned child.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Brrring, brrring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the meeting reminder sound of his phone sounded out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen took a look at his reminders, and frowned.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck, I nearly forgot!</span></i></p>
