 <p><span style>Chapter 226 – Catching a Thief</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Yu heard Ye Zichen’s words, his gaze gradually turned from shock to excitement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you speaking the truth?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>To be honest, Yu’s anticipating gaze gave Ye Zichen quite a bit of pressure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen twitched his mouth, then touched the phone in his pocket, “I can’t promise that I will be able to find her spiritual soul, but I will do my best.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He’s kneeling again.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“If you can save Ling’er, then my life is yours…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the heck was with this bro? He just kneels so suddenly, doesn’t he know that men have gold under their knees?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen interrupted Yu’s words that were about to express his loyalty and spoke helplessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t want your life, I just hope that you won’t randomly come to kill me. I’m a coward, and your assassinations always freak me out. As for whether I can find it, it’s still unknown. If I really can, then I’ll be satisfied if you just keep a thankful heart and don’t cause trouble for me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No matter what the result is, I won’t cause trouble for you,” Yu stood up from the ground with Ye Zichen’s help and answered with determined eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu wasn’t a person without a conscience. Instead, he paid a lot of weight on relationships. However, since he had no choice, he could only discard the so-called conscience for Ling’er.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s for the best,” Ye Zichen smiled and shrugged. Then, he took out a cheque book from his pocket and wrote a number on it, before handing the cheque to Yu. “Don’t live underneath the bridge from now on, use this money to rent a home.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How-How could I accept your money?” Yu raised his hand and refused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not some goody two shoes, just treat it as me lending you the money. I think that with your abilities, you should be able to easily pay me back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a bit more comforting, Yu finally received the cheque solemnly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen glanced at Yu’s pale face. It was clear that Fourth Hou’s punch had caused quite a bit of damage to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Take the pill I gave you later. It’ll help with your recovery.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m going to save it for Ling’er.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s the point of saving it,” Ye Zichen smiled wryly. “Since I can casually give you one, do you think it’s something rare? When this friend of yours truly recovers, then I’ll give more to you. Oh yeah, what is she called?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zhang Lingling!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay, then wait for my news, if I find her spiritual soul, then I will contact you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen left from the bottom of the bridge, he let out a sigh.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I finally managed to defuse the ticking time bomb.</span></i><span style> With the Hou Brothers and Soul Pearl Yiyuan’s protection, Ye Zichen wasn’t too afraid that Yu would pose a threat to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, that bro was relentless. What’s more, even though he had bodyguards, his family and friends didn’t.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Yu went crazy and made a move on his family…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Basically, calming Yu down was for the best.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu, who was underneath the bridge, watched Ye Zichen’s retreating figure, then looked down at the cheque in his hand, while his gaze would show that he was slightly moved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the phone in his pocket rang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He took out a second-handed phone worth only a two digit amount. When he saw the caller ID, he lowered his head and looked at Zhang Lingling, who was lying on the ground and placed the phone by his ear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Ye Zichen sat on a park bench with squinted eyes as he focused on the screen of his phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He automatically disregarded those words of congratulations and the deities that wanted to add him in order to cuss at him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>If I want to find Zhang Lingling’s spiritual soul, I can only start from people in the Underworld.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>When considering the intimacy level, White Impermanence was his only option.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he didn’t message her immediately. At this hour, she should still be resting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Choo choo…” Liu Qing popped out at an unknown time and continuously made weird noises as she stood behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen turned his head and rolled his eyes at her, “What do you want to do now!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not going to do anything at all,” Liu Qing blinked, then floated to sit down beside him. “I saw that the Zhang Lingling just now looked pretty good. Is the harem going to increase by another one?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you a retard?” Ye Zichen stared at her. “If I pick up one whenever I see one, just how loving am I? Even if I don’t consider Su Yan and co.’s feelings, shouldn’t I still consider about my old waist?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Waist?” Liu Qing was confused. However, when she saw Ye Zichen’s slightly ambiguous gaze, she bit her lips and slapped him. “Shameless.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Catch the thief!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brat, stop!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment, the loud roars of several men suddenly resonated through the park.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked up and saw a young man holding a lady’s bag frantically run as fast as the wind as he occasionally looked back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A large group of guys followed behind him and chased him as they shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Does everyone like being a samaritan now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen scratched his head and stood up from the bench, causing the thief, who was looking around, to bump into Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Ye Zichen had Unbreakable body activated, that bump…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was like hitting himself on an iron plate, resulting in the thief getting completely confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why aren’t you learning to be good when you’re so young, and instead decided to steal someone else’s bag!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man only looked to be in his early twenties. From his delicate appearance, he didn’t seem to be any person of great evil.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at the men fiercely screaming out to catch the thief behind them, he let out a sigh, then took the bag from the young man’s hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m taking the bag, I’ll just treat it like I didn’t see you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man looked at Ye Zichen blankly for a moment, then immediately ran away with a thankful look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did you let him run?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you a cohort of that thief? Why did you let him go just now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the men, who were catching the thief hurried over, they immediately started to make it difficult for Ye Zichen as they looked at the thief, who was running away, and the bag in Ye Zichen’s hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? Here, take the bag, go and get praised.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen handed the bag to one of the men. He thought that they would return the bag to the owner of it, but what he didn’t expect was…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Give it to me!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Give it to me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All of you, let go, my big bro is Brother Scar from around here, if you fight with me over it, then I’ll get my big bro to kill you all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck off, laozi is police in the area, just try to get your big bro to come…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The men howled as they fought over the bag. Ye Zichen stood on the side with a confused look as he watched on.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the hell, why did they start fighting?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen saw that the bag was nearly ripped apart by them, he saw Sun Yige run over, out of breath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the men saw Sun Yige, they also fought over the bag even more intently as if they were doped up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What made Ye Zichen more speechless was that one of them kicked another one, causing the entire group to turn completely chaotic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sun Yige also stood dumbly on the spot when she saw that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen walked next to her, “That bag is yours?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A hint of red surfaced on Sun Yige’s face, then she instantly bit her lips and nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I’ll help you get it back.”</span></p>
