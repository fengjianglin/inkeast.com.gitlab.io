 <p><span style>Chapter 119 – Ghost Suppressing</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t let it succeed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Tian frowned. This sort of evil ghosts loved yin energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A woman had plenty of yin energy. The consequences were unimaginable, if the ghost succeeded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichhen frowned, and ran over quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who-Who allowed you turn your head,” Lucy saw that Ye Zichen already ran in front of her before she put on her pants.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen hugged Lucy, then punched the shadow with his right hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahhhh…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A chilling scream sounded out. Ye Zichen ignored the gender of the ghost, and kicked its crotch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Lucy’s lower body was still naked, what’s more, Ye Zichen’s hands when he grabbed her…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pervert.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen suddenly slapped him, causing Ye Zichen, who was still fighting with the evil ghost, to get confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is there something wrong with you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re sick. I’m going to call the police, you molested a young girl,” Lucy screamed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Ye Zichen snickered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then checked her out without any restraint.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do all young girls develop so well now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen,” Liu Qing, who was in the Dragon Eye exclaimed. Ye Zichen smiled without worrying at all, and directly punched the evil ghost on the nose without turning his head back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gu Tian, play with this kid for a while.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Tian, who was on the side, was completely shocked. He has watched his family exorcise ghosts for so many years, but he has never seen anyone who fought ghosts directly like Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Tian nodded subconsciously, then went up to meet the ghost.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Ye Zichen also put Lucy to the side, and opened WeChat on his phone…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you doing!” Lucy immediately tried to take Ye Zichen’s phone away. “I’m telling you, don’t think about threatening me with photos. If you dare to take any, then I’ll call the police!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Girl, do you have a delusion of being forced?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes in annoyance and opened the Yinyang Box in his phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a Ghost Controlling Sigil that White Impermanence gave him within. He didn’t know whether it would be useful against this guy or not.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Withdraw.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A pale yellow sigil appeared in his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other side, Gu Tian got a peach wood sword from somewhere and traced it at the ghost.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen only had one thought after seeing that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Low!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Too low!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Splat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen spat a bit of saliva onto the sigil, then leaped over to stick it onto the ghost’s head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ghost instantly stopped after it was stuck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sigil on its forehead also gradually dimmed, until it finally disappeared from its forehead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, the Ghost Controlling Sigil returned to the Yinyang Box in his phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only change was that the remaining number of ghosts that could be controlled became 2.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come with me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen curled his fingers at the evil ghost. After the Ghost Controlling Sigil entered its body, the evil ghost would need to listen to his commands completely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Under Gu Tian’s shocked look, the evil ghost gradually revealed its true form and walked towards Ye Zichen respectfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The true form of the evil ghost was a muscular man. It looks like he was very likely a soldier while he was alive!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, it was possible that he was a mercenary or a contract killer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This manner of address shocked Gu Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen caused the ghost to submit?</span></p>
 <p><span style>They could see the existence of the ghost, but Lucy couldn’t!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are you talking to?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“To a ghost,” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes in annoyance. “Girl, you really don’t recognize good will? If laozi didn’t save you just now, don’t talk about putting on your pants, you might have directly died, you know?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are you trying to trick!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lucy twitched her mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen indicated towards the evil ghost, “Let the friend over there feel your existence.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The hulk walked over with a clenched fist. Not long later, Lucy felt a chilling cold surround her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She couldn’t help but shiver, then screamed as she ran over to Ye Zichen’s side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you believe me now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I…” Lucy hugged her arms and shivered, while her entire pale turned pale as she was unable to utter a word for along time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pursed his lips and smiled, then looked at her lower body, “Girl, you didn’t put on your pants yet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You… I… Ahhh…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The evil ghost completely submitted to Ye Zichen by the time the left the old manor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since it wasn’t good to keep calling him evil ghost, Ye Zichen named him Blackie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Making a pair with the Lil’ White at home.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Gu Tian’s gaze towards Ye Zichen turned weirder and weirder, and it was the same with Lucy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You didn’t take any photos, right?” Lucy hugged her shoulders and stared right at Ye Zichen. “If you did, then you’re screwed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not interested in young girls,” Ye Zichen laughed playfully. He only chuckled when he saw her face turn bright red. “What did you come here for? Don’t you know that this is a haunted mansion?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What haunted mansion? This is my home!” Lucy lifted her head. “You’re lucky I didn’t sue you guys for trespassing yet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked towards Gu Tian. When he saw Gu Tian shrug, he knew that Gu Tian didn’t know that anyone was still living there either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen checked Lucy out. It really was a miracle that the girl would live there and be alright.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you looking at? I don’t live here, this is a very old house, I just came here to find some stuff.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, you’re still amazing, peeing all over the place in your home. Wouldn’t your parents beat you to death if they knew?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I-I couldn’t hold it in!” Lucy raised her eyebrows. “What’s more, that was originally the bathroom.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that so?” Ye Zichen looked at her meaningfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lucy bit her lips, pouted and bumped into him, before glaring at him, “I’m telling you, if I let you know… We’ll see.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Lucy ran away. Ye Zichen thought that the girl was shy, but then he heard Blackie mention, “Boss, you lost something.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lost something?” Ye Zichen was stunned. Blackie nodded, “When the girl bumped into you just now, she stole a few pieces of paper from your pocket.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen reached into the pocket that held Yang Yushi’s concert tickets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He checked the remaining number.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Four were truly missing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, this woman…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lucy finally stopped and twitched her mouth proudly after running for five or six minutes straight, “What an idiot. He doesn’t even know that he lost his concert tickets.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although she knew that stealing was bad, but…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That bastard already saw her like that, so what if she took a few tickets from him.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Thinking that, Lucy’s instantly felt good about herself, and dialed a number.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yige, are you at the dorm? Hurry and call the two of them over as well. I have a present for you guys.”</span></p>
