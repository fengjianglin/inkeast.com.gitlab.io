 <p><span style>Chapter 745 – Time’s Up</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nobody expected such an ending, or rather, a beginning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing patted away the dirt on her knees and wrapped her arms around Ye Zichen’s arm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blood and tears were still on her face and it was extremely eye-catching under the sun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cui Twelve couldn’t help but turn around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was it really worth it?</span></p>
 <p><span style>For him?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go,” Liu Qing wiped away the tears from her eyes and smiled as she always did. “I can’t stay here too long, I promised Big Sister Lin Ru that I can only stay here for half a day.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She smiled sweetly as if she didn’t care about what just happened, it was as if she was not begging her heart out on the ground just moments ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of it was just for this short half a day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, Ye Zichen did not want to get to the bottom of why she acted so. Everything had already happened, so there was no need to think about it anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That being said, he just didn’t understand why she seemed so desperate!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It’s not like we can’t see each other in the future, why did she act like that?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uhm…” In the end, Ye Zichen was still unable to force down his curiosity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it?” Liu Qing smiled. “Just let bygones be bygones. I just want to peacefully stay with you for half a day without anyone bothering me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the Jade Emperor reached his hand out in shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing’s decision to kneel completely stunned him. She is the God Realm’s messenger! He had borne witness to the strength of the messenger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But she actually kneeled…</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of that was so shocking that he forgot the thing that was on his mind before he went on the whole trip for a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The leyline!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After seeing how strong the people from the God Realm and Demon Realm are, he became more desperate to ascend to where he wished to be.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wanted to be like Sid and Liu Qing and be able to move the heavens and earth. Yes, he could do it here…</span></p>
 <p><span style>But it was just a lower realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Some people say that it is better to be the biggest fish in a small pond rather than a small fish in an ocean.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But no matter what happens, the ocean was still far superior to a small pond.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And that has been his ambition all along.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, would he end up as a weakling in the higher realm his whole life?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He did not believe that would happen to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm?” Meanwhile, Liu Qing furrowed her eyebrows before Ye Zichen could say anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was extremely displeased that someone was interrupting her moment with Ye Zichen!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Jade Emperor gulped after noticing the hostility oozing from Liu Qing, “Messenger, do you remember what I discussed with Brother Ye before we went off?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can you not talk about it after I leave?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright now,” Ye Zichen rubbed Liu Qing’s head, then pointed towards where the ley line was. “The ley line is in the Valley of Death, just go over with the Great Sacred Emperor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He knew how desperate the Jade Emperor wanted to break through to the next level, so he immediately pointed the path out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Jade Emperor did notice where the ley line was when he returned, but he wasn’t sure of how Liu Qing would react if he went over there directly. For some reason, he felt like she was in a deep relationship with Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And now that he got the confirmation, he hurried over to the ley line.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Ye, then I’ll be going too,” the Great Sacred Emperor was not as desperate as the Jade Emperor, so he waited until Ye Zichen nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve heard a lot about how amazing the ley line is in the God Realm, I’m going to go and take a look as well. I’ll come and get you when the time is up,” Cui Twelve said to Liu Qing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing smiled with a nod and watched him leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, a small silent frown flashed across Ye Zichen’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now, all these annoying people are finally gone. It’s just us left. I’m telling you, you have to only be with me during this half a day, got it? You’re not allowed to go anywhere else no matter who comes looking for you, got it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm? I’m asking you, got it?” Liu Qing pouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Got it. I promise that this half a day is yours, no matter who comes for me,” Ye Zichen chuckled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Half a day was extremely short, so short that it flew by without them ever noticing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen did manage to keep his promise and spend the entire time with Liu Qing as they journeyed across the beautiful mountain ranges of the Immortal Region.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they were both a bit tired, they stopped by on the peak of a mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing leaned her head on Ye Zichen’s shoulder and watched the gradually setting sun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoosh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little Seventeen, it’s time. We have to get back,” Cui Twelve’s sudden arrival destroyed the serene atmosphere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Liu Qing, who was wearing a red flower on her head, opened her eyes in shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she saw Cui Twelve standing behind them, her sweet smile turned into a heart-paining look of sadness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is it time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm,” Cui Twelve couldn’t bear it, but he still nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing stood up from the side of the cliff.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Ye Zichen stood up alongside her, she muttered to herself, “Time passed by so quickly. I thought half a day would be a really long time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How long can that be? Hurry, come with me. You promised that person that you’ll only stay for twelve hours,” Cui Twelve said rather coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing nodded, then turned around with a smile, “Time’s up, so I’ll have to go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Time’s up!?</span></p>
 <p><span style>When did they care so much about being on time?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if Lin Ru’s the Master of the Law, I’m sure she wouldn’t mind if Liu Qing stays for a bit longer!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you want to stay here, then I’ll go and talk to Lin Ru.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need, time’s up,” Liu Qing shook her head with a smile, then opened her arms. “Can you hug me again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen slowly pulled her into his embrace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing hugged him tightly as if she was trying to become one with Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little Seventeen, the time…” Cui Twelve hurried her up like an alarm clock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing took a deep breath, then pushed Ye Zichen away. “I’ll go now. Make sure to lay low a bit without me backing you up. Don’t always offend those people who you can’t beat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, I can beat everyone if you guys from up there don’t come down,” Ye Zichen laughed, then caressed Liu Qing’s hair. “If you miss me, then come down for a while. If you can’t, then wait for me to ascend to the God Realm to find you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okie, don’t lie to me about that,” Liu Qing giggled with her hands behind her back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why would I lie to you? If you don’t believe me, then… pinky promise?” Ye Zichen reached his pinky out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing’s eyes teared up. She forced herself not to cry and reached out with her pinky, “It’s a promise.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I wish time could stop here, but time won’t listen to me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With Cui Twelve hurrying her up again and again, Liu Qing finally put down her hands and waved her goodbye to Ye Zichen before slowly starting to walk away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But after a while… She suddenly turned around and ran back towards Ye Zichen, “No, I don’t want to go, I don’t want to go…”</span></p>
