 <p><span style>Chapter 416 – The Huge Change in Stone Fairy</span></p>
 <p><span style>Flowers bloomed, and birds sang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan stood barefooted as she wore a long light red robe, with two golden bells tied at her waist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She stood amongst a mesmerizing sea of flowers. When she looked around in confusion, she saw a gravestone at the very center of the sea of flowers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She did not dare to read what was on the gravestone, since it really appeared very strange.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Su Yan,” a soft voice rang out by her ear. It was a alluring female voice, and was so soft that even as a girl, she couldn’t help but open her ears and want to hear the person speak more.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wait.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Su Yan shook her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She subconsciously gazed at the gravestone, and wanted to run away, but no matter how much she ran, she was unable to run out of the sea of flowers…</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was unable to run more than ten meters away from the gravestone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you running?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop speaking by my ear. Who are you? Just come out,” Su Yan stopped, while the bells at her waist occasionally rang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, the ringing of a bell sounded out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan was certain that it was not from the bell on her. When she looked up in shock, she saw a woman standing above the gravestone…</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was also barefooted, and wore the same red robe and bells…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only difference was that the woman looked far more mature than her, and her beauty even mesmerized women.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve come.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You… You…” Su Yan stuttered, but was unable to form her sentence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman tiptoed on the gravestone and smiled, “Me? What is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan pointed frantically at that woman and herself, then finally calmed down a little, “I seem to have seen you somewhere before.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What a cute child,” the woman squinted her eyes, then floated down from the gravestone and landed in front of Su Yan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She caressed Su yan’s hair, and looked into her eyes, “I’m you, aren’t I? Since you must have guessed it already, then just say it out bravely.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, she returned to the gravestone with a smile, “Why did you come here? Did… you reach your twentieth birthday?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Phew</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen let out a sigh, then opened his eyes and stood up from the ground. He wanted to grab the dragon race’s secret manual in front of him, but the old Dragon God behind him frowned, and put it away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked up in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing the confusion in Ye Zichen’s eyes, the old Dragon God squinted his eyes, “This old man doesn’t know what has happened to you, nor do I want to know… But you are too desperate for success right now. That has no benefit for your cultivation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s expression turned gloomy, as he pursed his lips, “How am I desperate for success? Am I not reading the secret manual bit by bit?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t swallow the date whole, and lap up information without digesting anything. From coming here until now, have you actually absorbed a single character from it?” the old Dragon God chucked the secret manual high up in the air, then waved his right sleeve. “Don’t come here currently. We’ll talk about it when you calm yourself down.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoosh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before Ye Zichen could reply, he already appeared in his bedroom in the mansion in the Modern Realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but sigh when he thought about what the old Dragon God had said.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Perhaps it is really as he says, and I’ve been too vying for a quick success. I desperately want to strengthen myself now, since I no longer want to feel powerless at key moments…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But… My heart is in chaos.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Normally speaking, Ye Zichen’s strength would increase slightly whenever he cultivated at the old Dragon God’s place, but this time, his cultivation actually decreased.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Seriously…” Ye Zichen shook his head, then picked up the phone he placed beside his bed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fact that there was 99+ unread messages confused him. When he looked at the group list…</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was actually his makeup class.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hundred Flowers Fairy: We’re going to have the lesson here? But why are we the only ones chatting?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Glaze Fairy: Maybe the teachers are all busy?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: Isn’t this Sky Sovereign’s group? I looked at the member list just now, he’s the chat owner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rainbow Fairy: Sky Sovereign?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: @Sky Sovereign Nameless, you created this group, right? What do you want to promote in the Heavenly Court now? It was all your doing that Stone Fairy turned pretty, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy was an active member of the Heavenly Court group chat, so it was no surprise for her to know Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen took a glance at the member list. It had already reached 19 people, most of who are fairies in the Heavenly Court. However, there was one person that caused Ye Zichen’s hand to shake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Golden Mother…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Queen Mother!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wow, Stone Fairy is pretty amazing. She actually even managed to get big shots of this level into the group.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen quickly closed the chat group, then quickly spammed his chat with Stone Fairy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stone Fairy, come out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? I’m on a date,” Stone Fairy answered in annoyance. At that moment, she was on a date with a new noble, so she was extremely displeased about getting interrupted by Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, since she was indebted to him, she can’t possibly ignore him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Date?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Stone Fairy is actually on a date? The Heavenly Court’s sense of beauty… No, the makeup and the massage cream probably came into effect.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Send me a photo.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s eyes opened wide when he received the photo.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is this still the f*cking Stone Fairy? </span></i><span style>Her rough look had already disappeared, and her muscular body had already slimmed down…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This ladylike girl… Is this really the Stone Fairy?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I admit that makeup can change a woman’s look, but this change is too much! What’s more, just how long has it been, the massage cream couldn’t have possibly changed her so much, right?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you get plastic surgery? How did you change so much?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The massage cream gave me was of a bit of use, but not too much. Since I leaned pill refinement with Old Lord Taishang for a while, I found some materials and managed to figure a new massage cream out. Ha… The effect of laoniang’s massage cream is A-MA-ZING…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Stone Fairy smiled proudly as she typed out her response, and that very smile completely charmed the new noble in front of her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Shi, I…” the deity in front of her wanted to speak, but stopped himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait a bit, this new noble seems to want to confess.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Stone Fairy giggled, then put her phone aside, and put on a kind and soft look as she blinked with a smile, “Mm, continue…”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck… Stone Fairy actually has that sort of effect? But this is good too. The more she changes, the greater the effect she’ll have on the Heavenly Court.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Back in the Makeup Lesson chat, the fairies were still chitchatting, and most of them asked about when the lessons would begin…</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no surprise that they were in a hurry, since Stone Fairy was truly too controversial in recent times. She was already ranked second on the Female Deity Controversial Leaderboard, right behind Chang’e.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Ye Zichen suddenly received a friend request.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Queen Mother has sent you a friend request.</span></p>
 <p></p>

 <p><i>In the make up lesson group.</i></p>
 <p><strong>Fairy A:&nbsp;</strong>Still no lessons today?</p>
 <p><strong>Fairy B:&nbsp;</strong>I dunno. I really want the lessons to start already! I'm super excited about it all!</p>
 <p><strong>Fairy C:&nbsp;</strong>Yeah! Stone Fairy is so pretty now. I really want to learn how she became like that.</p>
 <p><strong>Immortality Peach Fairy:&nbsp;</strong>So true! Also, I'm definitely sure that it'll be something amazing.</p>
 <p><strong>Fairy B:&nbsp;</strong>What do you mean?</p>
 <p><strong>Immortality Peach Fairy:&nbsp;</strong>Didn't you notice? This is Sky Sovereign's group!</p>
 <p><strong>Fairy C:&nbsp;</strong>Sky Sovereign?</p>
 <p><strong>Immortality Peach Fairy:&nbsp;</strong>Sky Sovereign Nameless! That super mysterious great deity who always have many different ideas!</p>
 <p><strong>Fairy A:&nbsp;</strong>Ooh, I know. He's dating Chang'e!</p>
