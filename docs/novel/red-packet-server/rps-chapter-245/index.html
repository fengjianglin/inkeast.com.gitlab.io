 <p><span style>Chapter 245 – Scum</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you going over there for? Aren’t we going to get drinks?” Lu Lu followed quickly behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen chuckled, then patted her shoulders, “Let me teach you something else. Although they say ignore it when it doesn’t concern you, there is another saying that says roar when you see unjust acts, and take action when the time is right!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen squinted his eyes and quickly walked towards the escalators.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he didn’t make a mistake, the woman mentioned Mu Jinglei. If it’s like that, then he must roar!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Li En, don’t think that I, Bao Xi, is an idiot. I know about your dealings behind my back very clearly!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman on the floor, who called herself Bao Xi, stared at the man in front of her and took out her phone and opened up the gallery…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The photos in the gallery were all ones Li En took with a woman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Beauty, can I take a look at those photos?” Ye Zichen smiled warmly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bao Xi nodded, handed the phone over and shouted, “Everyone, take a look. Remember the looks of this scum. If anyone knows the girl in the photo, hurry up and tell her to stay away from this scum. Otherwise, the current me is the future her…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the photos in the phone were clearly taken in secret, and most of them were merely their backs. However, one of the photos from the side allowed Ye Zichen to recognize that the girl was truly Mu Jinglei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen kicked Li En in rage, sending him flying four to five meters away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Lu Lu also helped Bao Xi up from the floor. At the same time, Ye Zichen cracked his neck and slowly walked towards Li En.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Security…” Li En called for the shopping mall’s security with fear in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen slapped Li En’s face, and grabbed him by the collar…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mu Jinglei is your girlfriend?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sec…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen slapped Li En once again, and this time, it caused Li En’s face to swell up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Answer my question.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You-You are her boyfriend? Impossible, she’s single,” Li En answered frantically.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Ye Zichen smiled, cracked his neck before slapping Li En once again, “It seems like that’s the case. Now, I announce that you two have broken up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thinking that it was about time the security arrived, Ye Zichen threw Li En back onto the ground with force.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t say that I didn’t warn you. If you don’t break up, then I’ll make it so that you can’t stay in Bingcheng anymore,” Ye Zichen snorted at Li En, then put his hands in his pockets and walked in front of Lu Lu and Bao Xi. “You aren’t unhappy that I hit your ex, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s better if you hit that scum to death,” Bao Xi cursed fiercely. “Do you know Mu Jinglei? If you know her, then hurry up and tell her not to be fooled by this scum’s appearance. Back then, I…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bao Xi couldn’t help but start crying when she mentioned her sadness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’ll all be over.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long after Ye Zichen and Li En left the escalator, the security team hurried over with Mu Jinglei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Li En,” Mu Jinglei squatted worriedly beside him and caressed Li En’s face with her fingers. “Why did you fight with someone else?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s nothing. Just now, an employee from my company came over to complain to me since her manager keeps on targeting her. I had wanted to enlighten her, but then she slapped me when she got worked up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You should handle the managers in your company properly. How can it be okay for you to take the blame whenever they do something wrong?” Mu Jinglei’s face was filled with anger and annoyance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li En smiled, then reached out to caress her hair, “Since I’m the boss, I have to give up more than others.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many people in the crowd were able to guess that the woman in front of them was the other woman in the incident.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Some nice people wanted to go and expose Li En, but they were yanked away by the people around them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since they heard that he had already established a company, it clearly meant that he wasn’t someone they could mess with.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li En stood up from the ground with Mu Jinglei’s support and dusted himself off with his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jinglei, we’ve known each other for more than a year. Actually, I have something that I’ve always wanted to say to you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you gonna say? Let’s go to the hospital first,” Mu Jinglei held Li En and started to walk out of the mall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Li En shook his head and took out a ring from his pocket, while he kneeled down with one leg, “Marry me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the pickup strategy that Li En used most. A proposal with a ring combined with his sweet words would make the majority of women climb onto his bed at night.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From his many years of experience of picking girls up, he could tell that Mu Jinglei was a virgin.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Didn’t that man want me to leave Mu Jinglei just now? Sure…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But even if I leave her, she’ll be a second-hand good then!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Jinglei was shocked by this as well. It was impossible for her heart not to be moved. During the year that they have been dating, Li En truly felt like her ideal type…</span></p>
 <p><span style>However…</span></p>
 <p><span style>She just felt like the two are still a distance away from getting married.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Jinglei bit her lips and helped Li En up, “Li En, can you let me consider it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What else is there to consider? Do you still need to test me after so long?” Li En questioned her in a perfect manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Jinglei shook her head, “No, but I just feel like we’re a distance away from getting married. Let me consider it, let’s go to the hospital to have a look at your injuries first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Never mind!” Li En, who had maintained a warm smile, suddenly flung Mu Jinglei’s hand away before turning towards the elevator to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, this was one of his many strategies as well – taking a step back to make two steps forward!</span></p>
 <p><span style>If there was no surprise, then Mu Jinglei would call him before sundown, and even if she doesn’t, he still have a plan B.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li En took out his phone, covered his swollen face and said sullenly to the person on the other side of the line, “Play a few huge ones with him, and this time, make him lose!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was able to learn from Bao Xi that Li En was the owner of a company. Of course, the company was rather small, but he was a successful person among his peers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen didn’t worry that much about it. He had already warned Li En. If Li En still doesn’t stop, then Ye Zichen wasn’t unwilling to use some methods that only dandies would use to deal with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sun set.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Due to Ye Zichen, the School Beauty Harvester, acting once again, his roommates decided to isolate him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was lonely as he laid on the dormitory bed and looked at WeChat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Aside from a few WeChat merchants, Yue Lao was the person that posted new stuff on his Moments the most frequently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the frequency had already dropped either due to complaints from the other deities, or because such frequent advertisement was no longer needed due to his reputation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingodng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Ye Zichen’s phone rang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a familiar sound.</span></p>
