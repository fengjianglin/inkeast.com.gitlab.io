 <p><span style>Chapter 302 – Huo Da is Caught</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Human Immortal?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows. </span><i><span style>Don’t cultivation levels only have Spiritual Body, Earth Immortals and Sky Immortals?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What level is Human Immortal?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t even know this?” Wei Chen put on a look of disdain as if he was looking down on Ye Zichen for asking such a simple question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he immediately gulped and smiled when he saw Ye Zichen’s hostile gaze, “I’m kidding, Boss Ye, please don’t mind it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop bullshitting around, hurry up and tell me,” Ye Zichen frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The levels in the Three Realms’ Immortal Region are split into five levels. Spiritual, Earth, Human, Sky and King. For Spiritual and Earth levels, there are only the early and late stages. For Human and Sky, there are the early, mid and late stages. I’m not so sure about King levels, but the Immortal Region doesn’t seem to have one of a King level yet!” Wei Chen explained with a smile, causing Ye Zichen to raise his eyebrows…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This was slightly different to what Third Fatty Jin said, but it is more precise. What’s worth noting is that the main body of the gramps from earlier is actually at the Human Immortal level or even higher!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>That’s pretty amazing.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you sure that only those of a Human Immortal level or higher can have Body Doubles?” Ye Zichen interrogated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m sure!” Wei Chen nodded in certainty. “If I can’t tell that something is a Body Double, then, in the Immortal Region, I don’t need to… Then I can’t exactly be there anymore! He was definitely a Body Double!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wei Chen clearly paused for a moment when he answered, but Ye Zichen did not notice it as he was still pondering about the old man’s identity.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That old man was really strange…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>He was beside Huo Da, but he seems to be helping me…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Huo Da, who was on the floor, suddenly stood up with the gun in his hand…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nobody move!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The security guards, who were going to subdue him, immediately stopped in their tracks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Huo Da also turned around with a mad smile in his eyes, “I didn’t think that you would even manage to cause my butler to defect! Ye Zichen, I truly underestimated you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If I say that I don’t have anything to do with your butler, would you believe it?” Ye Zichen smiled playfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck you, the shit are you trying to pretend for,” Huo Da bit his lips, while a crazy look appeared on his face. “Since my family has fallen into a decline, and those bastards won’t let my family turn the tables. It’s impossible for Xiao Yumei and I, so… Let’s die together…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The cartridge was empty!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had always maintained a calm smile, while the security guards, who were already prepared, immediately subdued Huo Da when they saw that the gun in Huo Da’s hand was empty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, organized footsteps echoed in the corridor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, a group of men in military uniform appeared at the doorway. The person in the lead was Su Yan’s father, Su Qihu!</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the security guards saw the epaulette on Su Qihu’s shoulders, they immediately saluted.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>From the looks of the standard salute, they should be veterans.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did Ye Zichen understand, while a wave of respect rose up in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just why were they able to stand so fearlessly in the room?</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was because of the iron-will of soldiers, something that normal people would not be able to understand. The word “fear” was not in their dictionaries, instead, it was filled with a single word – Justice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hello, I am Su Qihu, the Commanding General of Bingcheng’s Number One Military Region. I received orders to come and capture a criminal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The security guards instantly nodded and took a step back, displaying Huo Da, who was subdued on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What right do you have to capture me!? I didn’t commit any crimes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shut up, the heck are you screaming out for?” A security guard immediately elbowed him!</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Ye Zichen and Wei Chen also stood up from the sofa and walked over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Qihu was clearly momentarily stunned when he saw Ye Zichen, making it apparent that Old Man Su did not tell him that Ye Zichen was there as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To be perfectly honest, he still didn’t like Ye Zichen from the start.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had looked down on Ye Zichen from the beginning, but since he spoke with too much certainty on Old Man Su’s birthday feast, he was unable to interfere with Ye Zichen’s relationship with Su Yan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dad-in-law, you actually came in person!” Ye Zichen smiled playfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Qihu’s expression immediately turned dark when he heard Ye Zichen’s way of addressing him, while the soldiers behind him and the security guards in the room were clearly shocked…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Dad-in-law!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m on a mission. Also, don’t call me dad-in-law. I never recognized you!” Su Qihu glared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen chuckled, then didn’t annoy him further. Instead, Ye Zichen pointed at Huo Da, who was still struggling on the floor, “This grandson is the mastermind, as for over there… Huo Da’s the guy who killed the dead guy over there. The gun seems to have his fingerprints on it as well. He also pointed the gun at me just now, but it wasn’t of any use, so I just taught him a lesson!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re lying, I didn’t kill him!” Huo Da screamed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, you don’t get to decide whether you actually killed him or not,” Ye Zichen squinted his eyes with a smile. “They can just get the fingerprints on the gun tested.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Qihu nodded. </span><i><span style>If it wasn’t for how civilian-like and fickle in love this kid is, I would actually be rather satisfied with him due to his capability and bravery.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Take him away, and get the military’s forensic experts to examine the corpse!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, the soldiers behind Su Qihu immediately started to move. Meanwhile, Ye Zichen stayed in the room for a while longer as he was worried that Su Qihu wanted to ask him some questions to understand the situation further.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Su Qihu completely ignored him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you going to ask me anything? If you don’t, then I’m leaving. Don’t act like a kid and waste my time, I’m very busy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Su Qihu snorted, “You’re not needed, just screw off!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sigh, uncle, seriously…” Ye Zichen shook his head and twitched his mouth. “Then whatever, Old Wei, we’re leaving!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As there was nothing special to do after they left the hotel, Wei Chen returned to the teahouse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Ye Zichen stood at the side of the road in order to catch a taxi to the hospital. As for why he did not get Wei Chen to drive him over…</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was because the stingy man known as Wei Chen did not own a car!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wei Chen had even gone as far as to say that it was because cars cause pollution. A while ago, they had actually arrived at the hotel on the guy’s bicycle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen!” A call sounded out behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen turned around for a look, he saw Xia Keke, who was wearing sunglasses and a cap while holding a bag on her shoulders as if she had just returned from her travels, looked at him angrily with her hands on her hips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where did you go off to?” Ye Zichen walked over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke immediately smiled happily, “Susu and I went out to play, so we weren’t in school these few days!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>No wonder I didn’t see them in school recently. So they actually went out to travel. But I didn’t see Lu Lu recently either. Could she have gone out to play as well?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh yeah, I also brought you a present,” With that, she took out a clay doll from her bag. “For you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The clay doll was of a boy holding two girls. No matter how Ye Zichen looked at it, it looked to him like chibi versions of Xia Keke, Su Yan and him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This can’t be Su Yan and us, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re pretty observative!” Xia Keke smiled, then pointed at the clay doll. “This is the three of us. Susu and I ordered it there. We have one each and the dolls have our names underneath them. Let me show you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she said that, she walked over to grab Ye Zichen’s hand and lifted the clay doll.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, at that very moment, a look of shock appeared on her face. She immediately held his hand and pointed at the ring on his finger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where did you find this?”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Original Chapter Teaser:</b>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p><strong>Old Man Su:&nbsp;</strong>Son, go and capture the culprit behind the attempted murder of Maintaining Beauty International's CEO.</p>
 <p><strong>Su Qihu:&nbsp;</strong>Understood.</p>
 <p><strong>Old Man Su:&nbsp;</strong>Take a squad of your troops with you. Take him away, then throw him onto the court martial later.</p>
 <p><strong>Su Qihu:&nbsp;</strong>And the police?</p>
 <p><strong>Old Man Su:&nbsp;</strong>This isn't a simple attempted murder. This is one that is targeting the CEO of a company that is producing exclusive medicine for us. Those medicine could save countless lives. If the culprit had succeeded, then the situation of those kids that are fighting for our country won't improve at all.</p>
 <p><strong>Su Qihu:&nbsp;</strong>I understand, I'll go over to the location you told me earlier immediately.</p>
 <p><em>Su Qihu leaves.</em></p>
 <p><strong>Old Man Su:&nbsp;</strong>Bwahahahaha. I wonder what Qihu's going to be like when he see's Lil' Ye. Damn, I really wish I could see it in person. Maybe I should ask Lil' Ye to record it down for me? No, that'll be too strange, and difficult to do.</p>
