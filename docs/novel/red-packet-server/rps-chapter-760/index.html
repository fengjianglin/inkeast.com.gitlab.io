 <p><span style>Chapter 760 – Why are you so confident?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I really don’t know why you are so confident. Would you believe it if I tell you that nobody will shed even a single drop of tear for you if I just smacked you dead right now?” Now that Zuo Liang was definitely done for, Ye Zichen decided to mess around with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was rather curious about why Zuo Liang was still able to laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You wouldn’t dare,” Zuo Liang maintained his smile without any hint of nervousness. “I forgot at the start, you are already someone who belongs to the sacred land of the Immortal Region. That means you should know that they cannot interfere with the normal clans in the outer regions.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Continue.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then that’s it,” Zuo Liang smirked. “You should know that there are patrollers patrolling the outer regions, don’t you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As if on cue, a fat and a thin man appeared out of nowhere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The surrounding people looked at the pair in shock. Not long later, the thin man stepped forward and bowed towards Ye Zichen. “Your Majesty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…” Ye Zichen wrinkled his brows. He did go over to the sacred land of the Immortal Region after fully fusing with the Yellow Emperor’s memories, but he only stayed there for less than one day, he didn’t even manage to remember all the important people, so there was no way he was going to know these small fries.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We are the current patrollers on duty in the outer regions,” said the thin man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, the fat fatty fidgeted beside him. It was clear that he was rather nervous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did you come here?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“we sensed someone mentioning the sacred land of the Immortal Region, so we came to have a look. We did not expect Your Grace to be here,” the thin man replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ho? You managed to sense that?” Ye Zichen exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Zuo Liang snorted, “Great patrollers, please do this humble civilian justice. This Yellow Emperor of yours wants to interfere with our clan’s business.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm?” The thin man tiled his head and looked at Zuo Liang in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ignore him. Just go wait by the side,” Ye Zichen waved his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two patrollers obediently walked beside him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Liang was slightly stunned by this turn of events. He quickly frowned, “What? Are you not going to do anything when the Yellow Emperor’s trying to interfere with us?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry, we don’t have such rights,” the thin man nodded with an apologetic smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Liang nearly choked on that answer.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>No rights!?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I asked around before all this! The patrollers surpass anybody in the Immortal Region, and now they’re telling me that they have no rights? You’re kidding me!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, what a wonderful sacred land of the Immortal Region. We trusted you for several tens of thousands of years. Everyone here is important to the outer region. You people see this? This is the Immortal Region we placed our faith it. Doesn’t this mean that this Emperor Ye can just rob and kill whoever he wants? Since we don’t even have somewhere to voice our complaints, then we might as well turn on ti!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoosh…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before Zuo Liang could finish his sentence, a figure blinked in front of him. When Zuo Liang finally realized someone had appeared in front of him, he noticed a shimmering dagger against his throat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your spread of lies deserves death!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the nervous fatty.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Man, I really can’t judge a book by its cover. While he looks fat, he’s really quick on his toes.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The blade got even closer to Zuo Liang’s throat. A trickle of blood flowed down the blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Liang was terrified, he didn’t even dare to gulp. He could already feel the edge of the blade cutting against his skin. He was seriously afraid that the fatty will slice his throat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now, now, don’t scare him. We are from the sacred land of the Immortal Region, we are no bandits. Put the knife down,” Ye Zichen patted the fatty’s arm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Liang’s heart nearly jumped out of his chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fortunately, the fatty had a stable hand, so Ye Zichen’s pat didn’t cause him to slice through Zuo Liang’s throat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Emperor Ye, you are right. Uhm… When you have time, can you give me an autograph? I grew up listening to stories about you, I’ve always been your fan,” the fatty said with a nervous blush.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but chuckle, “Of course.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you so much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the blade finally left Zuo Liang’s neck, Zuo Liang let out a huge sigh of relief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, he saw the fatty turn to Ye Zichen for an autograph…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He quickly shot backwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ruan Qingtian saw that he was going to hide back in the barrier again, he called out loudly, “Ye Zichen, don’t let him get in there!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen turned around. He saw that Zuo Liang had taken a few steps back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked at Ruan Qingtian calmly, “Why are you so worked up?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, he…” Ruan Qingtian wasn’t sure of how to explain it. He could only show Ye Zichen by hammering in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, let’s see what you’re going to do now?” Zuo Liang laughed cockily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen reached his hand out and felt the barrier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He pushed against it a few times, then gave up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I really don’t get why you’re so excited. Yes, I can’t get in, but can you come out? All you can do is hide within the barrier. Isn’t that right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Liang froze for a moment. </span><i><span style>That seems to be the case.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Then, his eyes lit up as he saw Zuo Hongde.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zuo Liang, what are you trying to do to my father?” Zuo Mo quickly scolded when she saw Zuo Liang getting ideas about Zuo Hongde.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What I am trying to do?” Zuo Liang smiled sinisterly and slowly walked towards Zuo Hongde with a smirk. “Indeed, I can’t get out, but you can’t come in. Don’t force me. It’s already a great deal for me when I got so many elders and the ex-clan head here with me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zuo Liang.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shut up,” Zuo Liang’s gaze turned cold. He grabbed Zuo Hongde’s throat with bloodshot eyes. “If you don’t want him to die, then obey my command.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen laughed. He shrugged indifferently, only to vex Zuo Liang more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can see that you want him to die. Zuo Mo, don’t blame me for this. Blame Ye Zichen!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, he put more force into his grip…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Liang felt a hand connect with his cheek.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Zuo Liang came back to his senses, he saw that Ye Zichen, who was originally standing outside the barrier, standing right in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I really don’t know why you’re so confident. How’d you know that I can’t get in?”</span></p>
