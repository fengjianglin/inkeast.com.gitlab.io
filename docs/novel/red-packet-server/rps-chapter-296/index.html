 <p><span style>Chapter 296 – Force Established! Name – Tribulation!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Someone is looking for me?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rubbed Liu Qing’s head, then took the phone and saw Xie Bian’s grandson, Xie Lei, was looking for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother, thank you so much!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was the only message on the screen, while a red packet followed it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received Level 3 Ghost Messenger Xie Lei’s red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Heaven and Earth merits x100000.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hundred Ghost Night Walking Sigil x3. It has been added to the Yinyang Box.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your level in the Underworld has increased. Current level: Level 5 Ghost servant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your intimacy level with Xie Lei increased by 400. Current intimacy level: 600.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your intimacy level with Xie Lei leveled up. Current intimacy level: Respected.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received 10 Admiration Points from Xie Lei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Struggle for the Three Realms mode is about to activate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Activation criteria. 1000 Admiration Points in the Heavenly Court and the Underworld, and 500 Reputation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The series of system notification completely stunned Ye Zichen. Meanwhile, Liu Qing also opened her eyes wide for a long while before she spoke, “What are all these? What is the Struggle for the Three Realms?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not sure. It might be that a game updated or something?” Ye Zichen replied in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Ye Zichen disregarded the system notifications, and instead glanced at the title in front of Xie Lei’s name…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Level 3 Ghost Messenger.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>If I remember correctly, he was merely a Level 1 Ghost Messenger a few days ago.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It seems like he got quite a good bit of benefits during Xie Bian’s birthday feast!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Kid, you turned the tables?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Xie Lei was busy dealing with the Underworld staff that had come to visit him. During Xie Bian’s birthday feast, his packet of jasmine tea completely shocked everyone and earned continuous praise from the birthday ‘boy’ Xie Bian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the feast ended, Xie Bian directly gifted him a manor in the Ghost Capital.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The manor was one that Xie Bian had resided in while he was younger. The fact that Xie Bian gave out this manor caused plenty of Underworld staff to guess at Xie Bian’s intentions while they started to get closer to Xie Lei’s side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was something which had never been seen before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Lei shook his head with a soft smile when he saw the group of ghosts that came to him to offer their good will. At that moment, the phone on his table rang. He immediately picked it up, and replied to the message with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I turned the tables, and it was all thanks to Big Brother. I, Xie Lei, am not an ungrateful person. I, Xie Lei, will do as much as I can whenever Big Brother has need of me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, since you said that, I really do have something to trouble you with!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen replied with a soft smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother, please say it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Lei’s eyes were completely serious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I might come to the Underworld in the near future. I will be on unfamiliar grounds then, so please take care of me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Ye Zichen wanted to revive Liu Qing, he definitely had to go to the Underworld once.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He did not know what the situation over there was like either, so he had to be completely prepared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It won’t be me taking care of you, but I will definitely help! Just contact me then!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Lei replied without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, then that’s it. We’ll talk then!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Ye Zichen finished his chat with Xie Lei, Liu Qing snatched his phone. He had wanted to try to figure out what the Struggle for the Three Realms was, but since the girl wanted it that badly, he’d just let her have it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, it’s not like he will get the answer just by studying it a little.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The next day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At Leisure Home.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen arrived in casual clothes. At the place where he entered, a thirty-something years old woman sat at the counter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir, how many will it be?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m looking for Wei Chen!” Ye Zichen said plainly. The woman was confused for a moment before she smiled, “Third floor!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The teahouse had been completely redecorated. Originally, the entire building was a place to drink tea.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, after the improvement, the first and second floor continued to operate as a normal teahouse, while the third floor became the place where they gathered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a stand at the staircase between the second and third floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Non-staff members were prohibited.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, Ye Zichen shook his head with a smile and walked up. At that moment, Wei Chen was playing cards with his subordinates. When he saw Ye Zichen arrive, he immediately chucked the cards away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Ye!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The subordinates did not know Ye Zichen, so they all stood to the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded with a soft smile and glanced at the arrangement of the third floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the sort of effect he wanted it to have.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wanted the base to be hidden within the city, and since the teahouse continued to operate normally, it would not raise the suspicion of others at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha, it’s alright if Boss Ye likes it,” Wei Chen smiled, then raised his eyebrows at the subordinates behind him. “He is our boss from now on. Call him Boss Ye from now on!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Ye!” The subordinates all spoke up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh yeah, Boss Ye, name our organization!” said Wei Chen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen squinted his eyes. The reason he established this power was to block off the troubles and tribulations around him…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ll call it Tribulation!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tribulation. Haha, good name!” Actually Wei Chen did not know how it was a good name, but kissing-ass was a must.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen ignored his compliment and raised his eyebrows, “Old Wei, is everyone in the teahouse one of our people?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm,” Wei Chen nodded, but then quickly shook his head. “No, not everyone. The lady at the front counter isn’t one of our people!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She isn’t?” Ye Zichen was stunned. </span><i><span style>But when I mentioned Wei Chen earlier, the woman smiled meaningfully…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I thought that she was as well.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“That lady was the sales manager of the teahouse before. I had wanted to change her for someone else, but she is rather pitiful. She said that she can’t lose her job and stuff, so I left her behind,” Wei Chen licked his lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rubbish, how can an outsider stay here? What if she finds out?” Ye Zichen frowned. Then he smiled playfully. “You couldn’t have gotten interested in her, right? Would Wei Teng agree?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wei Chen instantly blushed, “Boss Ye, you really know how to crack jokes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This isn’t a joking matter. As an outsider, she will have an impact on us. Can you promise that she won’t ever find out anything?” solemnity filled Ye Zichen’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uhm… I’ll find a chance to speak to her!” Wei Chen sighed, then changed the topic. “Let me tell you about the strength of our members!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, he called over a thin man with a plain hairstyle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is my ex-assistant. He’s a mid satge False Earth Immortal. He’s called Dahua!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Ye!” Dahuo smiled with a nod.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“These…” Wei Chen pointed to approximately fifteen people behind him. “Spiritual Body level!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, he pointed at the remaining twenty something people at the back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“False Spiritual Level.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded. Although these people were not particularly strong, they were irreplaceable aid for the current Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What about the intelligence gathering group?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The intelligence personnel aren’t here!” Wei Chen smiled. “If they keep on sitting here, then what sort of intel are we supposed to look at. Am I right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right!” Ye Zichen nodded in satisfaction and smiled. “Then I’ll give you your first mission. Help me investigate the whereabouts of a man named Huo Da. If he is in Bingcheng, then send some people to protect those around me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With those simple orders, Ye Zichen walked down from the third floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he arrived on the first floor of the teahouse, he intentionally looked towards the lady at the counter. As he walked past her, she suddenly spoke…</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Original Chapter Teaser:</b>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Ahh, I've finally finished all the preparations. The stuff that the Yellow Emperor's reincarnation has asked me to do has finally been done.</p>
 <p>That being said, it really wasn't too much trouble, it was basically just gathering everyone under my wing, checking up on how strong they are, telling them to move to the new base, and briefing them on Young Master Ye's decision. They were mostly alright with it as well. Thank god they do trust me and my judgement, otherwise, I would have no idea as to how to convince them.</p>
 <p>I can see how our organization is going to be really awesome from now on. Under the leadership of the Yellow Emperor, which organization wouldn't be amazing and reach the top?</p>
 <p>Sure, I get it, as the reincarnation of such a great person, he is definitely going to have to go through trials and tribulations, and preventing these trouble from reaching his family is definitely going to be one of our tasks. But still, after we go through all that, we'll be at the top. Like the very top.</p>
 <p>What's more, it is only fitting that I, the... Basically, it is only befitting for me to reach the position of the top beneath the Yellow Emperor with my identity.</p>
