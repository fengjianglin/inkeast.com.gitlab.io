 <p><span style>Chapter 618 – Chancellor of the Grand Secretariat</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Heavenly Court was truly a complete mess.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Seven Fairies were jeopardized during their concert and Heavenly King Li, a higher-up, was poisoned. However, Jade Emperor, the lord of the realm, continued to enjoy himself and simply disregarded everything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the very beginning, he did try and help the Seven Fairies seek the culprit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, now, he just kept the Seven Fairies by his side and had them host private concerts for him. As for the Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King Li….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’ll be fine with Old Lord Taishang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those were the Jade Emperor’s exact words...</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it was previously, Taibai Jinxing might have been able to handle the situation. Yet, because Taibai Jinxing was gone, the Heavenly Court truly did seem to be in a leaderless situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although there was God of Thunder, Mother of Lightning, Canopy Marshal and Erlang Shen…</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were masters at fighting and warfare, but when it came to handling internal affairs…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Heh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was why the fairy had something so worrisome in the group earlier. What she had said was only the tip of the iceberg. The truth was, that plenty of people in the Heavenly Court worried and made their own guesses in private. The only difference was that they didn’t display their opinion in public.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Ye Zichen’s strict and powerful words resonated with them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What they needed was someone who can give them orders and tell them what to do next.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s phone practically exploded. There were endless rings with the system notification bar continuously refreshing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sudhanakumara’s intimacy level increased by 100.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Golden Boy’s intimacy level increased by 100.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jade Girl’s intimacy level increased by 100.</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>Profound Lady of the Nine Heavens’<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> intimacy level increased by 100.</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The notification bar was filled with notifications of the deities’ intimacy level increasing. Ye Zichen gripped his phone in surprise as he watched the scrolling notifications.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>My random words just now actually managed to win over those deities?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Improving my intimacy level with them is way too easy!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, it wasn’t that simple. The reason why his words had such a huge impact was mainly due to everything he had done before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sky Sovereign.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was an extremely honorable title in the Heavenly Court. All those with that title were existences at the very top of the pyramid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Furthermore…</span></p>
 <p><span style>His name had spread far and wide in the Heavenly Court. Many smaller deities all admired and worshipped his mysteriousness, while other more major deities would heard of his title knew who it referred to, even if they didn’t know who he is.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All their food, clothes and daily products came from him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The situation was like a small bamboo. It may only grow a few centimeters within a few years, but when its roots spread far and wide enough, it would be able to grow ten-odd meters in a few short weeks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen did find himself fereling rather smug when he felt the support of so many deities.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>But I can’t exactly just directly replace the Jade Emperor. No matter what, he’s already been the head of the Heavenly Court for several hundred thousand years and is in the group himself…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t stay stuff like that. The Jade Emperor is still the Jade Emperor, I’m merely his subordinate. He naturally is capable as the master of all. Do not say anything like that anymore. Otherwise, I will not be merciful!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nezha: &lt;insert a tongue out emoji&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Sky Sovereign, please cease your anger. Nezha is young, so he doesn’t think about what he says, so don’t take offence. But what do you think we should do? Right now, we do need someone who can command the deities in the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Fortune: Yeah. Sky Sovereign, what do you think we should do? We are truly leaderless right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: I won’t accept others giving orders, but I definitely agree with Sky Sovereign doing that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mother of Lightning: +1.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Barefoot Immortal: Technically, I shouldn’t interfere with the affairs of the Heavenly Court, but the Heavenly Court does require someone who can command everyone right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Profound Lady of the Ninth Heaven: Ahem, allow me to interrupt you all for a moment!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: What a rare guest!</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Fortune: Apologies for not giving a welcome for your arrival, Profound Lady! Hurry up, sound the music...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal immediately sent a voice message with songs about him playing in the background.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: Profound Lady, you wanna go out?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Profound Lady of the Ninth Heaven: Stop messing around. I came here to pass along a message from the Jade Emperor and Queen Mother.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone grew silent once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nobody said anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Profound Lady of the Nine Heavens wasn’t surprised when she saw this. It was rather easy to understand why the deities were acting like that. They were just saying bad things about the Jade Emperor, so they all went to hide.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for the others…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Perhaps they were just snorting at the Jade Emperor’s extremely late orders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: Ahem. Profound Lady, please speak. We’ve been waiting for the Jade Emperor’s orders for a long time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Profound Lady of the Nine Heavens: The Jaded Emperor has decreed that Sky Sovereign Nameless understands him greatly and is truly loyal to the Heavenly Court. Thus, he has ordered me to decree that Sky Sovereign Nameless shall become the Heavenly Court’s Chancellor of the Grand Secretariat to handle all Heavenly Court matters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye ZIchen was completely shocked when he saw the message.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So… I’m in power now?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Before he could truly realize what was going on, the Profound Lady of the Nine Heavens sent him a red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received Profound Lady of the Nine Heavens’s red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jade Emperor’s Token.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jade Emperor’s Token: A token of the Jade Emperor, the Master of the Six Hwalls.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, congratulations. The future of the Heavenly Court will be relying on you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the Profound Lady of the Nine Heavens sent him the message, Ye Zichen was already dumbstruck. </span><i><span style>He gave me his f*cking token as well? Is he not afraid of me starting a revolution?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Or is this the Jade Emperor’s way of testing me?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“This is no good. I’ve gotten used to being carefree. I am truly worried to take upon such an important position!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, there is no need for you to worry,” Profound Lady of the Nine Heavens replied. “Actually, the Queen Mother has been paying close attention to the group and only asked the Jade Emperor after she saw what you said earlier. When the Jade Emperor heard that, he immediately agreed without thinking. It’s clear that he trusts you deeply.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that so!?” Ye Zichen replied with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let me tell you something in secret, but don’t tell others,” Profound Lady of the Nine Heavens said mysteriously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Actually, the Queen Mother has a slight problem with the Jade Emperor’s recent way of management, she has been feeling that you are more suitable to handle things. The Conference of the Three Realms will begin in approximately a year, she hopes that during that time, you… You understand, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was once again shocked when he saw this message.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Uhm…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Overthrow him, huh.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Although the system had been plotting all this, Ye Zichen was still a bit frantic when someone from the Heavenly Court mentioned that to him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The Jade Emperor has been the master of the Heavenly Court for several hundred thousand years, are we really going to overthrow him?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s more, the six halls of the Heavenly Court all work together. It’s not going to be that simple.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Profound Lady, please don’t speak recklessly,” Ye Zichen replied carefully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems like Sky Sovereign is an understanding person. Her Majesty said that we shall see if it is reckless talk. Do not let others know of this conversation. It is enough that you, Her Majesty and I know about this! Alright, I have to go and get skincare with Her Majesty, bye bye!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bye…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen replied with a long sigh, while feeling even more shocked.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It seems like the Jade Emperor’s foolishness has reached a new high, otherwise, the Queen Mother wouldn’t have sent the Profound Lady of the Nine Heavens to tell me all that.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Head of the Heavenly Court…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>If I really get a chance, I guess I should try it out!</span></i></p>
