 <p><span style>Chapter 42 – How can a ghost girl be so cute</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen followed Xiao Hai up to the second floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Man Xiao lay on the bed with a pale expression. He exhaled much more than he inhaled, it seemed like he was about to suffocate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I angered him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guilt flashed across Xiao Hai’s eye, causing Ye Zichen to sneer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You truly came to Old Man Xiao’s room just now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Hai wanted to explain, but Ye Zichen waved his hand, signaling him that there was no need to.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The blood on the ground had not dried yet, it was nearly black. That wasn’t the blood that a normal person would cough up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most importantly, Ye Zichen felt like this room had a heavy yin aura about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen already felt the sinister aura in the living room, but when he walked into Old Man Xiao’s room, he noticed that the yin aura actually came from here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi, look, my grandpa…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Xiao Hai saw Ye Zichen wander around in the room without even looking at Old Man Xiao’s condition, he became extremely anxious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen put his finger on his mouth to indicate for him to be quiet and scanned the room continuously with faint golden eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Burn this painting!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pointed to the painting at head of Old Man Xiao’s bed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is something treasured by my grandfather. I can’t make the decision.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I’m not going to save him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shrugged then prepared to walk out. Xiao Hai clenched his teeth and said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, I’ll burn it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want it burnt now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Hai clenched his teeth, then took down the painting and burnt it in front of Ye Zichen. Only then did Ye Zichen smile in satisfaction, then he moved his right hand back and clenched his fist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, I’ll be going now. Prepare a car for me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Leaving? Then my-my grandpa…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’ll be fine in a moment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled meaningfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Hai instantly understood. Actually Old Man Xiao did not cough up blood due to being angered, it was due to that painting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But he was unable to understand why.</span></p>
 <p><span style> After getting on, Xiao Hai wanted to get the driver to send him back, but Ye Zichen refused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen was about to leave the Xiao family, he rolled down the windows and raised his eyebrows towards Xiao Hai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Remember, you owe me an explanation. Also, your family’s old man will wake up after I leave, hurry up and accompany him. Tell him that I don’t like to be tricked.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the car started and left, Xiao Hai stood in the doorway for a long time.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ye Zichen actually knew everything.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It really was as Ye Zichen had said. Old Man Xiao opened his eyes after he left the estate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Hai sat beside the bed and helped the old man up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandpa, are you okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Ye saved me again?” A flash of helplessness flashed across Old Man Xiao’s eyes. Hearing that, Xiao Hai nodded, “Yes, Lil’ Ye told me to burn the painting at the head of your bed. He also told me to tell you that he doesn’t like to be tricked.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Painting?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Man Xiao hurriedly looked up. Very soon, he unenergetically dipped his head once again and patted Xiao Hai’s shoulders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re right, he really is very much like Old Gu. I won’t interfere between the two of you. Go on now, I’m tired, I want to rest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Xiao Hai left the room, Old Man Xiao sat up once again, and sighed as he looked at the blank space above the head of the bed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Gu, in the end, someone burnt the painting you wanted to burn back then!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Ye Zichen left the Xiao family, he acted very weirdly. He continuously drove with one hand, while forming a fist with another.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let go of me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A cute yell suddenly sounded out within the near-empty car.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait a moment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled playfully, then let go of his hand after locking all the doors and windows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How can you see me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a girl in a light blue floral dress floating near the top of Ye Zichen’s car.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ignore the reason of why I can see you. I’m just curious, what’s your grudge with that old man?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He pissed off Grandpa Gu.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandpa Gu?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows? “Grandpa Gu is a person?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm, a living person,” the ghost girl nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He could see you as well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, Grandpa Gu was very nice to me,” When the girl mentioned Grandpa Gu, she actually smiled. “Oh yeah, why did you burn that painting?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t you know that the painting was absorbing your yin aura? It is a evil item, wouldn’t I burn it instead of keep it?” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes at her and said. “Why didn’t you go and reincarnate after you died? What are you wandering around for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can’t,” The girl revealed a hint of depression. “I died before my time was up. The underworld isn’t accepting me. I can only wander around like this until my time in the world of the living is up, then go and reincarnate.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Died before her time was up.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>This was too shocking, if it wasn’t because Ye Zichen had even become sworn brothers with a deity, he really might have been shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, this ghost girl was quite pitiful, she actually died randomly before her time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And she can’t even reincarnate, and could only wander around the human world like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what are you going to do?” Ye Zichen felt a sense of pity. If there was anything he could help the ghost girl with, he was going to.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know either,” The female girl dipped her head helplessly and played around with the edges of her floral skirt. “When Grandpa Gu was here, the Xiao family was the place of my belonging. However, ever since Grandpa Gu left, I lost my home.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How about you come with me?” Ye Zichen touched his chin. Seeing that, the girl frowned, “Why would I follow you, you are obviously a bad person? Are you lusting after my beauty, and want to do something to me… I’m telling you, I’m a ghost…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have a delusion about rape!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes at her in annoyance. She’s a ghost, and he was human. </span><i><span style>Lusting after her beauty?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, to be fair, that ghost girl did look quite good.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The female girl leaped towards Ye Zichen. In Ye Zichen’s imagination, ghost girls should look terrifying with a green face and fangs. However, to be perfectly honest, this girl was actually kind of cute when she was angry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his arm and grabbed her wrist, then chucked her towards the top of the car.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have the teachings of the Great Sage, you can’t beat me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re bullying me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ghost girl started sobbing while she floated in the car. Seeing that, Ye Zichen blushed.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is she really a f*cking ghost!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>If she is, then why is she crying!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>And she had to be so cute!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, it was my mistake, stop crying,” Ye Zichen raised his hand and pulled the ghost girl down to the front passenger seat. “See if there is anything you can possess on my body. At least you won’t be bullied if you follow me. Furthermore, I know some people, I might drink a few glasses of wine with Yama one day, and he’ll let you reincarnate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re lying!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who’s lying,” Ye Zichen took out his phone and opened the chat group. “You can read, right? Look at who is in the group.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nezha, Canopy General, God of Thunder…”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ha.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The ghost girl suddenly laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you laughing for!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the first time Ye Zichen shared his secret, and this ghost girl actually laughed at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re all crazy!”</span></p>
