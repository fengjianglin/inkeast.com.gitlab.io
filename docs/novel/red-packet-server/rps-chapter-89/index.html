 <p><span style>Chapter 89 – Reunion</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan sat in the front passenger seat. The phrase of “people relied on their clothes and horses relied on their saddles” applied to anyone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan always dressed very casually in school.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For this reunion, she intentionally dressed herself up and put on a faint bit of makeup.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, the goddess was promoted to the level of an angel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, the reason she put on makeup wasn’t the reunion, it was purely for Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Girls dress themselves up for the people they like.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She didn’t put too much importance on this reunion, she merely wanted Ye Zichen to pay more attention to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fortunately, her wish had been granted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the moment Su Yan called out to Ye Zichen, his sights had been fixed on her visage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan was very happy when she felt the gaze of the man beside her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did my grandpa and you talk about, you guys started chatting the moment you came over.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan tucked her hair behind her ear, causing Ye Zichen to swallow hard and laugh, “What else? He just said that he wanted to get a grandson quicker. Do you think that Old Man Su is implying that I should take you quickly?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk, grandpa wouldn’t say that,” Su Yan snorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re still not believing me? You, the granddaughter, should know what Old Man Su is like so much more than I, the grandson-in-law,” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows and chuckled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m going to ignore you,” Su Yan lowered her head with a blush then played with the corner of her clothes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>According to her understanding of Old Man Su, he might actually say something like that.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could grandpa really have said that to Ye Zichen?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Then…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, Su Yan was beyond embarrassed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The location of Su Yan’s reunion with her classmates was in a high-class business club. Apparently that Young Master Bai had booked the whole venue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at the cars parked outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were several Audi and BMWs. There was even a Ferrari.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So these people were pretty rich.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen didn’t think that mockingly, it was sincere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was already considered very amazing for university students to own an Audi A or BMW X.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen randomly found a place to park, then noticed that his car was unusually eye-catching.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen silently commented that he shouldn’t listen to the shitty advice from Xiao Hai. At the same time, he walked over to Su Yan’s car door and opened it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go, my princess.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, a lot of people were already standing within the club, the reunion was rather similar to a cocktail party. Everyone held a glass of red wine or champagne, while they chatted about some sort of high-end topic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Plenty of these people brought male or female partners, while there were quite a few outstanding-looking girls within these female partners.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, everyone inside instantly turned plain when Su Yan entered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All the men in the club were awestruck by Su Yan, while the surrounding girls frowned in displeasure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her arrival had stolen all of the gazes they were enjoing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, Su Yan came.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A path opened within the crowd at the center of the room. Not long later, an extremely cute looking girl holding hands with an extremely honest looking young man ran towards Ye Zichen and Su Yan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Su Yan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Su Yan also looked up, and her beautiful eyes were filled with joy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lin Ru.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two girls instantly held hands and started chatting, leaving their male partners to the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen and the young man looked at each other with an awkward smile, then he walked in front of the young man and stretched out his hand with a smile, “Ye Zichen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man politely wiped his hands with a handkerchief when he saw Ye Zichen reach out his hand, then shook it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wu Haoyu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the two introduced themselves, Ye Zichen immediately used his natural talent for getting familiar with people and put his arm on the other person’s shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s your girlfriend?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kind of, I’m still pursuing her,” Wu Haoyu scratched his head honestly. At that moment, Su Yan and Lin Ru suddenly thought of their male partners, but when they saw the two men, they couldn’t help but giggle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The two of them sure know how to get along.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ru giggled. When she noticed the way Su Yan looked towards Ye Zichen, she raised her hand and tickled Su Yan with a naughty smile, “Susu, that’s your boyfriend, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm,” Su Yan blushed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ru immediately showed an expression of shock, “Wow, the school beauty actually found a boyfriend!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan didn’t continue down that topic trail. She looked towards the young man beside Ye Zichen, “That one’s your boyfriend, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ru blushed and pouted, “No way. That person’s such an idiot, I wouldn’t like someone like him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>While she spoke, she waved her fist towards Wu Haoyu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Coincidentally, Wu Haoyu also looked over. When Lin Ru saw him, he immediately honestly laughed and scratched his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Look at him, he looks so dumb,” Lin Ru stomped her foot in anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan couldn’t help but giggle, “He’s rather suited to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the four of them got together again, Su Yan kept holding Ye Zichens’ arm like a little woman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In contrast, on Lin Ru and Wu Haoyu’s side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Haoyu stayed right by Lin Ru’s side without daring to say anything, but his gaze never left her side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Su Yan, you came.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A loud voice sounded out while Ye Zichen and co. chatted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen and co. looked around and saw a young man in a suit with really waxed hair, walk towards them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gao Chang, who had invited Su Yan to the reunion the other day, was also by his side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bai Yang, he’s still so disgusting,” Lin Ru twitched her mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Su Yan’s expression also turned dark.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s that Young Master Bai?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm, Su Yan confirmed."</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Su Yan, why didn’t you say anything when you came. I…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Yan’s smile instantly tensed when he saw Su Yan wrap her arms around Ye Zichen’s arm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ru snickered, “Young Master Bai, what happened. Your expression seems terrible, do you need me to call an ambulance for you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Haoyu pulled on Lin Ru, signaling her to save some face for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This caused Lin Ru to hide her mocking expression and stand beside Su Yan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen merely looked at the changes on Bai Yan’s face without saying anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a long time, Bai Yan calmed himself down, checked out Ye Zichen and reach out his hand in a look of disdain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bai Yan, Su Yan’s pursuer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bai Yan, don’t say that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan was instantly annoyed. Ye Zichen patted her hands and reached his hand over with a nod.</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>“Aries<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>? Do the upper class introduce themselves with their horoscopes now? Hello, I’m Cancer, Su Yan’s current boyfriend. It seems like our horoscopes oppose each other quite a bit, no wonder we’re rivals in love.”</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>He.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ru couldn’t hold it in and laughed again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Susu, your boyfriend is so funny.”</span></p>
