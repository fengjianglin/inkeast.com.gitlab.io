 <p><span style>“What did you say?” Song An’s expression immediately turned cold as he snorted with a mocking smile. “Little fellow, this is not a place for you to act out of line!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then is this a place for you to act out of line?” Ye Zichen smiled. “I was merely telling Gramps to choose doctors properly. What? You aren’t letting people speak their mind now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Deng Cheng suddenly reached his hand out towards Song An…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry, Mr. Song. I feel like you are unable to work with our hospital anymore. I hope you will find a way out in other hospitals.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Deng’s words completely shocked Song An.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Elder Deng, are you kidding? Just because of what this brat said, you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I believe in Lil’ Ye’s words,” Deng Cheng smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Song An couldn’t help but cursed with a frown, “Foolish old man!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can I interpret that as you cursing me?” Deng Cheng’s expression suddenly turned cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei also snickered on the side, “Mr. Song, your words just now have caused huge troubles for me. I will tell my lawyer to send you a lawyer letter later.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zeze, lawyer letter? Sorry, I’m American!” Song An sneered with a snort, as he said with a tone full of disdain. “Just a bunch like you want to sue me? Do you even dare?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So cocky!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen directly kicked Song An to the ground. Then, he squinted his eyes with a snort, “We’re not only going to sue you, we even beat you up. So what? You gonna find the American Consulate to punish me? Seriously, instead of being a good Huaxia citizen, you started to act cocky just because you’re an American now. Don’t forget, this is Huaxia!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mr. Ye,” the waiter was unsure of what to do, and the restaurant owner also gulped after he rushed over.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The people that are fighting are important figures. I can’t afford to offend any of them!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t mind too much, if he really dares to sue anyone, tell him to sue me. I am Ye Zichen, the Chairman of Maintaining Beauty Corporation. I await your lawyer letter. I will accompany you until the very end no matter what saw of lawsuit you want to get into!” Ye Zichen smiled, then sneered at Song An, who was lying on the ground. “Remember, I’m called Ye Zichen. Come, punish me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, before leaving, he couldn’t help but to kick Song An once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, nobody noticed the smile on Song An’s face when Ye Zichen did that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After getting up from the ground, he acted furiously as if he was going to go to the consulate, but the moment he left the restaurant, he took out his phone and smiled sinisterly, “Master, Plan A has succeeded!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After leaving that restaurant, Ye Zichen and co. went to another one nearby.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After they sat down, Deng Cheng finally raised his eyebrows, “Lil’ Ye, why did you tell me not to use Song An earlier? It seems like you two have a bit of a grudge?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fact that Deng Cheng supported him without any conditions made Ye Zichen very happy. </span><i><span style>I guess helping this Gramps deal with all those troubles wasn’t a waste after all.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“It isn’t really a grudge…” Ye Zichen let out a sigh, then spoke about the incident on the plane, and told Deng Cheng about what had occurred in the restaurant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s lucky that I didn’t let him work in the hospital. Otherwise, someone like that definitely would have a bad effect on our hospital,” Deng Cheng replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Liu Qianqian, who sat beside him did not say anything, and merely played with her chopsticks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lucy, why aren’t you speaking?” Ye Zichen teased when he saw Liu Qianqian’s quite appearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qianqian immediately rolled her eyes, “Seriously!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Deng Cheng couldn’t help but chuckle when he saw them. Then he turned towards Ye Zichen once again, “Lil’ Ye, do you remember what I promised you when we went to help take a look at Old Lin?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrow in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Deng Cheng chuckled, “Didn’t I say that I’ll introduce you to my granddaughter? This is my granddaughter Liu Qianqian… How is she, the two of you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahem!” Ye Zichen suddenly coughed intensely, while Liu Qianqian also blushed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandpa!” Liu Qianqian hammered Deng Cheng’s shoulders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he merely chuckled once more, “Lil’ Ye’s medical abilities definitely make him worthy of you. What? Are you not satisfied?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei maintained a faint smile as she stood on the side. She did not reveal any sense of displeasure or acceptance. Ye Zichen’s heart jumped. </span><i><span style>This Gramps…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>He’s screwing me over!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen doubted that someone as old as Deng Cheng would be unable tell his relationship with Xiao Yumei. What’s more, he also had that Huang Shengmei in the hospital…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This Gramps probably knows, but why is he still doing this?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>He’s definitely trying to screw me over.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but retort in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Deng Cheng’s face was covered with a faint smile, “Lil’ Ye, how about it…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then… Can we talk about this topic some other time?" Ye Zichen smiled wryly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Deng Cheng nodded, “Sure, my granddaughter just gets embarrassed easily. Make sure to keep in contact in private!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandpa!” Liu Qianqian called out again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did Deng Cheng grab a pork knuckle and raise his eyebrows, “Mm, this restaurant’s pork knuckle is pretty good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen and Xiao Yumei got into the car once again, Ye Zichen focused on her expression, and wondered about how he was supposed to explain it to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need to explain to me. I will be by your side regardless of how many women you have.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yumei, that Gramps was just screwing me over. That geezer’s really crafty, god only knows what ploy he’s crafting,” Ye Zichen smiled coyly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Perhaps, but don’t mind so much. I’ll send you back to the mansion. Since Tiantian wants to stay with me these two days, I’ll stay at your place as well,” Xiao Yumei nodded. Then suddenly said. “Actually, never mind, I’ll take Tiantian back to my place. What if I affect you picking up girls!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please stop teasing me!” Ye Zichen shrugged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei also giggled and stopped talking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they arrived back in the mansion, Mother Ye immediately grabbed Xiao Yumei away to chat, while Ye Zichen sat down on the sofa and hooked his fingers at Lil’ White.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ White immediately glanced over at the second floor, then shot over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How’s it going?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>For the past few days, Ye Zichen had been waiting for Lil’ White to finish. The moment Lil’ White confirms the location, then he’ll charge over…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The demons must be killed in their cradle!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve already located them,” Lil’ White smiled proudly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately lifted Lil’ White up by his two front legs, “Lil’ White, I will remember this achievement. Tell me, where are they!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can’t tell you!” Lil’ White suddenly shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately revealed a confused expression. “Why not!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Because I don’t want you to go and die!”</span></p>
