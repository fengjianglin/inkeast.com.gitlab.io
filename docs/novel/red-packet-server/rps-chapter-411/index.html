 <p><span style>Chapter 411 – Farewell</span></p>
 <p><span style>A silver airflow spiraled around Wei Chen. At that moment, he was like a beastman with his silver hair flowing in the air as he gazed at the surrounding giant abyssals.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In the name of the light, be cleansed!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoosh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A piercing light immediately appeared in the area with Wei Chen at the center.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The surrounding strange birds and slime monsters immediately turned to ash when they came into contact with this light, while the three humanoid monsters also clutched their heads and screamed…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Resistance is futile!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Three spheres of light suddenly appeared in Wei Chen’s claws, which he flung towards the chest of the abyssals.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Coarse screams sounded out from the abyssals. Then, their bodies gradually shrunk and became just like a normal person’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, when Wei Chen saw the appearance of the three, his expression immediately froze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Ye Zichen also hurried over to where Wei Chen was. He raised his eyebrows when he saw Wei Chen’s appearance, then, when he saw the other three…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop kidding me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen subconsciously took a step back, while the three abyssals looked over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they saw Ye Zichen, the muscular young man instantly clenched his chest, and said with a struggle, “Ye-zi…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kang Peng!” Ye Zichen bit his lips and ran over. The three abyssals in front of him were his three roommates remaining in the dorm… “Why, you guys…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi, just give us a swift end,” Bai Yu patted Ye Zichen’s shoulder, then smiled wryly. “We don’t want to turn into what we were just now. Since you are here… Set us free!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop kidding me!” Ye Zichen glared at them, then grabbed them by their shoulders. “Telling us to set you guys free? That’s too irresponsible. Think about your family, they…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry up!” Bai Yu roared. He continuously patted his head with indescribable agony. “I can’t control myself for much longer. Instead of dying in someone else’s hands, I’d rather you, Ye-zi, send us off on our way!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No… No…” Ye Zichen’s voice trembled as he shook his head and stepped backwards.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Telling me to kill them? Stop kidding me.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn’t we say that we’re going to be friends for life? If you guys leave so irresponsibly, then what about me!?” Tears flowed uncontrollably from Ye Zichen’s eyes. He turned back and grabbed Wei Chen by the collar and knitted his eyebrows. “Tell me, is there any way to turn them back. Is there…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wei Chen merely shook his head emotionlessly in response to Ye Zichen’s question, “No!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Creak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clenched his fist tightly. Bai Yu and co. squatted painfully on the ground as their consciousness started to blue, and purple light flashed in their eyes…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I-I can’t!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stood in front of them with clenched fist. At that moment, as long as he used a bit of force, he would be able to set Bai Yu and co. free.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>But, how can I?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry up and end them while they are still conscious. Setting them free right now is the best thing for them. If they return to their abyssal form, then even I might not be able to deal with them,” Wei Chen said on the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Bai Yu and co. also yelled out painfully, “Ye-zi!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smashed the ground with his fist, then stood up and slowly walked in front of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The three of them smiled faintly as if they were at ease with finally being able to be set free. The ice edge in Ye Zichen’s hand fell to the ground, while his fist emitted a gold light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong. Dong. Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s fist pierced the three chests without any hesitation, while they retained their smiles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi, thank you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The three of them fell onto the ground at the same time, and passed on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen kneeled onto the ground, wept painfully while holding their corpses. Nobody could understand just what it felt like to kill one’s own best friends.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As droplets of tears flowed down his face…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smashed the ground, causing a huge pit to appear. He silently placed the three of them into the pit, then wiped away his tears and stood up from the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whoever is behind all this, I will never… ever let you off!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zeze, he is truly merciless for killing his own roommates!” a cold and playful laughter sounded out, as a top-hat wearing man smiled with a cold smile and shook his head at the scenario.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I already did what you asked me to, so can you turn me back into a normal person now?” Zhu Yunbai knitted his eyebrows and said softly to the man. Bai Yu and co. were only corrupted by his doing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe… Is this the tone you should take with me?” the man smiled coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhu Yunbai instantly kneeled on the ground and kowtowed. “My lord, please let me go. I won’t tell anyone anything. I just want to be a normal person!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yo, I nearly forgot if you didn’t say it,” the man raised his eyebrows, while he smile mockingly. “If I let you go, then all of this might actually be leaked!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhu Yunbai immediately kowtowed continuously and begged, “Please let me go. I will definitely not utter even half a word of what I know.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh? My shoes are a bit dirty…” the man suddenly lifted his foot. Zhu Yunbai immediately kneeled down and crawled over without thinking and begun to lick his shoes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hahahaha…” the man laughed recklessly and looked indifferently at Zhu Yunbai, whose face was filled with anticipation…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man kicked him aside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry, you have no use anymore… As for letting you go. I feel like only a dead person’s mouth is truly tight.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…” Zhu Yunbai’s pupils contracted. He crawled up from the ground and charged towards Guo Jing. “You bitch, it’s all you, all because of you… Since laozi’s going to die, then die with laozi!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In front of me…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A huge bloody hole appeared on his chest before Zhu Yunbai reached Guo Jing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen-ge, Boss Kang Peng… I… was wrong,” Zhu Yunbai looked at the people in front of him with sadness, then fell limply onto the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are still not moved when you watched your roommate die like that?” the man suddenly looked up into the sky with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, Ye Zichen descended down, and stared straight at him…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zeze, don’t look at me like that. Look at how nice I am to you, he died the same way as your other roommates.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Creak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clenched his fist tightly, as terrifying flames of rage burned in his squinted eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gu Li, you pissed me off!”</span></p>

 <p><i>In the next chapter of Red Packet Server...</i></p>
 <p>Wei Chen calls forth a manifestation of the White Tiger, one of the Four Sacred Beasts, to aid them. As a beast worthy of its title, it was naturally able to slaughter countless low leveled abyssals, and also fight against the humanoid abyssals.</p>
 <p>However, was everything going to be that easy?</p>
 <p>After all, the sudden appearance of such a huge army of abyssals... Someone must be behind it right? They should have expected Ye Zichen to come and deal with it, so what exactly has he prepared for Ye Zichen? What exactly is his purpose?</p>
 <p>Is he a new enemy? Or an old foe?</p>
