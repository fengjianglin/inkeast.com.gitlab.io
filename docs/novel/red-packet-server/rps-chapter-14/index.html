 <p><span style>Chapter 14 – It’s all Yue Lao’s fault</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao sent a friend request!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the second deity that had sent Ye Zichen a friend request.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen thought about the marriage string in the Treasure Chest, it seemed like he had received it due to Yue Lao.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Add!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Fellow daoist!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao instantly sent him a message after Ye Zichen added him as a friend.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did Yue Lao find this little deity for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I wonder if fellow daoist was able to receive the marriage string?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It truly was Yue Lao’s fault.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen thought silently in his heart, and gazed at the intimacy level between him and Yue Lao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>100.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After seeing that, he put down the boulder of worry in his heart. Since their intimacy level was friendly, then Ye Zichen didn’t need be worried about any issues.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This little deity had already received Yue Lao’s marriage string. Thank you, Yue Lao.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s no big deal, this old man had merely tied the strings and established the affability between fellow daoist and her. It still requires fellow daoist to work hard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao’s manner of speaking was a complete contrast to the Monkey King. If the Monkey King was speaking like this, then…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hehe, interesting!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I still have to thank Yue Lao for tying the strings!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There is a phrase that is very well said!</span></p>
 <p><span style>One who is unaccountably solicitous is hiding evil intentions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao had to tie so many strings together each day, he clearly had a purpose by finding him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Ye Zichen expected, not long after he said that, Yue Lao replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This old man had just returned from the Great Sage’s place…”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He wants a private red packet!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Although Yue Lao had said it in a very roundabout manner, since he mentioned the Great Sage, then he clearly knew a bit about Ye Zichen from the Great Sage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thinking about what he had on hand and Yue Lao’s age…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He scanned the packet of Yuxi cigarettes in his hand and sent it over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao received your red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fellow daoist, I wonder what kind of item this is!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is something that this little deity…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen blabbered to Yue Lao for a long while, then scanned and sent a lighter over as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yue Lao, both of these items are rare items. You must not let the other fellow deities know. This little deity does not have any left to send to the other fellow deities!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s fine, that’s fine!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your intimacy level with Yue Lao increased by 50. Current intimacy level is 150, it is 50 away from Trusted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A packet of cigarettes increased the intimacy level by 50 points, this was really a lot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They say gifting goes both ways, since fellow daoist has sent this old man such a valuable item, this old man naturally cannot be petty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A red packet appeared on his screen.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Look!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>This is what it means to be understanding. Just look at Yue Lao!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Gifting goes both ways…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Great Sage Sun just wanted some respect, this Yue Lao knows how to return red packets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clicked open on the red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Received Yue Lao’s red packet, Three Pure Blessed Jade Pendant x1.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is a jade pendant that this old man got the Three Pure Ones to bless earlier. It can keep fellow daoist safe.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you, Yue Lao.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen impatiently withdrew the jade pendant and put it on. All of a sudden, a freshness surged through his entire body, causing his pores to open up.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Good stuff.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but smile when he looked at Yue Lao and the Monkey King, who were listed in his WeChat contacts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This is just the beginning, if a lot more people add him in the future…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then wouldn’t the Heavenly Court…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Drink soft drinks, smoke cigarettes and play mahjong…</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was very interesting just thinking about that!</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen had returned to the dorm, his roommates were playing League of Legends together. After refusing his roommates’ invite, Ye Zichen washed himself simply, then laid on the bed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t say anything to anyone the entire night.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everybody get up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A lion-like roar sounded out through the dorm. All of the people in the room opened his eyes, and he saw Zhang Rui shout, while holding his phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you screaming for, can’t you let people sleep!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why should we sleep, the goddess cheated!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, everyone in the room had lost their sleepiness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The goddess Zhang Rui talked about was Su Yan. The meaning of cheated was referring to the fact their goddess was no longer single and cheated in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damn, laozi wants to see who dared to chat up the goddess!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s heart couldn’t help but beat wildly, the person there couldn’t be him, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen peeked at the picture, and the familiar scene caused him to feel troubled. He said a few words to his roommates before frantically running out of the dorm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait a minute, the person here…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s Fifth bro!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chase after him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was unknown who shouted it, but everyone in the room ran out to chase after Ye Zichen in only their boxers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Susu, there are rumors about you on the school net.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Keke’s eyes burned with the flames of gossip, while she smiled at Su Yan as they walked towards the canteen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The man in that picture there is that controversial figure.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s all just rumors.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan blushed for some reason, while Keke smiled playfully. Just at that moment, her eyes suddenly brightened and waved towards someone in front of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, Riche Bro.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment, Ye Zichen’s roommates were attemtping to kidnap him towards the canteen. He knew something bad was going to happen if he got caught by them, so he ran on ahead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unfortunately, Kang Peng was a sports student, so it was all too easy when they really wanted to catch him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With no other choice, he could only be threatened by them into treating them to a breakfast.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi, it sounds like they’re calling you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kang Peng suddenly hit Ye Zichen, while everyone else also looked over at the sound of the voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“School beauty Xia Keke. The one beside her is… the goddess!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhang Rui pushed up his glasses frame without any lenses. Ye Zichen also raised his head and saw that Su Yan was looking his way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both of them randomly blushed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Riche Bro, what a coincidence.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke forcefully pulled on Su Yan’s arm and walked over. Ye Zichen sneaked a peek at Su Yan, but when he heard what Xiao Keke had called him, he was completely confused.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The heck was “Riche Bro”?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Riche Bro is the nickname that the school’s site gave you. It was chosen by your fan group…” Kang Peng muttered by his side.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Fan group!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen could only reveal an expression of helplessness. At the same time, he smiled towards Xiao Keke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hello, I’m Ye Zichen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, I’m called Xia Keke, I’m Su Yan’s best friend.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke reached out her pure white hands. Ye Zichen merely touched her hand for a brief moment before releasing it under the jealous gazes of his roommates. Then he greeted Su Yan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Morning.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You too.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan smiled lightly, but there was still a hint of embarrassment revealed on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke saw Su Yan’s reaction, then when she looked towards Ye Zichen, the desire for gossip in her eyes became that much more intense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The burning flames seemed set to burn Ye Zichen to dust.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Riche Bro, you guys should be going to the food court, right? What a coincidence, Susu and I are going too, how about we go together?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke smiled craftily. Ye Zichen didn’t want to accept at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The rumors about him and Su Yan was already going all around school, who knows what sort of rumors would arise from them eating breakfast together!</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the pack of wolves around him didn’t agree with his thoughts!</span></p>
 <p><span style>School beauty Xia Keke and school beauty Su Yan!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was an incomparable honor to eat with the two goddesses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ol’ Five, agree!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi, if you don’t, then it’s going to be the end of our brotherly bond of so many years.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fifth bro, I won’t threaten you, since, if you don’t agree, then don’t blame me if your League account drops to bronze.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Damn, isn’t this a f*cking threat!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, then let’s all go eat together.”</span></p>
