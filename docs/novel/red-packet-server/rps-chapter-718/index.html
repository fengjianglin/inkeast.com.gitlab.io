 <p><span style>Chapter 718 – Making a Scene</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen seemed unusually tiny in front of the huge black dragon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen felt more and more solemn as he looked forward.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This is an impossible task!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Although it looks like the dragon has already made a huge compromise by making me that offer, my strength cannot ever move a being like that dragon!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon smiled. He could already imagine Ye Zichen becoming the dragon’s food.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young man, stop wasting time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dragon huffed out another puff of hair from its nostrils.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Raging winds swept the pebbles in the valley up into the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen gritted his fists tightly and stepped forward.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Not bad, </span></i><span style>The dragon, who was lying on the ground, raised his eyebrows with a silent nod.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He didn’t give up the final sliver of hope, he did not fall to his desperation and beg…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The dragon was very satisfied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Lorie was naïve, she was no fool.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She understood very well that the situation was not good. She was also very nervous when Ye Zichen stepped forward determinedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Black Dragon…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sneered.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Trying to be a hero? He might as well just surrender.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, what they didn’t expect was…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old senior, you can’t screw me over like this. My relationship with the dragons run far and deep. The Old Dragon God of the dragons is half a master to me. They say a master for a day, father for a life, so half a dad for me. I can tell that you’re the Old Dragon God’s brother, so I’m a nephew for you!” Ye Zichen, who had a look of determination and resolution on his face, suddenly fell down by the dragon’s front leg.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He hugged the powerful leg and wailed in tears, “Old senior, I’m on super duper good terms with the dragons. The entire dragon race said I would be a very very very important person to them when I returned the Dragon God Ring! There’s a golden dragon girl of your clan that’s a really good friend of mine. If you eat me here, then the entire dragon race will be sad.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What. The. Hell.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Those words popped up in the heads of the other three people together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lorie, who was just worried about him, turned around. She did not want to see such an embarrassing moment.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This is too shameful!</span></i><a href="http://volarenovels.com/red-packet-server/rps-chapter-719/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>That was the same for the dragon who was originally looking down at Ye Zichen with a praising look…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Alright, let’s just say I didn’t have any opinions just now.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Old senior,” Ye Zichen cried as he swept his snot and tears onto the dragon’s leg.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dragon frowned and swung Ye Zichen to the side in his disappointment, “This old dragon already gave you a chance. As long as you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As long as I knock you back, you will leave, right?” Ye Zichen sobbed. When he saw the dragon nod, he immediately shook his head on the ground and made a scene. “No, this isn’t fair at all! Let’s be honest, just what strength are you? Then consider what strength I have? Let’s ignore all that. Let’s just think about your weight… Think about how many tons you are… No matter what I do, I won’t be able to move you!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He is making a scene now!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lorie was speechless. </span><i><span style>No, I don’t know him. This is </span></i><b><i>way</i></b><i><span style> too embarrassing.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Even if he wants to live, he can’t throw his face and dignity aside…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, Ye Zichen definitely would object against that. </span><i><span style>Just how much is face worth?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Your face or your life?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The dragon hesitated for a moment. Then, he leaned forward and rested his head in front of Ye Zichen and stared at the latter with his basketball-sized eyes, “What you are doing does not work on this dragon. If you don’t care about that chance, then this old dragon will just eat you now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Black Dragon, who was standing at a distance, felt more urgent!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior, you…” Black Dragon said urgently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you are in a hurry, then leave,” said the dragon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon couldn’t help but retort in his mind. </span><i><span style>I want to leave!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I’m worried about the ley line now, but I have to watch this dragon make true his promise with my own eyes.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>God knows if this dragon will just let them go after I leave. Then, Ye Zichen will still annoy me and I would have lost my trump card!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, after a harsh hesitation, he decided to stay and witness everything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, then I’ll stay.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then stop bullshitting,” the dragon replied, then turned back towards Ye Zichen. “Little fellow, it’s the same for you. This old dragon lacks patience. If you dare to make any more of a scene, then don’t blame me for not considering my connection with that old guy.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I guess I won’t have any more chance.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen twitched his mouth, stood up and patted the dirt on his body. He couldn’t help but roll his eyes at the dragon, “Look at how stingy you are, no wonder you didn’t become the dragon god back then.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why you…” the dragon raised his front claw.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen didn’t even look at him and instead rotated his arms and mustered up his spiritual energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh,” the dragon was furious after Ye Zichen’s mockery as well and all his desire to go easy on Ye Zichen was gone from his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen definitely would slap himself if he knew what the dragon thought. </span><i><span style>Retard, what the heck did you mouth off for!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Comrade Dragon, don’t blame me for not giving you a chance. I wasn’t willing to punch because I was worried that I would hurt you. You are basically a living fossil to stay alive from the primordial times until now. I wanted to keep you as a complete cultural artifact, but you refused to listen. If I cripple you… Don’t fault me,” Ye Zichen gripped his fists tightly in disdain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The old dragon chuckled, “Come, don’t say that I’m being too hard on you. I’ll give you three chances.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then here I come,” Ye Zichen’s expression straightened as spiritual energy gathered on his fist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Look, an airplane!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who was about to punch, suddenly pointed towards the sky with his other hand. Although the old dragon didn’t’ know what an airplane was, he still couldn’t help but turn back and look.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Heh.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing the old dragon let down his guard, Ye Zichen took that chance to punch the dragon on the chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A huge commotion sounded out in the valley, yet, the dragon did not even budge. Instead, Ye Zichen held his hand and jumped up in pain.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the hell.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>The skin is way too hard!</span></i><a href="http://volarenovels.com/red-packet-server/rps-chapter-719/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the dragon also turned around. He naturally understood that Ye Zichen tricked him, but he was not mad. It was normal to use any kind of little tricks one had at his disposal in these sort of impossible circumstances.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Two more chances,” said the dragon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen swung his pained arm, then took a step back.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Trying to move this old dragon is definitely impossible!</span></i><a href="http://volarenovels.com/red-packet-server/rps-chapter-719/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Xuan-Yuan!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xuan-Yuan Xiang appeared in front of Ye Zichen. Since they have been together for a long time, they didn’t really have to talk with each other anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xuan-Yuan Xiang already knew what Ye Zichen wanted to do from his glance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Double-up on the power!</span><a href="http://volarenovels.com/red-packet-server/rps-chapter-719/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Although the chances of success were slim, he still had to make use of the opportunity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Move!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen charged forward with his fist. Yet, the dragon maintained an indifferent expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Ye Zichen’s fist was about to reach the dragon…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How’s this possible!”</span><a href="http://volarenovels.com/red-packet-server/rps-chapter-719/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a></p>
