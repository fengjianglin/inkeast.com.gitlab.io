 <p><span style>Chapter 192 – Dream!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Coke paired with learning the Immortal Heart of Pure Yang.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen refused to believe that it wasn’t enough to turn the monkeys to his side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen gave them a night to consider his offer before running to the bedroom and opening the Treasure Chest on his phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The six Fragments of Soul Pearl Yiyuan were still peacefully resting within.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Withdraw.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Six fragments radiating with different colored lights appeared in Ye Zichen’s hand. The little ghost girl, Liu Qing, also floated out with a blink and looked at it curiously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are those!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s a treasure to revive you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen rubbed his hands…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The system has detected that it is possible to fuse the Fragments of Soul Pearl Yiyuan. Would you like to fuse them?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A dazzling light lit up in the room, illuminating the dark room until it was like the morning…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The three juggernauts of the three realms, the Jade Emperor, the Great Sacred Emperor Equaling Heavens and Fuxi opened their eyes at the exact same time…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Soul Pearl Yiyuan has appeared once more.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was nearly blinded by the sudden ray of light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a long time, the light in the room finally dimmed. Only then did Ye Zichen look up and see a green bead, that was levitating near the middle of his eyebrows, around the size of the glass balls that he would play with as he was younger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Such a normal bead.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It looked quite good when it was still in fragments, but after they fused together, this bead became single-colored and did not look good at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This… is Soul Pearl Yiyuan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen lifted his hand blankly. For some reason, Ye Zichen felt that this bead gave him a very familiar feeling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as if it was originally his treasure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This sort of divine artifact always have a spirit. For magical items that were of the same leve as the Soul Pearl Yiyuan, they would have chosen their owner from the moment they were created. Even if they were shattered then put together once again, they would still retain their past memories.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It would definitely not follow someone else easily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it didn’t run after it was put together once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Instead, it continued to move intimately in front of Ye Zichen…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you know me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen also felt the intimacy Soul Pearl Yiyuan felt towards him. After the bead heard his words, it instantly moved up and down a few times in a human fashion, as if it was nodding.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just what is going on?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>This bead actually said that it knows me.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Soul Pearl Yiyuan suddenly flew to the door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Creak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The door suddenly opened, and Third Fatty Jin fell in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fatty!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bo-Boss…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Fatty Jin smiled coyly. Just now, he had felt an intense fluctuation of Celestial Spiritual Energy, that was why he came over in an attempt to get some sort of information.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Soul Pearl Yiyuan, which was floating in midair, crashed into the fatty’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fatty of nearly a hundred kilograms directly flew out and slammed on the wall of the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yiyuan!” Ye Zichen shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing Ye Zichen’s words, Soul Pearl Yiyuan circled the fatty’s body a few more times, then returned to Ye Zichen’s side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gulp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fatty, who was lying on the floor, gulped.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Soul Pearl Yiyuan.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>This is a f*cking treasure that he saw in the textbooks while he was studying under Great Emperor Qingming.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>This is the Yellow Emperor’s personal magical item, and it was impossible for it to accept a second master.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>The fact that it was so intimate towards Ye Zichen meant one thing…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>He…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>All off a sudden, the fatty started to shake intensely like he was affected by malaria, while his face became stark white…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Yellow Emperor!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>One of the eight great sovereigns of the Three Realm’s Immortal Region.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>A thousand years ago, he was the pioneer who chose to reincarnate for the Immortal Region in order to reach the level of an Immortal King.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, he finally understood…</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was why his master told him to follow Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Master most likely knew about his original identity.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fatty kneeled on the floor with both his legs and kowtowed towards Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Ye, from now on, you are the only boss of I, Third Fatty Jin, from now on!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Third Fatty Jin walked out of the room with pursed lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment the door closed, the fatty’s stark white face instantly turned bright red…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Yellow Emperor!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>My boss is actually the reincarnation of the Yellow Emperor!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What the hell. That was so random.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Fatty Jin’s actions caused Ye Zichen to return to his senses from the familiar feeling that Soul Pearl Yiyuan gave him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He used his hand to pick up Soul Pearl Yiyuan, while the bead jumped around in his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are quite human like, but what can you do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soul Pearl Yiyuan instantly spun around his palm a few times…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was speechless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t understand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Never mind, you don’t know how to speak, so communicating with you is pretty troublesome. How about this, look around to see where you can hide.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soul Pearl Yiyuan instantly jumped up from the palm of his hand and went in through the center of his brows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen…” Liu Qing exclaimed. She literally saw the bead go through the center of Ye Zichen’s brows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fragments of memories begun to surface in Ye Zichen’s mind…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Battlefield!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blood!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monsters!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A man, who wore a golden armor and stood in front of him, while yelling “Big Bro, retreat” at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That woman, who was so beautiful that others couldn’t look straight at her, with nine white tails that were flowing behind her and tears on flowing from her eyes that said to him with a smile “this wife will stay with husband” …</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, the scene changed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man blocking in front of him vanished, and the sobbing woman also disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What replaced it were endless beast soldiers…</span></p>
 <p><span style>A huge banner danced in the air with the wind.</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>The words “Nine Li”<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>!</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>As for him!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He stood alone on a pile of corpses. He held a blunt sword in his hand, while blood flowed from his entire body…</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was like he was laughing!</span></p>
 <p><span style>And crying!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen… Ye Zichen… Ye Zichen…” Sharp screams sounded out by his ear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen awoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen unknowingly opened his eyes. It was still that lonely night, while Liu Qing had a worried expression in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I… What happened…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at his hands in confusion, the hands that were stained with blood…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The woman with nine tails, and the man in the armor…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Who are they!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen!” Liu Qing shook his arm intensely, causing him to return to his senses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows in annoyance, “Stop shouting, I’m here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Seriously, you always make me worried…” A hint of a crying tone could be heard from Liu Qing’s voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen lifted his hand to rub her head, “What happened to me just now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who knows what happened?” Liu Qing bit her lips angrily. “That bead randomly flew into your head, then after that, you started crying and laughing. I don’t know what happened to you either.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It might be the dream he had just now…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>No!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen suddenly opened his eyes wide as he looked at the pouting Liu Qing in shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you say just now? Soul Pearl Yiyuan went into my head?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, it went into your head.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was instantly stunned. He grabbed his phone and dialed Huang Shengmei’s number.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Prepare a skull opening surgery for me!” </span></p>
