 <p><span style>Chapter 81 – Hao Wen’s Threat</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, what you said to Bai Dahai just now wasn’t actually serious, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei looked at the front passenger seat while she drove. Ye Zichen slightly raised the corner of his mouth, rolled down the window of the car and lit a cigarette for himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t think this fatty came to ask for mercy, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did he not?” Xiao Yumei was shocked for a moment, she felt like everything the fatty said made sense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since they took all of the jade-giving ores in the ore circle, her jewelry chain could develop very quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Oppositely, those who were once competitors would fall into a trough.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As a leader in the industry, it is very normal for Fatty Bai to ask for ores when he couldn’t endure the pressure from the terrible business.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This fatty, ha, he’s not as simple as you think,” Ye Zichen squinted his eyes and smiled as he threw the cigarette butt outside the window.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, outside Xiao Yumei’s jewelry store.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty Bai sat in the car, but did not start it. Instead, he dialed a number.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hao-ge, Ye Zichen told me to give him fifty-one percent of the jewelry shop’s shares, do I agree?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fifty-one percent?” the person on the other side of the call blanked out for a moment, then laughed coldly. “Give it to him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But…” Fatty Bai was a bit reluctant. This was a business that he used time and effort to build up, giving it so easily to others…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No but’s, would Young Master Di treat you badly? Think about your daughter!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dark words on the other side of the call caused Fatty Bai to open his eyes wide, then finally submitted reluctantly, “I understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tiantian was dressed like a little princess and ran around the room like a joyous deer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sat on the living room sofa and reached out towards Tiantian. Seeing that, she immediately leapt into his gaze, “Daddy, why didn’t you bring Tiantian a present?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was speechless, only then did he remember that the Barbie he bought for Tiantian was still at home.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tiantian, how about daddy making it up to you next time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay. I want a huge Transformer,” Tiantian nodded with a smile, while &nbsp;Ye Zichen raised his eyebrow and smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t think that Tiantian would actually like the stuff that boys like.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, Tiantian, come and eat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They held Tiantian’s birthday at home, and since there weren’t many people at home, when the three of them sat together at the table, a sort of warmth had begun to spread out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tiantian sat closely beside Ye Zichen. Xiao Yumei could tell that she really liked this daddy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tiantian then started to run around the room once again after eating her birthday cake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen and Xiao Yumei sat on the living room sofa. As Xiao Yumei looked at Tiantian’s lively look, a smile couldn’t help but surface on her face, “Tiantian is much better than before, previously, she would never be so crazy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will see Tiantian more in the future,” Ye Zichen raised his hand and caressed Xiao Yumei’s hair, before wrapping his arm around her waist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei leaned her head lightly against Ye Zichen’s shoulders and closed her eyes in order to enjoy the feelings of safety her man brought her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The doorbell of the mansion rang, causing Xiao Yumei to raise her eyebrows in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She didn’t have any friends around her. Logically speaking, no one would press their doorbell at this moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She stood up from the sofa in confusion. When Xiao Yumei returned back into the mansion, a square box was in her hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is this?” Ye Zichen asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei shook her head, “I don’t know, it was left in at the mansion entrance.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen took the box over. It was extremely light, and he couldn’t hear any sounds even when he shook it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen untied the ribbon on the box with a frown and opened it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A birthday card fell out from within.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Happy birthday, Tiantian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Signed: Hao Wen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those were simple celebratory words, but what worried people was the image of a blood-dripping dagger behind the card.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hao Wen,” Xiao Yumei’s face turned stark white. Ye Zichen also looked at the card in his hand with a frown, and did not say anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, what did Hao Wen want to do by sending the card here? What does that dagger mean? Does he want to do something to Tiantian?” Xiao Yumei’s tone was full of nervousness. Although Tiantian was adopted, she had been beside her for so long, she couldn’t afford to see anything happen to Tiantian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry, perhaps he just wanted to wish Tiantian happy birthday,” Ye Zichen reached out his hand to caress Xiao Yumei’s hair and comforted her softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How about this, let Tiantian stay at my place. My place is definitely safe. No matter how capable Hao Wen is, he won’t be able to touch even a hair on Tiantian.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, I…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I understand,” Ye Zichen reached out his hand to pull Xiao Yumei into his arms, then patted her shoulders, while his eyes gradually emitted a cold light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Hao Wen was smart, then he better not have any bad thoughts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Otherwise, Ye Zichen would screw up even the people behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When night arrived, Tiantian, who had messed around for the entire day, returned to sleep in her room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stood up from the sofa with a smile and stretched, “Yumei, I’ll be going.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei suddenly wrapped her arms him from behind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The feeling that he suddenly felt behind from caused Ye Zichen to boil. He wrapped his arms behind her slender waist and kissed back…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Smooch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, go to my room.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen placed Xiao Yumei onto the bed, then essentially ripped off both of their clothes like a savage beast.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They soon became naked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei’s blush reached her neck as she looked at Ye Zichen, who was panting above her, with watery eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the soft call, she wrapped her arms around Ye Zichen’s neck and kissed him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In that instant, an explosion was triggered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen woke up the next morning, Xiao Yumei was no longer beside him. He couldn’t help but lick his lips when he thought back to the craziness the previous night…</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was truly a naturally sexy woman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damn pervert… Damn pervert!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing’s scream suddenly sounded out above Ye Zichen. He looked up and saw her glaring at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled wryly when he suddenly realized what happened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was too concentrated on rolling in the bedsheets with Xiao Yumei that he forgot that there was a virgin ghost girl, Lil’ Liu Qing, around him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the looks of her, she seemed to have watched the battle the entire night?</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was definitely a devastation to her sight and mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, sorry. But this isn’t completely my fault, when the feelings arise… What’s more, you could have stayed in the Dragon Eye, I didn’t force you to watch.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen said shamelessly. Hearing that, Liu Qing waved her fists and pounded him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen allowed her raindrop-like punches to hit his chest. However, his phone rang at that moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen placed the phone beside his ear and heard a deep voice sound out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, let’s meet.”</span></p>
