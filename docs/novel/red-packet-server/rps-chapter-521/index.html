 <p><span style>Chapter 521 – Pitiful Shi Qian</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Qian, who was standing at the window, was about to cry. He grabbed his huge cloth sack tightly while looking at the tall man standing in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His wry smile caused the man in front of him to be confused…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have we met before?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“?” This time, it was Shi Qian’s turn to be shocked. He looked at the man in front of him dumbly and raised his eyebrows. “Dude, you don’t recognize me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Should we know each other?” The man was also confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Qian’s crying face instantly revealed a joyous expression when he heard the man’s confused reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck, you scared laozi to death. Big bro, since we don’t know each other, can you let little bro have this window position? Little bro has to run away,” Shi Qian said in a hurry. The Human Immortal experts were chasing after him like mad dogs. He didn’t have much time to waste at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man subconsciously made way for Shi Qian, allowing Shi Qian to climb out of the window…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait a moment,” yet, the man stopped Shi Qian before he could even run far.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Qian’s expression drastically changed .He gulped, then turned back to see the man grab him, “Big bro, don’t we not know each other?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Qian inwardly sobbed. </span><i><span style>So this guy was just messing with me?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He was truly speechless. </span><i><span style>I’ve only acted twice, and was stopped by this guy both times. Should I say that it is fate? Or am I just unlucky…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I really can’t recall who you are, but my bro has told me to capture you,” the man shrugged helplessly, then climbed in through the window. At that moment, Ye Zichen had already ran over to the seventh floor’s auction stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man who captured Shi Qian waved towards Ye Zichen and walked over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man dropped Shi Qian onto the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Mo took about three seconds to react to what was going on before knitting her eyebrows and shouting out, “Suppress him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The surrounding Human Immortal experts all rushed over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Zuo Mo wanted to thank the man, she saw the man walk in front of Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yang Jian, you truly came on time,” Ye Zichen smiled and patted his shoulders, then raised his eyebrows. “Why isn’t Old Pig with you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Pig…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m here, I’m here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The wall of the seventh floor of the auction house shattered, and a muscular man with an oily face, and dressed in a faint purple robe, walked in. He looked very much like a person who often took hyaluronic acid injections.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who!? An associate!?” the auction house people put up their guards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but facepalm and smile wryly when he saw this. </span><i><span style>Does Zhu Ganglie</span></i><span style><span><a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></span></span><i><span style> not know how to walk in through the door?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Then he glanced towards the various Treasure Tower people and waved towards Zuo Mo, “Tell your people that that person is my friend, so there’s no need for them to be so nervous.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright,” Zuo Mo’s eyes shone with an interested light as she scanned Ye Zichen, Yang Jie and Zhu Ganglie in turn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then she turned around to comfort her Treasure Tower people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Ye Zichen also walked over, “Don’t you know how to walk through the door?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re Sky Sovereign? That shitty brat Yang Jian is a true piece of work. He left while I was buying stuff to eat. Since I don’t have the money for over here, I had to give the shopkeeper a spiritual pearl. Ahh, I, Old Pig, lost so much,” Zhu Ganglie said as he twitched his mouth towards Yang Jian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You only know how to eat. Are you a pig!?” Yang Jian scolded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, you really are right. I am a pig,” Zhu Ganglie glared and snorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t be more speechless when he heard the response. </span><i><span style>But I suppose only Zhu Ganglie is capable of calling himself a pig with such confidence.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>There’s nothing wrong with what he said at all. He is a pig after all.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Say, can you guys care about me a little. It feels rather terrible to lie on the floor,” Shi Qian, who was left off to the side, couldn’t help but speak up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Treasure Tower guest chamberlain suppressing him smacked his head, “Stay put.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Seriously, laozi is the Divine Thief Shi Qian. Even if you guys did capture me, you should let laozi retain a bit more dignity, right? Otherwise, just how is laozi supposed to raise my head in front of people when I return?” Shi Qian complained as he was on the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen squatted down and smiled, “You still want to return?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who’re you?” Shi Qian looked up and snorted. “I’m telling you. Just keep holding me like this if you dare. Otherwise, even if you lock me up, laozi can still run out. If I didn’t bump into that guy, do you think you guys could have captured me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems like you are very confident in your escaping skills?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not very confident. It’s extremely confident,” Shi Qian snorted, then struggled. “Hurry up and let laozi stand up. This floor is so damn cold. Can you guys afford to make me catch a cold?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let him stand up,” Ye Zichen smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The guest chamberlains suppressing him all looked towards Zuo Mo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do as he said. From now on, his words are equivalent to my words,” Zuo Mo replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The guest chamberlains quickly let Shi Qian go.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Qian, who managed to get free, patted away the dust on his body and snorted, “That’s more like it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Shi Qian was acting cockily, someone smacked the back of his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Which grandson… Big Bro, how did this little one piss you off now?” Shi Qian instantly gave up when he saw that it was actually Yang Jian who smacked him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Laozi remembers who you are now. You’re that brat I caught last time, right? I’m telling you, be more polite when you speak with my bro, otherwise, laozi will beat you up,” Yang Jian raised his hands to scare Shi Qian as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Qian instantly shrank his neck and twitched his mouth bitterly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but chuckle, “Say, your luck is seriously terrible. You actually bumped into me both times when you came to rob this place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmph…” Shi Qian snorted. However, the moment he saw Yang Jian frown, he instantly changed his expression. “Yes, yes, yes, I’m unlucky! Say it, just what do you want me to do? Do you want me to steal for you or what? Didn’t I just rob you a few times, it’s not like I succeeded, so why get so worked up?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen continued to smile when he saw how Shi Qian acted.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This Divine Thief is rather funny!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t want you to help me steal anything, I just want to ask you a question. If you answer truthfully, then I can let you go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You sure?” Shi Qian’s eyes brightened. Then he glanced at the people around the room, who were glaring at him. “Are your words of any use?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes,” Zuo Mo replied. “If he says to let you go, nobody will stop you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Girlie, and just who are you supposed to be!?” Shi Qian rolled his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The guest chamberlains of the Treasure Tower instantly roared with a scowl, “This is the young lady of our Treasure Tower. Be more courteous when you are in front of her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you getting mean for? Do you think you’re my big bro?” Shi Qian rolled his eyes, then shrugged towards Ye Zichen. “Ask away. I’ll answer whatever you ask!”</span></p>
