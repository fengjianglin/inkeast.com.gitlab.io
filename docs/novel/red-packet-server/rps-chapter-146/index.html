 <p><span style>Chapter 146 – False Spiritual Body</span></p>
 <p><span style>The wine within the glass was a terrifying blood red. When Di Tian drank it all in a gulp, wine flowed down the corner of his mouth to his neck, causing people to feel an unusual chill in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Di Tian snapped the wine glass at the stem, then walked in front of Su Yan’s face and softly slid the foot of the glass across her cheek, “Afraid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan’s body trembled slightly. No matter what, she couldn’t be afraid. As long as Di Tian used even just a tiny a bit of strength, her face would be scarred.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m very satisfied with your current appearance. Terror, reluctance, resentment… I like it a lot.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just wait for death. Ye Zichen definitely wouldn’t let you off after he arrives,” Xia Keke glared at him and shouted in anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Di Tian frowned, while a hint of dissatisfaction flashed across his eyes, “Very strong, don’t you believe that…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zzz…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The foot of the glass slid across Xia Keke’s face, leaving a faint line of blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aiya, so sorry, I didn’t control my strength. Hurry up and get her a bandaid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Riche Bro won’t let you off,” Xia Keke shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Su Yan also scolded in anger, “Di Tian, what you’re doing is illegal. My dad nor my grandpa would let you off.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Di Tian revealed a playful smile as he snorted, “Do you think I think much of the Su family? You have been captured by me for so long, do you see your father or grandpa anywhere?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Di Tian returned to the sofa with a snicker.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked up at the living room clock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Get ready, it’s nearly time. Slice their faces one for every minute that passes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A dagger shining with a cold light suddenly appeared in the hands the two girls controlling Su Yan and Xia Keke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I wonder if you can make it,” Di Tian squinted his eyes and smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Buzz…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The engine sounded out like thunder as Ye Zichen sped towards the address Di Tian sent him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A palace-like mansion entered his sights, and there were ten off black-shirted hulks patrolling outside of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who is it, get out of the car.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>These hulks immediately surrounded Ye Zichen’s car, the moment it appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Di Tian told me to come find him. Let me in.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master didn’t say that he was going to see any guests. Please leave,” said the man in a black vest, as he made a please gesture.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately understood when he saw their actions.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Di Tian set this all up.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Crack,</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clenched his fists tight and stared at the black door behind the twelve hulks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ten minutes remained.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Since you want to play, then let’s play.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen returned to the car and fastened his seatbelt, then smiled as he stared straight at the black door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stepped down the the pedal, causing the expensive Porsche 918 to speed towards the twelve hulks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The black shirted hulks all instinctively rolled to the side, while Ye Zichen’s car crashed onto the metal gate without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A huge noise sounded out at the gate. At the same time, a screen appeared on the tea table in front of Di Tian, who was sitting in the living room, starting from an unknown time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He raised his eyebrows when he saw Ye Zichen, who continuously crashed the car against the gate, and couldn’t help but smile, “He’s got a temper.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The bumper on the front of the car had already been destroyed, but a huge dent also appeared on the black metal gate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gradually, the front of the car began to smoke, but Ye Zichen relentlessly crashed the &nbsp;car against the gate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll let you have a look…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Di Tian turned the screen around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Su Yan and Xia Keke saw this, both of them screamed, “Jump out of the car, jump out of the car!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, their screams did not reach Ye Zichen’s ears.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He only had one thought in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Crash it open.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The twelve hulks were completely shocked. Di Tian had told them to stay there to delay Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They didn’t think that Ye Zichen would use such an extreme method.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They stood dumbly on the side and watched Ye Zichen crash his car over and over again onto the metal gate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the metal gate fell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, the car was completely unrecognizable due to Ye Zichen’s actions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>More and more smoke came from the front of the car, making it seem to get closer and closer to the time of explosion. Ye Zichen swiftly pulled Hao Wen from the car and jumped out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The car exploded like a fiery lotus, while Ye Zichen, who had yet to reach a safe location, was swallowed by the lotus of flames.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within the mansion, Su Yan and Xia Keke screamed out loud. More importantly, Xia Keke’s eyes gradually turned gold, while her hair also started to turn from black to gold…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Di Tian, you pissed me off.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, a dark and cold voice sounded out from the screen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who’s hair was completely burnt away and clothes were burnt full of holes, slowly walked out of the fiery lotus dragging Hao Wen, whose status was unknown, behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ve really pissed me off.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s muttering continuously sounded out form the screen. When Su Yan and Xia Keke saw this, they begun to weep tears of joy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Xia Keke’s golden eyes and hair started to revert to their normal color as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Interesting, it really is getting more and more interesting,” Di Tian laughed maniacally and looked at the time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Five minutes remaining.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Contact Team B to stop him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen started to walk forward step by step. The moment the car exploded, Ye Zichen had activated Unbreakable Body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even so, his body still suffered tremendous amounts of damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only reason he could stand and continue to walk towards the mansion was due to his determination.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had to hurry over in the set time and save Su Yan as well as Xia Keke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Four short-haired women in skin tight suits blocked the way in front of the mansion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked up and scanned his gaze across them, then snorted with his croaky voice, “You’re going to stop me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>No reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the four girls instantly dashed towards Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen chucked Hao Wen to the ground, then the light in his eyes faded, while being replaced with an intolerable anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*CK OFF!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen directly punched one of the women. The woman, who endured Ye Zichen’s raging strike, instantly flew out like a loose kite, before coughing up blood and falling onto the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other three looked at each other, and saw the wariness in each others’ eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, due to Di Tian, they couldn’t help but force themselves forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Another woman flew out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop forcing me. I don’t want to hit women, but if you are going to come over. Then, die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stomped the ground forcefully with his right foot, causing a huge crack in the granite ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pupils of Di Tian, who was in the room, contracted.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>False Spiritual Body.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He smiled slightly and looked up at the time once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One minute.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Di Tian lifted the walkie talkie and said one phrase, which rang out in the Bluetooth ear pieces of the four girls.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop him for one minute, regardless of the cost.”</span></p>
