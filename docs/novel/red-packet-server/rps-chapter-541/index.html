 <p><span style>Chapter 541 – Kidnapped</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pulled open the curtains, saw that the sky had already turned dark, while several burning torches not so far in front of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Beasts were terrified of fire in the dark night, so it was clear that the earth dragon’s unease was caused by the flames coming closer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the people holding the torches moved closer, Ye Zichen and Zuo Mo could hear the chattering of the horse hooves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Help!” An anxious voice was heard once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Mo asked the driver with a frown, “What happened?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Lady, someone seems to have been met with bandits in front of us. That person is calling for help!” said the driver. “Should we go around them or…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Help me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A man covered with dirt appeared in front of the carriage before Zuo Mo could even reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am the junior city lord of Pond City. Please send me back to Pond City, I will definitely thank you greatly for this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let him come up,” Zuo Mo only felt a bit of pity when she saw the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, the man hurriedly jumped into the carriage excitedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, what was strange was that the moment the man climbed on, the pursuers actually went around them a few times, then left. They showed no intention of fighting for the person at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you so much. I really don’t know what I would have done if it wasn’t for you guys,” the man smiled thankfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Mo nodded, “We should help each other when we’re out. We’re going over to Pond City right now, so we can take you over along the way. But this is quite far from Pond City, how did you appear here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s a long story. I was kidnapped by those bandits,” the man sighed. “They wanted to use me to ask my father for ransom, but I managed to run away while they were off guard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then you’re pretty lucky,” Ye Zichen smiled meaningfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The amount of ransom that the city lord’s son could get was no small amount. Since the bandits dared to kidnap the city lord’s son, they were definitely people who lived with their lives on the line.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The fact that they actually stopped chasing when their target climbed onto the carriage…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>This is kind of strange!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Perhaps,” the man shrugged, but the moment he shrugged, Ye Zichen grabbed his arm. “Brother…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re not the city lord’s son,” Ye Zichen grabbed his wrist tightly with a frown. “Who exactly are you? Why are you trying to get close to us!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother, what do you mean by that?” The man revealed a frantic look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen snorted, “Your hands are very coarse. They are clearly hands of people who often work. Do you need to farm as the city lord’s son?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is from practicing martial arts…”</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>“Heh, martial arts? If it was from martial arts, then the callus on your hands wouldn’t be like this. What’s more, your purlicue<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> is weak. You’re at most a person who is physically strong. Say it, who exactly are you!?” Ye Zichen pinned the man onto the carriage.</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the man suddenly laughed, “I can’t believe you even noticed that, but what a shame, it’s still too late.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Mo suddenly fell down in the carriage, while Ye Zichen felt a bit light-headed as well. All of a sudden, he was seeing double when he looked at the man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sleep. This young lord has never seen any one be able to resist this Dreamslumber Powder!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen could no longer fight the sleepiness that was about to overcome him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Lady!” The driver immediately noticed something amiss within the carriage, however, the man merely scattered a bit of powder towards the driver, causing him to slowly lose consciousness as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, an earth dragon carriage, it seems like I caught a big fish again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen…” A soft murmur sounded out by Ye Zichen’s ear, causing him to open his eyes blurrily. When he did, he saw that they were no longer in the carriage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re awake? It seems like we were tricked,” Zuo Mo, who saw beside him, said dejectedly. Even an idiot could tell in this sort of situation that the man who claimed to be the Pond City’s city lord’s son was lying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s all my fault. If only I hadn’t allowed him onto the carriage.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, both of their hands and feet were tied together. Ye Zichen tried to struggle out of it with a frown…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop trying, it’s useless,” at that moment, a man’s voice could be heard near him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen turned around, and saw that another man was also tied up like them not far away. It was obvious from the way the man dressed that he was no ordinary person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“These ropes are replicas of the Immortal Tying Rope. Although they don’t even contain a ten-thousandth of the strength of the actual celestial artifact, they are still have some special effects. The more you struggle, the tighter the rope will be.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as the man had said, Ye Zichen tried to struggle out of the ropes, only to feel the restraint become even tighter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, he could only give up, “Who are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am Qiu Yuan, the son of Pond City’s city lord. The people who captured me are some bandits. They probably kidnapped me to get money from my father,” the man said with a sigh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen and Zuo Mo were both shocked for a moment. Then Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows, “You are the son of Pond City’s city lord?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? I don’t look like it?” Qiu Yuan raised his eyebrows. “What does your family do? These bandits always capture big fish. Since you guys are here, you are clearly no normal person. Getting captured here together is fate. We might as well get to know each other!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are pretty optimistic,” Ye Zichen smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s not optimism. It’s impossible for us to run with this Immortal-Binding Rope. Of course, you guys have no need to worry, these bandits merely want money. They won’t do anything to us as long as the ransom is paid. So, it could be said that we’re safe,” Qiu Yuan said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So they do have some principles,” Zuo Mo twitched her mouth. It was obvious that she was in a rather poor mood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, Qiu Yuan, when’s your father going to send us the money?” At that moment, the man that had lied to Ye Zichen and co. by telling that he was the song of the city lord entered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Ma, you’ve already captured me four times this month. Even if my dad’s the city lord, he wouldn’t be able to afford it for much longer!” Qiu Yuan said helplessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man smiled apologetically, “Sorry brother. Business hasn’t been good recently. You’re the only person who’s rather easy to capture, so hurry up and contact your father to pay up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, he looked over to Ye Zichen and Zuo Mo. Seeing that both of them had woken up, he walked over with a chuckle, “You’re awake. Then, don’t stay idle. Tell us your identities, so I can contact your family. We don’t have a standard ransom, the prices are all decided by your own identity. We’ll definitely let you go after getting the money!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good job on that,” Ye Zichen smiled meaningfully, then raised his eyebrows. “But you are going to be disappointed. Neither of us are from large families. Do you know of Spiritual Breeze Village near Maple City? We’re from that village.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t try to lie to me. An earth dragon carriage cannot be ridden by commoners,” the driver smiled, then motioned towards Zuo Mo. “If you don’t want anything to happen to the beauty beside you, then pay up!”</span></p>

 <p></p>
 <p><i>In the next chapter of Red Packet Server...</i></p>
 <p>A young man cries for the help of Ye Zichen and Zuo Mo in the middle of a piece of desolated land. Why did he do that? Although it seems to be due to the bandit-like people chasing him from first glance, was that really the case?</p>
 <p>But, if the man is lying, then what could he possible have to gain from getting Ye Zichen and Zuo Mo's help?</p>
 <p>They may seem like a pair of rich people with their drivers, it is not like the others know of their identity, right?</p>
 <p>Perhaps, the young man is speaking the truth?</p>
 <p>Or was it another one of Ye Zichen's tribulations?</p>
