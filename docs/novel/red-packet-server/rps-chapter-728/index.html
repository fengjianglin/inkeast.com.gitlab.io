 <p><span style>Chapter 728 – The Innocent Nezha</span></p>
 <p><span style>The deities in the group did not think of themselves as people without lines that they were unwilling to cross. </span><i><span style>Trying to make us reveal where the boss is petty bribery?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hmmph.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Don’t joke around.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>We would never do that!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King Li was the first to speak up as an old subordinate of the Jade Emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, how could we know about the Jade Emperor’s whereabouts? Fellow deities, don’t you think so as well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King Li was removed from Red Packet Server.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let me ask you again. What have your bosses been doing? You will be rewarded for any reports.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the deities in the group gasped. </span><i><span style>Sky Sovereign isn’t letting us stay spoiled! He even kicked Heavenly King Li. Is there anything that he doesn’t dare to do!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Heavenly King Li was stunned as well. </span><i><span style>Wait… Didn’t we fight side by side half a month ago?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>He just kicked me!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Nezha!” Heavenly King Li shouted without thinking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon, Nezha hurried over on the Wind Fire Wheels with a soccer ball in his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nezha quickly lowered his head and muttered when he saw Li Jing’s dark look. “This child knows his wrongs.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Jing was completely and utterly confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had called Nezha over to ask his child to put in some words with the Sky Sovereign so he can return. </span><i><span style>What did he do wrong?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Wrongs?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm, this child really does know his wrongs. I gave the Luminous Pearl you got from the old dragon of the East Sea to Immortality Peach-jiejie. Sorry about that. But you told me since I was a kid that I should not ask people to get back what I already gave them. Just hit me if you’re angry, that is if you can beat me.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Huh?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Li Jing was confused for a long time. </span><i><span style>The Luminous Pearl I got from the old dragon of the East Sea?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Heavenly King shot up and cursed, “You damn bastard! You actually gave the Luminous Pearl away? That was my anniversary present for your mother!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on? I heard someone calling from me from miles away,” Heavenly King Li’s wife walked with a plate of fruits and giggled. She was already used to her husband and her son arguing with each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Instead, she was far more interested in the present they were talking about.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What present?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s the one my father…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shut up!” Heavenly King Li glared at Nezha. Although he couldn’t beat Nezha now, he still possessed his authority as Nezha’s father.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nezha immediately lowered his head like an ostrich when he saw the glare.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Heavenly King Li’s wife did not understand, “You didn’t say what the present was yet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dear, I need to have a chat with Nezha, so we’ll be right back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Heavenly King Li floated up into the air and dragged Nezha away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You didn’t eat your fruits yet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll eat them later.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>They flew through the air for several minutes and met many deities who greeted them with smiles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Heavenly King Li would always return the greetings regardless of their position being the nice person that he is.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he finally dealt with all the deities, he glared at Nezha, “You little bastard, you’re actually stealing your father’s treasure to please girls!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nezha stuck his tongue out pitifully. He merely found the Luminous Pearl to look nice and Immortality Peach-jiejie might like it. That’s why he stole it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t know that it was a present for his mother.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright alright, I’ll help you ask for another one. If that old dragon refuses, then I’ll kill his dragons until he does.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Heavenly King Li’s expression immediately darkened when he heard the little dragon slaying master say that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just stop causing trouble for me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what about Mother’s gift?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have my ways,” Heavenly King Li clicked his tongue. “I have proper business with you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, okay.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahem… I.. Uhm… got kicked out of the group by Sky Sovereign.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won’t tell you why, but hurry up and ask Sky Sovereign to let me back in.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now, the orders were given in the group and socializing was done there as well. The Red Packet Server had already become an integral part of their lives. It was going to be very troublesome if he wasn’t able to return.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, wait a moment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s act turned the entire group silent. He could understand why though. No matter what, the were being paid by the Jade Emperor and the Great Sacred Emperor Equaling Heavens. It would be terrible for them to report on their bosses outright.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>But that doesn’t mean they can’t send me a private message! But nobody’s saying anything!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen took out his phone and saw a small red “1” on Nezha’s chat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, my father said that you kicked him from the group. Can you let him back in?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen naturally could not allow clear opposition to set a negative example for the other deities. He must prevent situations like that from ever happening again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign said no,” Nezha shrugged towards his father.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Beg him a bit more.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon, Nezha sent another message to Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My father told me to beg you a bit more. Please let him in. I accidentally let him know that I stole the wedding anniversary present my father was going to give to my mother. If you don’t let him back in, then he might beat me up in anger again. Sky Sovereign, you definitely don’t want me to get beaten up when I’m this cute, right? What’s more, Immortality Peach-jiejie is your little sister, then I’m your future brother-in-law!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign sent me a row of ellipses,” Nezha reported to his father.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Heavenly King Li felt a bit troubled. </span><i><span style>Isn’t he overreacting? I just said a single sentence, what’s there to get mad for?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>How about I tell him what he wants to know?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign sent me another message,” Nezha blurted out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did he say?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“See for yourself!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nezha put his phone in front of Heavenly King Li, who began to read…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tell Old Li that if he tells me information about the Jade Emperor, I’ll let him back into the group and let him be an admin. Oh, and of course I can help him handle the anniversary present.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, deal!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are…” Ye Zichen replied in a testing manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m Old Li,” Heavenly King Li replied with Nezha’s phone. “I can tell you information about the Jade Emperor. I hope that you will keep to your promise and let me back in the group and help me handle the anniversary present.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When did I not keep my promise?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pretty much always!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Heavenly King Li couldn’t help but think to himself. However, he did not dare to reply like that. He could only force a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign naturally keeps his word all the time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what are you waiting for? Tell me what he has been doing during the past two weeks. I will definitely satisfy you if you satisfy me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen replied quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, his phone rang again. He took a look at who it was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Qinguang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oops, I nearly forgot about him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smirked.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>There we go!</span></i></p>
 <p></p>

 <p><b>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</b>So... Anyone?</p>
 <p><strong>Heavenly King Li:&nbsp;</strong>Sky Sovereign, as mere officials, we cannot hope to know the location of the Jade Emperor. Fellow deities, am I right?</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Oh, is that so? Then bye bye.</p>
 <p>&lt;Heavenly King Li has been removed from the group.&gt;</p>
