 <p><span style>Chapter 64 – Treasure Shop</span></p>
 <p><span style>That old geezer, Taibai Jinxing, was definitely an old fox in the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had a complete grasp of Ye Zichen’s thoughts. Thus, Ye Zichen accepting it under the combination of his combination of threats and offers was all within his expectations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing: Since you’ve accepted, then we have an agreement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A red packet immediately followed after he sent the message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received Taibai Jinxing’s red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Celestial Number: 1365</span></p>
 <p><span style>Celestial Plate: Sky Sovereign Nameless (Cultivation Experience: 0, Level 1 Celestial Official)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Residence: 137 Willow Stone Alley, Thirty-Seventh Heaven</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing: This is your identity in the group from now on, Sky Sovereign Nameless. Let me tell you, the Thirty-Seventh Heaven is a place only great deities can stay. You have to use your identity well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing said it like it was something amazing. However, Ye Zichen merely twitched his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So what if Taibai Jinxing gave him a residence in the Ninety-Ninth Heaven to live with the Jade Emperor and the Queen Mother?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Can a mere mortal like him actually go there!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>In other words, it’s completely useless for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: You might as well give me some actual things instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing: One moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Another red packet appeared on the screen. Ye Zichen quickly opened it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received Taibai Jinxing’s red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cultivation Experience x3000</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ugh.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nearly coughed up blood.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the hell? Perhaps cultivation experience is actually useful for those deities?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But what does that have to do with him?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Can you give me something of actual use?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing: Don’t think that it’s not enough. A high cultivation experience allows you to raise your official rank in the Heavenly Court. That would only be beneficial towards you. What’s more, this cultivation experience has way too many uses for you. Go and figure it out yourself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: …</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing: Don’t be speechless, you will only beg me to give you cultivation experience in the future. Remember, get into the Underworld group as quick as possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Taibai Jinxing irresponsibly left. Ye Zichen could only feel helpless towards all that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He opened the Celestial Plate within his Treasure Chest with a sigh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Celestial Plate: Sky Sovereign Nameless (Cultivation Experience: 3000, Level 3 Celestial Official)</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the hell is the use of this!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen really didn’t want to retort about it, what use was it for him even if he was promoted to a Level 100 Celestial Official?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Immortality?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Never aging?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Or could he truly rise to become a deity and go to the Heavenly Court?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ignoring the fact that he can’t, even if he could, he wouldn’t want to go.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as he wanted to close WeChat, he suddenly noticed that a new function appeared beside the Treasure Chest.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Treasure Shop!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clicked open the Treasure Shop curiously, then bolted up from the chair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He understood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This cultivation experience was truly of too much use of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were ten-odd pages full of items in it. Behind each of them was the cultivation experience that was required in order to exchange for it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clicked on “Misc Items.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Third Prince Nezha’s love letter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Proof of the Ox Demon King’s adultery.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Literari Star’s school report.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most terrifyingly…</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was also the fairy Chang’e’s underwear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of these things that didn’t seem to be of any actual use required astronomical amounts to exchange for them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Items!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Heavenly Court dog food.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Heavenly Court plants.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Heavenly Court vegetables.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of them were items that were labeled as “Heavenly Court” items. In comparison, these required a lower amount to exchange for them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They ranged from several tens of cultivation experience to several hundred cultivation experience.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was something that he could accept with his current amount of cultivation experience.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he clicked open the secret scripture types!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Secret Scripture of the Fiery Eyes of Truth (Level 1). Required amount: 1,000,000 cultivation experience. (The Level 2 secret scripture can be purchased after its purchase)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Secret Scripture of the Body Freezing Technique (Level 1). Required amount: 1,000,000 cultivation experience. (The Level 2 secret scripture can be purchased after its purchase)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Secret Scripture of the Seventy-Two Transformations (Level 1).</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang’s special medical book (Book 1)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Secret Scripture of Literari Star’s Photographic Memory.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Such a sly old fox,” Ye Zichen couldn’t help but swear. He didn’t have to guess to know that the old guy was responsible for removing his Fiery Eyes of Truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then the old guy brought up a bunch of crappy secret scriptures here for him to exchange.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So smart.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen felt a bit of admiration for that geezer, Taibai Jinxing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your Fiery Eyes of Truth (Level 1) has 71 hours of trial time remaining.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The system sounded out once again. This time, the corner of Ye Zichen’s mouth raised.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>You want to take back my Fiery Eyes of Truth, right? Then I’ll use enough of it first.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Within three days, Ye Zichen took Xiao Yumei and swept across countless Ore Auctions. Since the amount he bought was far too much, he even received several hundred million of funds from Xiao Hai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen did not lose anything from the stones that he bought, despite buying in such large quantities.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From that point onwards, Ye Zichen got a new title in the circles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Stone God Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The trial period for your Fiery Eyes of Truth (Level 1) has ended. The secret scripture is retracted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen finally relaxed after getting this message. He didn’t waste any of the seventy something hours he had remaining for the Fiery Eyes of Truth. He turned towards Xiao Yumei, who was beside him…</span></p>
 <p><span style>To be honest, although Xiao Yumei was a beautiful woman, she was definitely a strong woman when working.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within the three days, she had continuously stayed by Ye Zichen’s side as they bought stones.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was nearly dead from exhaustion, yet she didn’t feel any fatigue at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, where are we going next?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nowhere, we have enough jade in our hands. Let’s leave some chances for other people,” Ye Zichen sighed unenergetically.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing his tired look, Xiao Yumei kissed him on his lips, “You’ve been troubled. Hurry up and rest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what about you?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrow. However, Xiao Yumei giggled excitedly, “I have to process all this jade as fast as possible. Our jewelry shop can definitely expand several times with these jade.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shook his head and smiled helplessly, “You’ve been tired out these few days too. Just rest properly before going. What’s more, you don’t need to watch over the jade processing in person.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei reached out her hands, hook it around Ye Zichen’s neck and smiled, “I’ll send you back to rest first. As for me, you don’t need to mind.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen could only sigh helplessly towards this and nod in agreement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei drove away hurriedly after sending Ye Zichen back to the entrance of the mansion’s compound.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rubbed his hurting temples. At that moment, his phone rang. Ye Zichen couldn’t help but smile wryly when he took a look at the caller ID. It seems like he isn’t going to be able to rest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within a family restaurant half an hour later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun had wanted to take Ye Zichen to a larger club, but Ye Zichen didn’t have any interest in playing in his current condition, so they just settled down in a normal restaurant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi, thank you so much for my grandpa.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun raised his beer glass. Ye Zichen raised his own and touched Su Yiyun’s beer glass with it and shrugged, “It was no big deal. How is Old Man Su recently?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t mention it, his body is indescribably good. Oh yeah, my grandpa said that he wants to treat you to a meal later, don’t refuse it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won’t, as for you…” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes in annoyance. “You were actually siblings with the goddess Su Yan, you hid it pretty well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hahaha…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun laughed loudly. Then, all of a sudden, he stopped and raised his eyebrow, “Ye-zi, do you feel that beauty over there looks rather familiar?”</span></p>
