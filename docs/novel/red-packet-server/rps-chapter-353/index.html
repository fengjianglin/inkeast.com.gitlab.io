 <p><span style>Chapter 353 – You’ve got the Wrong Person</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yang Jian, I’m going to kill you!” the demon king’s eye flashed with a red light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, the air was filled with a revolting smell. When Ye Zichen smelled the stench, he felt as if his spirits were starting to sag.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the people around him began to fall to the ground, he subconsciously activated the Fiery Eyes of Truth…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The souls of those people started to fly towards the demon king in the sky, and that even included the souls that had already been captured by the Underworld’s ghost servants!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not good,” Yang Jian frowned. His third eye was clearly able to see that the souls of the mortals below him were becoming the nourishment of the demon, and were replenishing his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The strength of the demon king opposite him gradually started to rise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian frowned. If the fight dragged on, then even he would have trouble against the demon king.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Petty tricks. Die!” Yang Jian thrust forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he did that, the demon king had already grown another hand to replace his lopped off one. He licked his lips slightly greedily, “The souls of mortals are truly great nourishment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he watched Yang Jian’s lance pierced the skies towards him, the demon king did not retreat and instead met it face on. His fist shimmered with a black light as he punched.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There!” the demon king roared. The moment the lance crashed against his fist, the sound of metal colliding sounded out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reflective force passed through the lance, causing Yang Jian’s purlicue to bleed, but he still maintained a tight grip on his war lance.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck, it got slightly tricky. </span></i><span style>Yang Jian cursed silently in his heart. </span><i><span style>If I let the demon king continue devouring souls like this, then I have no chance of victory.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Stop fretting. Think about how the monkey will do in this situation!</span></i><span style> Yang Jian thought to himself. However, the only thing he was able to think of was a single sentence…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ha, if it was Grandpa Sun, then just smash it down with my stick. Who cares about so much? Care about whether it can be beaten after hitting it!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Damn monkey, can’t you say something useful? </span></i><span style>Yang Jian cursed angrily in his heart. At the same time, Great Sage Sun, who was eating fruits in the Water Curtain Cave on Mt. Huaguo, couldn’t help but sneeze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He frowned, chucked the peach in his hand to the side, then made a few incantation gestures.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yang Jian… What kind of danger did this grandson get into? I can’t figure it out. Ahh, whatever, I can only pray that nothing happens to him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hahaha, the Heavenly Court’s war god Yang Jian is only so-so!” the demon king laughed unrestrainedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Yang Jian clenched his teeth, “The monkey’s right. Hit it first. How can laozi endure this grandson just bragging here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian gripped his lance tightly and rapidly thrust towards the demon king.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ding ding dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What made people feel like giving up was that the lance could not do any damage to the demon king’s body at all. It was as if the demon king’s body had a layer of impenetrable protective shield over it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yang Jian, you lost!” the demon king laughed madly, while absorbing the souls of the normal people around him without any restraint. Then, he set his gaze upon Ye Zichen, “Fallen… Come with me to the demon realm!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The huge hand in the sky reached towards Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian immediately roared, “Bro, run!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Ye Zichen also felt like something locked onto him. He wanted to leave, but he noticed that it was as if someone casted a Body-Freezing Spell on him, causing him to not be able to move at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come with me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Holy Illumination!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment, a blinding holy light shone in the west. When the holy light shone onto the demon king, his body immediately broke down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, a clear yell also sounded out in the sky, “Yang Jian, what are you waiting for!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha, thanks!” Yang Jian smiled, he cut his lance towards the arm without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Splash.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Purplish red blood spurted all over the silver lance, while the huge arm fell down from the sky, causing suffocating dust to splash everywhere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahhh…” the demon king held his broken arm with his left hand. Then, before he could even react, Yang Jian charged towards him with the lance in hand once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The lance pierced towards the demon king’s chest in a trick manner…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The demon king grunted, then looked down and saw that Yang Jian’s lance had completely pierced his chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian forcefully twisted the lance, causing a huge hole to appear on the demon king’s chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh…” Purplish red blood flowed out continuously from the wound.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian squinted his eyes when he saw this.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Take advantage of his weakness!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The war lance stabbed into the demon king’s head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The demon king’s head exploded like an exploding watermelon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yang Jian, this king remembers you now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Contrary to Yang Jian’s expectation, the demon king actually managed to survive the blow. A huge spatial crack appeared in the sky, then the demon king leaped into the it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You want to run!?” Yang Jian charged with his lance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Ye Rong appeared by his side, then patted his shoulder and shook her head, “Don’t go, that is the Hellish Demon Realm, which the demons reside in. If you go… Not only you, it is even impossible for the Three Pure Ones to return alive.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you just now!” Yang Jian returned his body to normal, then cupped his hands towards Ye Rong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Rong shook her head with a smile, then turned around and flew towards Ye Zichen, “Zichen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She pulled him into her embrace, then checked him out with a worrying gaze. After a long time, she finally let out a long sigh of relief, “It’s great that you’re alright.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve caused you to worry,” Ye Zichen’s expression saddened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the Gu family head walked over. His blurry eyes shimmered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Rong saw him, a hint of depression also appeared on her face, “You’re also…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil-Lil’ Rong,” the Gu family head trembled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Rong’s shoulders shook intensely. Ye Zichen was able to feel just how much feelings went through Ye Rong’s heart at that moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she quickly calmed herself down, and spoke to the Gu family head with a smile, “Old Man Gu, this clown fiesta has come to an end. I am deeply sorry about the Gu clan’s loss. There was a pretty huge commotion this time. The Surveillance Committee might come over to question your clan tomorrow. You better clean this place up in order to prevent unnecessary trouble for the Gu clan. Oh yeah, when they investigate, please hide the appearance of Yang Jian and I.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Rong!” the Gu family head trembled, then sighed. “Are-Are you blaming me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you talking about?” Ye Rong smiled. “I just don’t want to get into that unnecessary mess. Yang Jian is also of the same mind. Don’t think too much into it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gu Rong, just treat it as father’s wrongs. Come back!” the Gu family head clenched his teeth and shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Rong’s expression stiffened for a moment, then she smiled wryly, “I think you’ve got the wrong person. My name is Ye Rong, not Gu Rong!”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Original Chapter Teaser:</b>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Shit! This is terrible. This guy is a lot stronger than I imagined to him. Since he wasn't one of those Gods who fought in the great war, I truly underestimated him quite a lot, and that cost me to lose my hand... I will kill you, Yang Jian!</p>
 <p>But then again, from the aura he's letting out, he's an Earth Immortal at best. He isn't impossible for me to slay. Haha, to slay a 'war god' from the Heavenly Court. My blood is boiling now!</p>
 <p>As long as I begin to use that technique, my strength will only increase. It was good for the demons to slaughter so many humans earlier. All of them will merely become nutrition for me. Ahh, I suppose pests have their uses too.</p>
 <p>Now, Yang Jian. You can die now!</p>
