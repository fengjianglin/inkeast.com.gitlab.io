 <p><span style>Chapter 687 – The Fall of Qiu Hai</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon felt a chill when he heard the casual greeting. </span><i><span style>I actually didn’t detect anyone coming towards me!?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I can even detect it if it was Qiu Hai.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just who is that person? How did he get around my senses? Why is he giving me so much pressure?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon raised his eyebrows and glanced forward. When he saw the person, his pupils contracted.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The trap.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It must have been all planned by him.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I apologize for not greeting you sooner when you visited. I wonder what did you come to Pool City for? Why don’t you come and have a chat with us in the halls?” the white-robed man made a please gesture.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qiu Hai couldn’t help but purse his lips and smiled, “So you didn’t return to the Upper Realms yet. Are those God Realm fellows provoking the existence of the Laws?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Listen to yourself. You didn’t return yet, so why should I?” a hint of laughter could be seen in the white-robed man’s eyes as he replied indifferently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qiu Hai’s expression shifted for a moment when he saw the look the white-robed man gave him, then snorted, “The cowardly small fry back then actually dares to act like this in front of me? I guess I really do have to make you remember what happened then.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Good, fight. I’ll reap the benefits. Oh, the Yellow Emperor’s reincarnation is here too. This really will be killing two birds with one stone. </span></i><span style>Black Dragon thought to himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The white-robed man shrugged, “I merely wanted to let the injured get treated quicker. Cowardly small fry? That’s a bit arrogant. I’ll be honest, I really don’t want us to fight right now, but since this is the case, then it can’t be helped.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A gust of wind blew past, causing their robes to flutter in the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The white-robed man smiled, then put on Huang Feihong’s signature pose[1. </span><a href="http://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~chlit130/images/jetli.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style>http://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~chlit130/images/jetli.jpg</span></a><span style>], while spiritual energy started to spiral around him…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The seemingly meager spiritual instantly soared out like a surging torrent and pressed down towards Black Dragon and Qiu Hai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a suffocating feeling, and the moment the pressure appeared, Black Dragon’s eyes were filled with an unbelievable shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pressure he felt was more than ten times stronger than what he felt when he had arrived in the city’s territory.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Qiu Hai’s eyes twitched. Although he was a Sky Supreme, he still felt a chilling pressure and a hint of danger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was something he had only felt from the Demon Emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, be careful later. This geezer is no weakling. I might not be able to protect you while I’m fighting with him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The white-robed man reminded Ye Zichen through his sea of consciousness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded towards the man, then slowly backed off.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>They were finally going to fight!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Qiu Hai laughed coldly. Pressure did not mean everything. He would only know the man’s true strength after they fought. What’s more, the Lower Three Realm’s Law limited things so that the highest level of strength that could be used was that of a first ranked Sky Supreme’s. Qiu Hai did not believe that he would be the weaker amongst the two when that’ the case.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, puny small fry!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Qiu Hai also released a powerful surge of spiritual energy from his body, which glittered with a purple light. The mirage of a demon holding two hammers seemed to be mixed amongst the energy, which glared at the white-robed man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the white-robed man stopped holding back. He released a powerful pale blue aura around him. Then a giant image of a sea god holding a trident appeared and stared at the opposing demon mirage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A lion should use its full strength even against a rabbit. The white-robed man was not about to overestimate himself and get destroyed for that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let me tell you this first. I don’t have a good impression of you demons. If I wound you gravely or kill you, please understand that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sea god behind him rose its trident high, while water attribute spiritual energy gathered towards the weapon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The demon behind Qiu Hai did the same. It crossed its hammers and began to let marks appear on them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qiu Hai began to feel more and more pressure from the white-robed man, and this pressure also ate away at his fighting spirit. When Qiu Hai finally couldn’t take it anymore, he chose to attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What a shame, he lost.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, the turtle chancellor shook his head with a sigh in a corner outside Pool City.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That demon geezer’s avatar is a primordial demon… What a talented person. I wonder if the demons will be outraged when he dies here,” then he shrugged and continued his mutterings. “But so what. The best thing that’ll happen is if all the demons die. As for the guy he’s facing. He should be the one His Majesty was talking about. A primordial sea god avatar… That’s clearly not the strength a Sky Supreme should have. Oh my, His Majesty is clearly just making things difficult for me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Qiu Hai’s demon avatar swung its hammer towards the white-robed man. Yet, it was like the turtle chancellor said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He lost!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The white-robed man suddenly opened his eyes, while the sea god behind him pointed towards the demon avatar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then…</span></p>
 <p><span style>A hole ripped through the demon avatar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The demon avatar crumbled, while Qiu Hai also knelt down in the sky and spat out a mouthful of blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He opened his eyes wide in shock and glanced at the shimmering avatar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How’s this possible!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His avatar was a primordial demon, and that made him a rarity even in the Demon Realm. That was something he had gotten from Black Dragon by chance when he descended, it was supposed to turn his life around…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>But how!?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I lost.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>My primordial demon actually lost to this wave-riding person with a crown on its head and scales on its arm!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Impossible!” Qiu Hai roared with bloodshot eyes. He struggled to stand up and resummoned his avatar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop trying. The sea god is a primordial god. Your avatar has already been shattered,” the white-robed man slowly walked towards Qiu Hai, while the avatar behind him began to disperse. At the same time, the man’s robe begun to turn blue, a crown appeared on his head, and the sea god’s trident appeared in his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“H-How do you know this, that’s…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You understand now?” the white-robed man smirked and lifted the trident high. “Yes, it is as you said. Do you feel like it is a reasonable death now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, I can’t die! My ambition…” Qiu Hai scuttled back frantically.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The white-robed man sighed, then through the trident out like a spear and pierced it through Qiu Hai. “I told you already. I don’t like demons.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qiu Hai stopped breathing and fell on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The white-robed man dispelled his own condition, then glanced down at a place outside Pool City.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He noticed me!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The turtle chancellor gulped, then ran. </span><i><span style>I definitely won’t be able to complete the mission now. His Majesty didn’t give me a time limit, so let’s just wait and see.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Hah…” the white-robed man smirked, then looked towards Black Dragon, who was preparing to run. “You want to run? Why leave so quickly when you’re already here?”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Original Chapter Teaser:</strong>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>What on earth!? Why didn't I sense him? When did they get up here? This makes no sense!</p>
 <p>Just... How strong is he to appear out of nowhere like that?</p>
 <p>What's more... This man... He's the one who shocked me back then. The one who... Back in the Demon Realm...</p>
 <p>But Qiu Hai should be able to face him. That old geezer did scare him away back then... Since that's the case, then I'll let them fight. It'll be great. If they end up killing each other, or at least heavily wounding each other... Then I can get rid of both of them and capture the Yellow Emperor's reincarnation!</p>
