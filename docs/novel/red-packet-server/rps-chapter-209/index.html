 <p><span style>Chapter 209 – Earning Reputation</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You guys think so as well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen ignored the triangular-eyed brat, and looked towards the middle-aged couple behind the young man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We-We…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, I truly feel depressed for the person inside the operation room.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen smiled apologetically towards Huang Ming and Deng Chen, then took out his chequebook to write a series of numbers on it before tearing the cheque out to throw into the family’s hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is your compensation. I’m not going to do this operation!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A commotion among the people outside the operation room immediately exploded out wwhen the cheque was thrown into the middle-aged woman’s hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The triangular-eyed young man tried his best to fight for it, and during so, he even pushed the middle-aged lady to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little friend Zichen,” Deng Cheng couldn’t help but speak up since he did not expect Ye Zichen to actually make such a choice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just treat this as a medical accident. Liu Qianqian failed the operation and compensated the patient’s relatives. I’m out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, he pulled on Liu Qianqian’s hand and walked towards the exit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen-ge,” Huang Ming suddenly stopped Ye Zichen with a pleading look in his eyes. “I sought you out to ask you to help!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s there to help for such a family?” Ye Zichen’s eyes revealed a chilling gaze. Seeing that, Huang Ming clenched his teeth and kicked the young man, who was still fighting for the cheuqe, onto the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is there only money in your eyes!?” Huang Ming roared angrily. The young man, who was kicked, immediately stood up and threw a punch at Huang Ming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey… I’m not going to allow you to hit my little brother!” Ye Zichen grabbed the man’s fist. At that moment, the middle-aged man, who had been silent until now, walked over with the wrinkled cheque.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please save my daughter, we don’t want this money, I want my daughter to live.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck you,” The triangular-eyed young man immediately cursed when he heard that, and shouted as he pointed at the middle-aged man. “Old guy, you better hand the money over to me now, otherwise I’m going to take your life!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The middle-aged man was clearly very afraid of his son, because he trembled when he heard the young man’s reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, he still replied as his murky eyes contained disappointment and heartache that could not be hidden, “Son, the one lying inside is your little sister!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk, she can be exchanged for several million if she dies. It’s worth it. I’m not a person without a conscience, I’ll find a good grave for her when she’s be buried…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the start, he thought this entire family was focused on money, but from the looks of it, it was only the young man that was a black sheep!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his hand and grabbed the young man’s arm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crack!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen dislocated the arm. Then he raised his foot to kick the young man’s stomach, causing the young man to be pushed towards the wall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Take control of him. Give me the sterile coat, I’m going to save the person.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll go with you,” Liu Qianqian bit her lips. She caused the medical accident, so if it was possible to mend the issue, she wanted to help as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just stay here properly, my cute senior.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Half an hour later…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The door to the operation room was pushed open as Ye Zichen walked out with a relaxed look from the inside. Then, he took off the sterile coat and chucked it to Deng Cheng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Success?” Deng Cheng raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen speechlessly rolled his eyes, “When have you ever seen me fail?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, he spoke up once more, “Gramps, I’ve pretty much become a specialist doctor here, shouldn’t you give me a bit of salary?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you want, then…” Deng Cheng immediately revealed the smile of a sly old fox. Seeing this smile, Ye Zichen’s heart raced…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Never mind, I’ll just be a volunteer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen-ge, Xuefu…” Huang Ming’s expression was full of worry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen chuckled softly, then patted his shoulders, “Saved, and I also cured her hidden illness while I was at it. What you wanted to buy that from me was for her, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm,” Huang Ming nodded seriously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nice, I can tell that it’s true love, being in love is a good thing, Zichen-ge wishes you the best,” With a chuckle, Ye Zichen started to leave after patting his shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, at that moment, the middle-aged woman, who had been pushed onto the floor spoke up, “Doctor, can you help my son attach his arm?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This sort of person…” To be honest, Ye Zichen didn’t want to, but he couldn’t help but sigh when he saw that woman’s begging look.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>A parent’s heart was truly admirable.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen walked to the young man’s side, the young man continued to gaze at him fiercely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you glare at me anymore, I’ll break your leg,” Ye Zichen truly looked down on this sort of people, thus he merely scared the grandson a bit, then pushed his arm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahh…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen intentionally used a more painful method to attack the brat’s arm. Then he snorted coldly before returning to Huang Ming’s side and said softly, “This brat isn’t a good person, take the girl’s parents over to your place when you have time!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood!” Huang Ming nodded. He knew that the brat wasn’t anything good, but he didn’t expect the young man to be so scummy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was no longer sleepy after the situation earlier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He took out his phone and eyed his WeChat as he stood in front of the flowerbed near the entrance of the hospital.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He did not expect there to be two system notifications on his screen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Helping the injured, saving a life. You have gained 1 Reputation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Doing good deeds, donating millions. You have gained 10 Reputation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen didn’t know how to react when he saw the system notifications.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Saving a life should be referring to the person within the operation room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Donating millions!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could Lin Hanben have done that? That brat truly donated quite a bit.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen was truly confused about what Reputation did.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>When a new mode came out in games, there would be a guide for the new function. However, for him, the system didn’t tell me about the new function at all.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>All he knew was that he had 12 Reputation to his name.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And nothing else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Ye Zichen was pondering about the use of Reputation, a white-cloaked woman suddenly appeared beside him!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was Liu Qianqian!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What a little intern like you running around instead of staying in the hospital properly?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows and returned his phone to his pocket. “Senior, it’s not that I’m scolding, but just intern when you’re an intern. What are you being the primary surgeon for? If we don’t have the ability, then don’t do that sort of thing. Say, it was fortunate that I came this time, if I didn’t, then wouldn’t you have been responsible? What’s more, that brat might even have extorted your dad out of his antique store.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know my wrongs,” Liu Qianqian lowered her head deeply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had asked to be the primary surgeon this time. Since she would follow surgeons for their operations daily, she always felt that her skills was no worse than those doctors. However, she only realized that she was too naïve after trying it out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She instantly panicked when blood spurted on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other doctors in the operation room immediately conducted emergency procedures, but…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you so much, if that paitent really died, then I would regret it for my entire life.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Enough, it’s not the first time I’ve helped you, Lucy!” Ye Zichen smiled meaningfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qianqian immediately blushed, “Can you stop mentioning about the Lucy thing? Alright, I am Lucy, didn’t I admit it last time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm!” Ye Zichen shrugged with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qianqian licked her lips, “Erm, can I treat you to…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s phone suddenly rang, so he took out his phone!</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a new system notification.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Original Chapter Teaser:&nbsp;</b>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Seriously, their family member is dying or dead in the operation room, and all they care about is money? I'm done, laozi isn't doing this anymore! Just pretend that the patient's dead, I'll just help&nbsp;<em>Lucy&nbsp;</em>compensate them.</p>
 <p><b>Deng Cheng:&nbsp;</b>That isn't a good thing, please lend us your aid.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Why should I? For them, they're like 90% of the rest of the world, money is the number one concern for them. Family, friends, face, and common courtesy. I mean, even a certain Chinese web novel monopolistic company in China is going international for money while completely disregarding their public image and goes and does shady things!</p>
 <p><b>Deng Cheng:&nbsp;</b>But that's a novel company, we're talking about a life or death situation with the patient here, surely...</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>I know what I'm doing. (whispers) I'm just trying to see which ones of them are the black sheep. Don't worry, regardless of what they say, I will save the patient, I just want to see how many of them still actually care.</p>
