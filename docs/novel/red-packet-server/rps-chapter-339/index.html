 <p><span style>Chapter 339 – Gu Li</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fatty!” Ye Zichen opened his eyes wide. At that moment, he was not in a hotel outside, he was in the capital’s Gu household, it isn’t a place that just anyone can enter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fact that the fatty actually appeared here, and from his tone…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Could you cause me less worry?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty Yin smiled faintly as he walked next to Ye Zichen and put his hand on top of Ye Zichen’s head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He released a wave of pure celestial spiritual energy, which was injected into Ye Zichen’s head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Puny demonic energy actually wants to block off this sovereign’s celestial spiritual energy!?” the fatty smiled mockingly, then pressed down again on Ye Zichen’s head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen spat out a mouthful of purplish red blood, which instantly burnt the floor to coal the instant it landed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, the roaring in Ye Zichen’s ears disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He let out a long sigh. Just slightly earlier, he thought that he would actually be killed by his Wind Catching Ear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can you stop causing me to worry so much from now on?” the fatty rolled his eyes in his annoyance. He glanced at the pitch black spot on the floor that emitted a stench before raising his eyebrows and covering his nose. “This stench…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How did you come to the Gu household?” Ye Zichen picked his ear. Then, after confirming that his ears were truly fine, he looked at up Fatty Yin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fatty smiled and shrugged, “I, Lord Fatty, come when I want. As for how… I naturally walked in of course!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The people from the Gu family didn’t stop you?” Ye Zichen asked in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty Yin instantly disappeared from the room in response, and only appeared after a short while, “Do you understand now? I, Lord Fatty, come in when I want and leave when I want. The heck is a puny Gu household to me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have always wondered about your identity. Just who are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fatty was truly too mysterious. Ye Zichen could tell from the fatty’s endless abilities that the fatty was definitely no normal person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, someone with two souls is naturally not a normal person.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>But what is his real identity? Why is he protecting me? Could he be someone from the Immortal Region of the Three Realms?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehehe, I, Lord Fatty, am not going to tell you,” Fatty Yin smiled. “Try it, you should be able to use celestial spiritual energy now.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Fiery Eyes of Truth, activate! </span></i><span style>Ye Zichen called out silently in his heart. Then, his eyes flared up with a faint golden light…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I really can use it!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, he quickly ran to the entrance of the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who is it!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The door was pushed open, revealing a boy with black-framed glasses sitting in a wheelchair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The boy’s timid face carried traces of terror as if he was shocked. He gripped the handle of the wheelchair tightly, then nodded towards Ye Zichen and Fatty Yin, who were in the room, “Hello.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hello? Brat, stop pretending in front of me! It was great fun trying to listen in on us from the outside just now, right?” Ye Zichen smiled faintly. “What? Did you come to gather enemy information?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty Yin also smiled.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>His vigilance is pretty good.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, the boy immediately put on a confused expression, “What are you saying? Listen in?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Keep pretending!” Ye Zichen smiled playfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think that you must have misunderstood,” the boy said with a warm smile. “Let me introduce myself. I am the youngest young master in the Gu family, Gu Li. I was just wandering around and passed by… As for gathering information, just look at me. I have no intention of fighting for the position of the junior family head at all. You should be an important person that one of my older brothers invited over, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Keep pretending!” Ye Zichen smiled. He walked up to the boy with his eyes squinted, then kicked the boy’s wheelchair. “Your legs are clearly fine. Why are you sitting in a wheelchair?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you doing?” Gu Li immediately fell onto the ground against Ye Zichen’s expectations. Gu Li’s face was covered in franticness, while his legs did not move at all, as if they were unable to feel anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sound that Ye Zichen produced attracted plenty of people, including Gu Tian…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Ye, what… Little brother!” Gu Tian quickly rushed in front of Gu Li, righted the wheelchair on the ground, then carried Gu Li onto the wheelchair. “Why aren’t you more careful?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tian-ge? Are these two your friends? This big brother said that I was listening in to their conversation just now, and I told them I didn’t. He then kicked me over and said that my legs were fine… Ha, I hope that my legs are completely fine too, then, I would be able to…” a self-mocking wry smile covered Gu Li’s face. Then, he said guiltily. “Should I not have come here? I’ve caused Tian-ge’s friends to misunderstand…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You did no wrong,” Gu Tian rubbed Gu Li’s head, then shouted with a frown. “Big Brother Ye!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?” Ye Zichen looked up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to ask you what is it. Why are you suspecting everything after arriving at the Gu household?” Gu Tian’s eyebrows knitted tightly together. “He is my little brother. His legs were heavily injured when he was young. Also, he isn’t involved in the election for the junior family head this time at all. Why did you… Just what!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shock surprised on Ye Zichen’s face. He was absolutely certain that the legs of the kid in front of him had no issue at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And just moments earlier, the brat was indeed listening in to their conversation in front of his door. Both of these were undeniable facts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t believe me?” Ye Zichen smiled faintly. “I don’t care who this brat is. He was clearly trying to listen in in front of my door! Otherwise, why would he come here… Gu Tian, don’t forget what I told you. You are trying to get elected to become the junior family head this time, so don’t be too naïve, okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is it me that’s too naïve, or is Big Brother Ye thinking too complicatedly!?” Gu Tian shouted with a frown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tian-ge, don’t get angry with this big brother. He is someone you invited to help you compete for the position of the junior family head. We must treat him with respect. Indeed, it is my bad for running over here during these sensitive times. But… Actually, I just wanted to come play with you, I…” Gu Li maintained his apologetic expression, but his words subtly revealed how troubled he felt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s cold smile became all the more obvious in response, “You said that you were wandering around earlier, and now it’s coming to play with Gu Tian?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Ye!” Gu Tian frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe…” A faint smile surfaced on Ye Zichen’s lips. He rolled his neck and walked in front of Gu Tian, then placed a hand on Gu Li’s shoulder, and turned to Gu Tian. “I’m not sure if you know, but my medical skills are top notch. Just a while back, I cured a patient who was born paralyzed… Birth paralysis should be much more severe than the situation of your little brother’s legs, right? How about I help him take a look? I might actually be able to cure his legs.”</span></p>

 <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Original Chapter Teaser:</b>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p><b>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</b>Ugh, no shit... Argh! Fatty! Why...</p>
 <p><strong>Fatty Yin:&nbsp;</strong>Sigh... Why am I here? Lord Fatty will be wherever he wants to be!</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>ARGH!</p>
 <p><strong>Fatty Yin</strong>: Alright, alright. I know you're in pain. Just give me a moment.&nbsp;<em>(put hands on Ye Zichen's head)&nbsp;</em>Abracadabra, pain pain, go away.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>It's... no... time... for... jokes...</p>
 <p><strong>Fatty Yin:&nbsp;</strong>Ahh yes, you're right.&nbsp;<em>(forces his own spiritual energy into Ye Zichen)&nbsp;</em>Puny demonic residue, how dare you stop Lord Fatty enter! Feel my wrath!</p>
 <p>(Ye Zichen faints)</p>
