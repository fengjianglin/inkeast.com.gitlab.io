 <p><span style>Chapter 153 – First Understanding of the Three Realms</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fact that the fatty was fine earlier, and then just instantly attacked without any prior notice completely shocked Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He leaped aside and dodged Third Fatty Jin’s attack, and sat down in a chair at the corner of the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you doing!?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows and shouted. </span><i><span style>Why did he attack me without saying anything? From the looks of things, he was pretty angry.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What!?” Third Fatty Jin clenched his teeth and glared at Ye Zichen, when he thought of being unable to return to Great Emperor Qingming’s side. “If it wasn’t for you, if it wasn’t for you… Lord Fatty must kill you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck, although laozi doesn’t want to fight with you, don’t think laozi’s a weakling!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then go ahead and try, Lord Fatty wants to see just what grandson is capable of!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You asked for it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen cracked his neck, then kicked out towards Third Fatty Jin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lord Fatty revealed a hint of disdain on his mouth when he saw the kick, and rushed over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With his power as a False Earth Immortal, it was easy to deal with a small fry that had just barely brushed against the level of a False Spiritual Body!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Easy…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wait, that’s not right.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why am I flying?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A huge noise rang out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The scene in his mind he expected did not appear. Lord Fatty fell to the floor with an expression of confusion.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s going on?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>No matter what, I am a False Earth Immortal, why couldn’t I beat a False Spiritual Body?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He clenched his fists, then closed his eyes to feel the spiritual power within his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rustle</span></p>
 <p><span style>His expression turned stark white.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Gone!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s all gone!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t have any spiritual power left at all!</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he thought back on his esteemed master’s words, if there were no surprises, then Great Emperor Qingming should have sealed his immortal spiritual power!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen walked over with his hands in his pockets when he saw the fatty fall to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fatty, are you a rabid dog!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A murderous light flashed in Third Fatty Jin’s eyes when he saw Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>If it wasn’t for the brat in front of me, I would already be staying in the Qingming Hall, listening to the songs sung by my maidservants and enjoying my life.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>That’s great now, I can’t return to the Qingming Hall and my spiritual powers are all gone.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You still have the face to call yourself laozi,” Lord Fatty clenched his teeth and stood up from the ground. “Laozi can’t return to the Qingming Hall now, and laozi’s spiritual power has been sealed by Esteemed Master… I…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you want to do?” Ye Zichen glared at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His spiritual power was all gone, so at that moment, Third Fatty Jin was no different from a normal person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wasn’t stupid enough to try and fight head to head against Ye Zichen, don’t talk about unable to gain anything, wouldn’t he be at a loss if he had to lie on the ground and get beaten up?</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, he was foreign to this place in the Modern World. He needed to rely on this brat to even survive.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Decision made!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Submit!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Submitting leads to a bright future!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-dage, my Esteemed Master told me to stay in the Modern World and follow you. You are my big bro from now on.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In terms of the ability to see which way the wind blows, if he, Lord Fatty, dared to claim second, then no one would dare to claim to be first.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This sudden change in Third Fatty Jin’s attitude completely shocked Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You called me big bro just now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>“Yeah, from now on, you are my, Third Fatty Jin’s big bro. From now on, I, your little bro, will follow your lead, sacrifice myself for you on the battlefield, succeed for you, horse… <a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p><span style>“… Speak, continue speaking.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big bro, little bro’s education is limited, I only know these few proverbs,” Third Fatty Jin lowered his head remorsefully with a coy smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, stop kissing laozi’s ass here. I don’t want to ask too much about what the hell Great Emperor Qingming is planning. From the looks of it, you’re rather pitiful. Since Great Emperor Qingming told you to follow me, then I naturally will allow you to stay. I’ll say one thing, following laozi will bring good fortune for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s for sure, little bro believes what big bro says!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Fatty Jin had truly positioned himself as Ye Zichen’s subordinate, it was very hard to imagine that until just a few moments ago, he was addressing himself as Lord Fatty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm, sit, you can tell me just what do those Rogue Immortals do.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rogue Immortals? That’s a long story.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then be concise!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes in annoyance. When Third Fatty Jin felt the displeasure in his big bro’s tone, he immediately nodded with a coy smile, “Okay, then I’ll be concise.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though Sanpang compressed everything as much as he could, he still spent a bit more than an hour in order to explain all of Ye Zichen’s queries.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So, what was a Rogue Immortal?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rogue Immortals were titles given to mortals that had gained immortal spiritual power through cultivation and became deities or immortals. They were more or less the same as the cultivators that novels spoke about.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The land that Ye Zichen resided in was called the Modern World by the Rogue Immortals!</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were rather few deities or immortals residing in the Modern World, only some Rogue Immortal families would leave a few immortals behind for a last resort!</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the other Rogue Immortals would ascend to the Rogue Immortal’s region within the Immortal Realm to live.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rogue Immortals were split into clear levels.</span></p>
 <p><span style>False Spiritual level, Spiritual level, False Earth Immortal, Earth Immortal, False Sky Immortal, Sky Immortal, True Immortal (Immortal King)…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Each level would be split into the early, mid, late, and complete stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Furthermore, the Heavenly Court, Underworld and Rogue Immortals were the three largest factions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These three factions all had families that worshipped them in the Modern World…</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen thought of Great Emperor Qingming, Taibai Jinxing and those guys in the Underworld…</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed like he would have to be a triple agent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The film of the century!</span></p>
 <p><span style>An agent, who’s a double agent, who’s an agent. Coming to your theatres soon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for everything else!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just one thing!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It was useless!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Why did Ye Zichen think that? Ye Zichen was just a mere mortal, he didn’t have any of those secret scriptures that the Rogue Immortal families left behind for cultivation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Treasure Shop of the Heavenly Court didn’t seem to have those sort of books either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, Third Fatty Jin said that he was at the False Spiritual level, which was the first level of a Rogue Immortal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen didn’t know how he reached it at all. It seemed like he merely ate a Level Six Celestial Pill made by Old Lord Taishang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>More importantly…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t want to be any sort of Rogue Immortal, he just wanted to peacefully earn money and live a good life in this Modern World.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At most, he would just be more careful when he was being a spy, and gather more good stuff.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He’ll just leave when he’d gotten enough, he didn’t want to get into that mess.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big bro, big bro…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Fatty Jin waved a few times in front of Ye Zichen’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen came back to his senses and raised his eyebrows with a smile, ‘Not bad, you spoke in a pretty detailed manner.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, naturally, these are all things little bro should do.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Fatty Jin smiled like a grandson. Ye Zichen felt like he couldn’t treat the fatty badly, and took out his phone in preparation to get him a meeting gift from the Heavenly Court’s Treasure Shop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Ye Zichen was completely shut down during the past week, he pretty much had had no contact with the outside world, and naturally did not go on WeChat as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment he logged on WeChat, the amount of messages nearly caused his phone to break due to all the vibrations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He took a glance at the various messages.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao, Erlang Shen, and Third Prince Nezha all sent him messages.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, what caught his attention the most was Great Sage Sun’s message.</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>Monkey King: Bro, I, Old Sun, caught a yaoguai <a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>.</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: Bro, I, Old Sun, got screwed over by a bunch of foolish peasants.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: Bro, I, Old Sun, was arrested by a bunch of people in blue uniforms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: Bro…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s heart thumped when he saw the news.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had spent too much time thinking stuff that he actually forgot about the ticking time bomb known as the Great Sage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the looks of it, big trouble had occurred.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen quickly replied, but his message did not get a reply as if it was a rock that sank to the bottom of the ocean.</span></p>
