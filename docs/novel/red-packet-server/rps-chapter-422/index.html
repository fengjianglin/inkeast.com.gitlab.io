 <p><span style>Chapter 422 – Old Lord Taishang wants the Treasure</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within the old Dragon God’s subdimension.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dragon mirage on Ye Zichen, who was sitting cross-legged on the floor, began to solidify, while endless Dragon Force seemed to spiral around Ye Zichen’s body, causing the old Dragon God to exclaim silently.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is he really human?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Dragon Soul, solidify!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Ye Zichen shouted out, the dragon mirage behind him begun to solidify further. At that moment, others could already clearly tell the patterns on the dragon, while its whiskers also moved with the wind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Roar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A loud roar sounded out from the dragon, while Ye Zichen also stood up and threw the dragon race’s secret manual up to the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m more or less done. There are still somethings I have to go back and think about.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is your fifth time solidifying the soul, right?” the old Dragon God asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded, “Mm, but solidifying it nine times is truly too hard. I wanted to try solidifying for the sixth time just now, but I got no clue as to how to approach it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The fact that you’ve solidified the soul five times in less than a month’s time means that your talent is shockingly good,” the old Dragon God did not hold back his praise towards Ye Zichen at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen merely nodded plainly without any excess reactions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You seemed to have been through something again. You seem a lot more poised.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm,” Ye Zichen nodded with a smile, then stretched lazily. “Send me out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen, who laid on the bed, opened his eyes once again, he saw Xuan-Yuan Xiang lay on top of him in an extremely embarrassing posture, while she glanced at him with bright eyes filled with curiosity…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where did you go just now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can you get off me first?” Ye Zichen pointed at their embarrassing posture.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xuan-Yuan Xiang immediately smiled teasingly, then pinched Ye Zichen’s cheek, “You’re still shy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xuan-Yuan Xiang flipped around and laid onto the bed. At that moment, all she wore was clothing as thin as a veil, causing her voluptuous bodyline to be faintly in sight. Furthermore, her posture was also extremely alluring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fortunately, Ye Zichen could hold himself back. What’s more, due to getting used to Xuan-Yuan Xiang being like that after a long time, he disregarded it completely and raised his eyebrows, “Where’s Tenner?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m here,” the little boy, Tenner, suddenly stood up from beside the bed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen took a glance at the floor, and found that Tenner was actually playing with toy bricks and Transformers, both of which children loved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, he was not as meek and scared of strangers as he was originally, and seemed to radiate a lively aura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes, half a month had already passed since Ye Zichen drew out Xuan-Yuan Sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In this half a month, Ye Zichen, Xuan-Yuan Xiang and Tenner always stayed together. The two latter ones seemed to take upon the position that Liu Qing once took.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the difference was that Xuan-Yuan Xiang liked to tease him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Liu Qing…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I wonder how she is now.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiang-jie, look at this. Aren’t I amazing?” Tenner jumped onto the bed and yanked Xuan-Yuan Xiang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She raised her eyebrows and looked at the pile of toy bricks…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She moved her fingers slightly, instantly creating a building block that was several times as tall as Tenner’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little fellow, you’ve still got a long way to go. Go... Keep on playing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiang-jie’s still more amazing,” the little boy opened his eyes wide at the building block that was even taller than him and blinked. Then, he jumped off the bed then started to get excited by himself again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you telling him to play with toy bricks all the time? Isn’t this slowing down his cultivation progress?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the day after she called Tenner out, Xuan-Yuan Xiang told Ye Zichen to buy him a pile of toy blocks, and during the half a month’s worth of time, Tenner didn’t really do anything else except stack toy blocks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What cultivation progress does he even need?” Xuan-Yuan Xiang twitched her mouth, then pointed at her own chest. “Big Sis is the one focusing on attack. He focuses on defense. Playing with toy bricks can improve his concentration, which is good training for his mental strength.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So it’s like that.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The phrase “having an elder at home is like having a treasure” is really true. </span></i><span style>Ye Zichen felt like the pressure upon him decreased a lot after gaining Xuan-Yuan Xiang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xuan-Yuan Xiang was able to explain a lot of things he didn’t understand to him, and she would also teach him things he didn’t know.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh yeah, you didn’t tell me what you did just now,” Xuan-Yuan Xiang flipped over, then wrapped the soft dress underneath her, instantly revealing her long and beautiful legs in front of Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen yanked the dress back out from underneath her dress and covered Xuan-Yuan Xiang’s legs once again before replying, “I went to a sub dimension and cultivated using some body tempering secret manual.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little fellow, I’m beginning suspecting you of being gay. A normal man wouldn’t like act like that. A huge beauty is laying by your side and even showing her legs, and you actually covered them up,” Xuan-Yuan Xiang continuously retorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen merely rolled his eyes, and let her entertain herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What a pitiful child,” Xuan-Yuan Xiang shook her head softly as if she has already judged Ye Zichen of being homosexual. She ran her fingers through her bangs, then spoke up again. “You did gain plenty of opportunities. Sub Dimension and secret body tempering technique. Bring me over to take a look the next time you go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You won’t be able to go,” Ye Zichen immediately replied. “He just allowed me to go, so why are you following me over for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re such an idiot, I’m there to back you up… Can you be certain that the secret techniques he’s giving you are good ones? I’ll just go and beat the shit out of him, and force him to give you the best secret body tampering techniques. Think about how much effort that’ll save,” Xuan-Yuan Xiang giggled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen did not even think about hurting her feelings after hearing what she said.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Beat the shit of out him.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>The old Dragon God might be able to send us flying with a casual sneeze, and she’s telling me to think about beating him up?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, when Ye Zichen thought about this elder sister’s attacking attribute, he could only nod with a smile and not reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Look at your damn face, I’m just doing it for your own good!” Xuan-Yuan Xiang glared, then took out his phone from underneath the pillow and chucked it at Ye Zichen. “Here, someone called Old Lord Taishang sent you a friend request. I just checked your group chats out, you’ve got the Heavenly Court one and the Underworld one… I don’t want to know how you came into contact with them, but I do want to remind you that you are someone of the Rogue Immortal’s Immortal Region. I suggest you not to get too close with these people.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was clear that Xuan-Yuan Xiang wanted to reminded him of the relationships between the Three Realms is not that great. If the others knew about his identity, then it could cause a lot of unnecessary troubles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, all of his profits originated from that, if he were to cut off his ties with them…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, it was fine as long as he treads more carefully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clicked on his friend list, and saw that Old Lord Taishang’s friend request was at the very top of the list. That was not the first time this stubborn old man added him after deleting him. </span><i><span style>I wonder what he’s adding me again for.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Accept.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, this old man was a bit impulsive then. Please don’t take it to heart.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Ye Zichen accepted the notification, Old Lord Taishang immediately sent him a message. The fact that the old man actually admitted his wrongs proactively stunned Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not that petty,” Ye Zichen replied plainly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang sent another message over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, stop messing with this old man. Hurry up and send me the real treasure.”</span></p>
 <p></p>
