 <p><span style>Chapter 6 – Giving a private packet to Great Sage Sun</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun saw Ye Zichen’s strange reaction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, he parked the car by the side of the road and asked with raised eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothing, just drive.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen waved his hand towards him, but his eyes continued to stare at the friend request on the screen, while he was unsure of what to do.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had a pretty much had a good understanding of this group, they were definitely a group of deities.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was already a bug that a mere mortal like him had gotten in. Does the Monkey King suddenly adding him as a friend mean that his good days were coming to an end?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck, if it’s something good, then it isn’t trouble; if it’s trouble, then it can’t be avoided.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clenched his teeth and chose to accept it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just after accepting the friend request, the Monkey King sent a message over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I, Old Sun, have been paying attention to you for quite a while. You snatch red packets everyday without saying anything. What, are you afraid of them making you send red packets?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He even added four smirk emojis behind it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s heart jumped as he looked at the words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he didn’t reply in a satisfying way, then it might be over for him!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as he was hesitating about how to reply, the Monkey King sent another message over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, I, Old Sun, am not someone that would do something that would take a loss. You just got the secret scripture for my Fiery Eyes of Truth. Although you definitely won’t successfully learn it, you should clearly know that I, Old Sun, relies on this to be like a fish with water in the Heavenly Court. Shouldn’t you show some goodwill?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After this, he showed two smirk emojis again.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Some goodwill!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Does it mean that Great Sage Sun found him to get a private packet?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen felt rather helpless. He didn’t know what he should send at all. He can’t exactly send a hundred kuai to Great Sage Sun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Great Sage Sun wouldn’t be able to use it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Intimacy Mode activated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Intimacy Levels: Cold, Friendly, Trusted, Respect, Worship.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King’s current intimacy level: Friendly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen saw that there was “Intimacy Level: Friendly (100)” behind the Monkey King’s name on their chat. He was 100 from Trusted.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the hell was this intimacy level?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, judging from the way the Monkey King was talking to him, it was friendly, so it means that it probably wouldn’t be found out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The most important thing right now was how he was supposed to send a private red packet to the Monkey King!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you pretending to be AFK with I, Old Sun? Fine, Old Sun will @ you in the group.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen definitely knew about Great Sage Sun’s bad temper, due to watching Journey to the West since he was young. If he doesn’t satisfy this monkey, this “Friendly” might become “Cold”.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He definitely had to calm him down right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great Sage Sun, wait a moment, this little deity will immediately send it to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s more like it, hurry up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Monkey King pretty much replied instantaneously with three sunglasses emoji behind it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clicked on “send red packet” with the mindset of just trying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was different from him normally sending red packets, after clicking on it, the screen immediately showed a square like the one used to scan QR codes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen slapped his thigh with force. </span><i><span style>F*ck, after thinking about it for so long, it’s actually like this.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>There wasn’t anything he could really send to Great Sage Sun at the moment. Judging from Great Sage Sun’s personality, Ye Zichen thought that he probably likes some nice things to eat or fun things to play with.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop at the store in front of us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun was completely confused. Ye Zichen had been weird even since he got in the car. Su Yiyun really would have been freaked out by Ye Zichen’s sudden actions if his mentality wasn’t that good.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to buy a bit of stuff to eat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, Su Yiyun parked the car in front of the store. Ye Zichen hurriedly ran inside, then ran out again a short time later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he came out, he held a row of Wahaha Calcium Milk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you buy this for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun asked with a surprised expression the moment Ye Zichen got on the car.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t mind me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, the Monkey King’s temper rose again. In just three minutes time, there were ten-odd messages all hurrying Ye Zichen to send to the red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He clicked on “send red packet”, and the scanner appeared once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Buddha, bless me, this has to succeed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Scanning. Successfully recognized.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A pure red packet immediately appeared on the screen.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Haha, it really worked!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The Monkey King received your red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that the product arrived, Ye Zichen swallowed. That is so f*cking amazing, it really could send it over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the most important thing right now was to explain to Great Sage Sun about how Wahaha should be drunk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Using approximately three minutes time, Ye Zichen explained about how Wahaha should be drunk. To which, the Monkey King replied “I’ll give it a shot”, then disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Daoist friend, what kind of treasure is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Ye Zichen looked at what the Monkey King asked, the corner of his mouth slowly lifted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had truly judged correctly, this Monkey King really likes this sort of stuff.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is something that this little deity found from a certain secret place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you have anymore, send Old Sun a bit more.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Treasures are naturally rare. The ones sent to Great Sage was all that this little deity had left.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk, petty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Monkey King added three contempt emojis behind it, clearly showing that he didn’t believe what Ye Zichen said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, Old Sun is going to leave some to drink. Old Sun is very satisfied about your red packet, so Old Sun won’t @ you in the group.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you, Great Sage.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King’s intimacy level with you has increased by 30, you still require 70 to reach Trusted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Ye Zichen didn’t know what exactly intimacy level was used for, but it looked like a high intimacy level was definitely useful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This encounter with the Monkey King allowed Ye Zichen to learn how to send private red packets, so it seemed like his life in the WeChat group would be even more interesting in the future.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, the most important thing was the secret scripture for the Fiery Eyes of Truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Treasure Chest, withdraw.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Do you want to learn the secret scripture – Fiery Eyes of Truth?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A light flashed in front of his eyes, then immediately afterwards, Ye Zichen felt that his eyes were much more clear. However, there didn’t seem to be anything else that was special.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He turned towards Su Yiyun and looked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Flowered boxers.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>No no.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Why can he see the boxers he was wearing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen quickly opened his eyes and clenched his first. Damn, this Fiery Eyes of Truth is really amazing!</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he can use it on the school beauty, Su Yan…</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, Ye Zichen had a lecherous look on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The place Su Yiyun brought Ye Zichen to was an antique street. This street would sell antiques all year long, but most of them were fakes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you bring me here for, I can’t afford anything!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you mean you can’t afford it, these are all counterfeits, if you like something, then I’ll give you an entire truck of them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun replied indifferently. Hearing that, Ye Zichen momentarily blanked.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Counterfeits.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>When he glanced over these antiques with his Fiery Eyes of Truth, he was unable to tell if they were real or fake due to never seeing the difference between them before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Look around here for a moment, I’m going to get a friend. I’ll introduce you later.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Su Yiyun left, Ye Zichen started wandering around on the antique street.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Su Yiyun had told him that these were all fakes, he merely looked around from an appreciation angle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, have a look to see how much this vase can sell for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A foreign accent caught Ye Zichen’s attention. To be more precise, it was the vase in his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This vase was different from the other products on the antique street. There was a faint purple aura surrounding it.</span></p>
