 <p><span style>Chapter 639 – Going to the Sacred Land</span></p>
 <p><span style>One hit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled as he looked at Yin Xiong, who fell down onto the ground. </span><i><span style>He’s probably quite pissed.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>He said that he was going to beat me with one hit so confidently, but the result was the complete opposite.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>All of the audiences were all dumbstruck. Luo Wei, who was helping others in maintaining the barrier sighed softly, then glanced over at Ye Zichen with a frown. However, in the end, he still merely shook his head and did not do anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Will Yin Xiong…” Mu Cheng and Zuo Hongxin walked over and asked carefully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yin Xiong was a very reputed young man in the Hundred Flower Gate and was representing the seniors of the sect. They would be in a very troubled situation if anything happened to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but twitch his mouth when he saw their nervous looks, “He won’t die, but he’ll have to stay in bed for a few days.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s good, that’s good,” Zuo Hongxin muttered repeatedly, then called over some attendants to carry Yin Xiong to a guest room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Zuo Mo also ran over in excitement, while a hint of tears could still be seen in her delicate eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, you cared me to death just now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t have faith in me? This sort of tiny situation…” Ye Zichen rubbed her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Qingcheng and Mu Chengtian also walked over, “My older sister was very worried about you. I wonder when I’ll be able to give you a toast.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s none of your business,” Zuo Mo squinted her eyes at Zuo Qingcheng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noticing that, Zuo Qingcheng no longer stuck around to get angry at and merely turned around to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Ye, I thought that what I got in Mount Supreme was great enough. I didn’t expect that even though you didn’t stay too long in Mount Supreme, you had became even stronger than me,” Ruan Qingtian, who haven’t been seen for a long time, walked out from the crowds. Judging from the spiritual energy fluctuation around him, he had broken through to the Sky Immortal level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Ruan, congratulations for reaching the Sky Immortal level.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How is this a joyous thing? I was clearly stronger than you initially, but you’ve already left me behind now,” Ruan Qingtian couldn’t help but smile wryly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen did not continue to dwell on the subject and merely raised his eyebrows, “What’s the situation with Mount Supreme now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s nothing special. It’s just like what the senior who took you away said. The seals around Mount Supreme were removed, so those without keys are now able to enter. There should be plenty of people who are trying to get lucky in Mount Supreme right now,” Ruan Qingtian smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded, “Qiu Yuan still didn’t come out?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There must be some worldly sign when he comes out, right? No matter what, it is the inheritance of a Supreme, so he should be at the Immortal King level at worst. I’ll have to be honest, I’m rather envious. Oh, I do want to ask you, did you intentionally tell that senior to say that since you wanted to give the inheritance to Qiu Yuan…? It isn’t just me, a lot of other people are saying that,” Ruan Qingtian asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled wryly, “I’m not that sort of person. He is the Chosen One.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then he’s really lucky,” Ruan Qingtian couldn’t help but shake his head, then glanced over at Zuo Qingcheng and Mu Chengtian. “They actually got together? Zuo Mo, it seems like your competition will be tough during the tower head election!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, I really don’t think much of them,” Zuo Mo always maintained her strong attitude and confidence in front of others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ruan Qingtian smiled, they’ve known each other for quite a while, so he naturally understood her very well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s phone rang. He subconsciously touched his pocket, then smiled at the two near him before heading over to a place without many people to take his phone out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, there was no message when he clicked on the chatting app.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Was I hearing things?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, just as he was about to put his phone away, he saw a system notification.</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: When are you going to the Immortal Region?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, it’s you. I naturally have my plans. You don’t need to watch me so closely right? Can’t you give me some personal space?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: I’m helping you complete the main mission. Say, stop considering things, I’ll help you make the choice. I’ll open up a portal to the Immortal Region later. Just go in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was speechless. </span><i><span style>He’s actually making decisions for me now.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>”Hey, are we that close?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: Don’t be like that. Think about our connection, I definitely won’t screw you over. You’ll definitely be fine if you follow the plot I planned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then tell me why do I need to go to the Immortal Region right now?” Ye Zichen shrugged. “I’m not familiar with them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: You will be after you meet then, right? What’s more, you’re going to have to go over there sooner or later. No matter what, you are the Yellow Emperor’s reincarnation, it really isn’t right if you don’t go over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: Now, be a good boy and go.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then tell me what do I gain from doing that,” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes, then smiled craftily. “I have been listening to you the entire time. You told me to earn cultivation experience, and so I did. I also gained tons of intimacy levels. But I have an insane amount of cultivation experience right now, you have to give me something to spend it, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: Stop worrying, your cultivation experience will definitely be used one day. Insane amount… Even if you include that industrial region in the Heavenly Court, do you even have five hundred million cultivation experience? I think not!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, Ye Zichen carefully estimated a little…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I really don’t have five hundred million cultivation experience.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But… it’s still more than enough to buy all the treasures in the Treasure Shop with what I have.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did you tell me to earn so much cultivation experience? I want to buy the treasures in the Treasure Shop.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: Buy your ass. They aren’t really useful for you right now, or even in the future. Just keep earning cultivation experience, a time will come when you’ll need a huge amount of it in the future.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since the system notification phrased it like that, Ye Zichen could only let out a sigh, then keep on trusting the system.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as he was pondering about whether he should go to the Immortal Region, a red packet appeared on the screen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What tricks are you trying to pull this time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was extremely careful with this due to the chocolate he got last time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: What tricks can I pull with you? This is your Xuan-Yuan Sword. I have already unsealed fifty percent of the seals, but I still have some stuff to deal with here, so I can’t bring it over to you. Put Xuan-Yuan Sword into the Treasure Chest, then only take it out when you reach the Immortal Region.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: Xuan-Yuan Sword is the strongest primordial divine artifact with power surpassing even that of the East Emperor’s Bell. If you draw out the Xuan-Yuan Sword, which had fifty percent of its seals undone, the unnatural effects it draws will definitely catch the attention of those guys up there. But it’s different if you go to the Immortal Region. The Upper Three Realms don’t dare to try and do anything with a divine artifact belonging to the sacred land of the Immortal Region.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows, then couldn’t help but frown. “What sort of magical place is the sacred land of the Immortal Region? It’s actually enough to make those from the Upper Three Realms wary…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: Don’t ask about what you shouldn’t. I have no time to explain. Now, go to the sacred land.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, a black portal appeared in front of Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It led directly to the sacred land!</span></p>
