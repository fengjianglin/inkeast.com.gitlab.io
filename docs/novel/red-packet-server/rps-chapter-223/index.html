 <p><span style>Chapter 223 – Announcing the Relationship</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the first time Ye Zichen saw a deity send a voice message since he had begun to deal with the Heavenly Court and the Underworld.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clicked on the voice message curiously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did Sky Sovereign spread the news?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes! I’m so sorry!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen did not hide it. If they were to talk of the origin of the news, it was from him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your affability level with Chang’e increased by 1000. Current affability level: 1015.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your Red String with Chang’e has changed. Current Red String is identified as a Marriage String.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Damn!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>An affability level increase of 1000!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stared at the notification in shock, then looked at the Marriage String, that resided in the Treasure Chest.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It seriously changed!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“There is no need for Sky Sovereign to apologize to me. I suppose it’s good that it went public.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a very soft voice that had a bit of faint shyness mixed in with the coldness. More importantly, her reply…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I suppose it’s good that it went public!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Before Ye Zichen could reply, he saw that in the Heavenly Court group…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chang’e mentioned you in the group chat.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck, it seems like I’m definitely going to end up with a grudge with the male deities in the Heavenly Court!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Chang’e: @Only Idealism.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reactions of the deities in the group were nearly identical. If it had to be described with one word, it would be…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Exploded!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: Watching intently on the front row. It seems like they’re going to announce their relationship.</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>God of Thunder: It seems like we’re going to be stuffed with dog food. <a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p><span style><span>Mother of Lightning: Are you trying to say that you’re single? <a id="footnoteref-2" href="#footnote-2">[2]</a></span></span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: No, I don’t dare. I’m merely giving a moment of silence for the many old young men in the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Heavenly Soldier A: Although I just got married a few days ago, I still feel sad for the goddess just announcing her relationship like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Heavenly Soldier B: Brothers, don’t cry, before getting Chang’e’s reply of confirmation, we still have a chance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chang’e: Everyone, give me a moment please, I have something to say.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The group instantly turned silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chang’e: @Only Idealism, let’s come straight out with it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen felt very troubled when he saw the message.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Come straight out!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wouldn’t I be f*cking beaten to death!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, Chang’e seems like she’s going to announce her relationship! Don’t these announcements normally have a photo of the two together, then a sentence with “we”? You guys advanced way too quick!” Liu Qing exclaimed, then said as if the only thing she fear was the lack of chaos in the world. “Hurry up and appear, Chang’e is very lonely!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen glared at the girl and rolled his eyes, then let out a long sigh…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hahahahaha!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t know what he should say, so he could only type a row of “haha” in the group chat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that he appeared, Chang’e sent a cute emoji followed by a text message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As you guys have thought. Sky Sovereign and I have indeed been linked by a Red String.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: The news is crazy enough!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Gang: Impossible! @Chang’e, I’ve chopped trees in front of your door for so long, do you still not understand my feelings for you?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chang’e: @Wu Gang, you chopping trees in front of my home everyday is super annoying, I can’t even sleep! Stop chopping from now on!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chang’e: Also, I chose to link myself to Sky Sovereign Nameless with a red string.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chang’e: I’m no good at talking with other people. All I want to say is that I hope that you guys can bless us.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chang’e: @Only Idealism, say a few words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Hahahahah…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: Great deity is so happy. That’s natural, able to be with Chang’e is indeed something to be happy about. It’s just a pity that I like Sky Sovereign quite a lot… &lt;insert a row of pitiful emojis&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha: I don’t understand the world of adults, but since Chang’e-jiejie asked as to bless them, then I shall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Congratulations!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mother of Lightning: Congratulations!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The chat group was instantly filled with congratulating messages. At this moment…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Gang: Anyone wants to go and have a drink?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Heavenly Soldier C: Big Brother Gang, count me in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Heavenly Soldier B: As the cold dog good slaps my face, my tears started to flow uncontrollably.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The group was filled with either congratulating messages or complaints. It was only the two extremes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen did not say anything in the group since the private chat messages came way too quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: Bro, I heard Chang’e and you announced your relationship.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: I’ll let you have it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: I’ll stop my thoughts about Chang’e from now on. Bro, I wish you a long and lasting one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: Sky Sovereign, it seems like… I don’t need to hire the fifty cents army anymore, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen truly felt helpless when he saw everyone’s messages.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The speed that it spread was even quicker than the internet.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Taibai Jinxing also sent him a message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing: What do you actually want to do?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing: Did you forget about your identity? How can you date someone from the Heavenly Court?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing: And it had to be Chang’e!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen twitched his mouth and smiled wryly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gramps, do you think I wanted to?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is dating Chang’e such an easy task? That was something that could cause me to become the topics of everyone. </span></i><span style>Just a second after Chang’e announced their relationship and said that she was the one who took the initiative…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Deities continuously sent him friend requests on WeChat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The cursing…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was no worse than flaming on the internet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Never mind, I’m not going to care about you dating Chang’e. How’s the situation with the Underworld?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen licked his lips and replied with a coy smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I haven’t managed to infiltrate in yet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry up and do so. I’m waiting for your good news.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>What Ye Zichen did not expect was that this geezer actually did not swear at him in anger.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That wasn’t like him.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen replied to Taibai Jinxing simply, then quit the chat, and saw that Chang’e had left him a voice message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, may I call you Nameless from now on?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her soft tone was mixed with a hint of shyness and anticipation, causing Ye Zichen to not know whether to laugh or cry.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I’m dating Chang’e.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your intimacy level with Chang’e increased by 300. Current intimacy level: 600.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your intimacy level with Chang’e has leveled up. Current intimacy level: Respect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your affability level with Chang’e increased by 1000. Current affability level: 2015.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You have received Heart-to-Heart Voice Transmitting Sigil x1.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Possessors: Only Idealism, Chang’e!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nameless?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>An inquiring voice rang in Ye Zichen’s mind.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Voice-transmission!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Here!” Ye Zichen replied in his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, such a nice voice,” Chang’e exclaimed like a little girl, then immediately turned embarrassed. “We already publicly announced our relationship, when can you come back to the Heavenly Court…”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What for!?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>For a celebratory feast?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but retort, then replied in his mind, “It’s impossible for me to do so recently. I’m on the verge of breakthrough, so I cannot leave the secret location.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then alright,” Chang’e’s tone held a bit of disappointment that was hard to mask.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Ye Zichen’s mind was in a mess, he replied, “Fairy, I’m going into closed cultivation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm, then go!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only when Chang’e’s voice in his mind disappear did Ye Zichen let out a long sigh, then lay on the bed</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing floated above his head and asked with a look of curiosity, “How is it going with you and Chang’e.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothing special!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just say it, don’t be so petty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Here’s the phone, go and read your doujinshi.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Ye Zichen chucked the phone over. After Liu Qing received the phone, she immediately ran to the side happily and ignored him.</span></p>

The reason it is referred to as such in slang is because single people are often referred to as “single dogs” (单身狗). Most of the time, single people don’t actually want to see that sort of display of affection, which is why the word “stuffed” (塞) is used.<a href="#footnoteref-1" class="btn btn-sm btn-link"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></span></li>
