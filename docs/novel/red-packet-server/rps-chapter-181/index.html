 <p><span style>Chapter 181 – Applying for a Patent</span></p>
 <p><span style>A card game that has swept through the entire world now honorably ascends into the Heavenly Court!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen used an entire hour to explain the rules of Landlord to Erlang Shen with the aids of the words from Baidu and other sources.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Erlang Shen learnt all the rules of the game, he thought for a while…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, this doesn’t seem to be anything that guarantees a profit without loss!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Back then, Ye Zichen had hyped him up quite a bit, and said that it would definitely able to help him turn his situation around. However, after hearing about the rules, the chances of victory seem to be equal for everyone!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It was all down to luck!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, recently, his luck was terrible to no end…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“About this…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen calmed down a bit. It seems like Erlang Shen was right, it truly wasn’t something that was all gain and no losses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You just don’t get it. I’ll teach you first, so it means that you’ll learn it quicker than anyone else. You can win before they completely learn it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s true.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen touched his head, then looked towards the Canopy Marshal and Yue Lao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Landlord was mainly played with three people.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Since there were three here, why doesn’t he try it out on them?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen suddenly noticed a problem after teaching Erlang Shen Landlord…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t get anything out of it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Back then, he had wanted to use Landlord and mahjong to gain some benefits.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen frowned, and started to think how he could gain something from it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Would you like to apply for a patent for Landlord? Patency application requires 100000 cultivation experience.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Such a message suddenly popped up on the screen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes. No.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Damn, I can even apply for a patent!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck this…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It was fortunate that he had conducted a few large transactions before, so he had plenty of cultivation experience. Otherwise, he wouldn’t even be able to apply for the patent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He squinted his eyes!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes!</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was definitely a use of applying for a patent. Although a hundred thousand cultivation was quite a lot, it wasn’t like Ye Zichen couldn’t afford it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your patency application for Landlord was successful. You gained Patency Certificate x1.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clicked into the Treasure Chest, and saw a gold piece of paper on the first row of his Treasure Chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Landlord Patency Certificate!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Possessor: Only Idealism.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The possessor of this patent is able to gain ten percent of the revenue when revenue is gained in the Heavenly Court through the game Landlord.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Oh wow.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was just worrying about not getting any benefits, and now this came up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, a hint of confusion surfaced in Ye Zichen’s heart.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the hell was this system?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why did the system always have notifications about the increase of intimacy level, the increase of affability level and all sorts of other things…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could someone be controlling the system?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Or was it because of his phone!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen scratched his face. </span><i><span style>I have gotten into too many weird things recently, so these few extra ones don’t matter…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>After all!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It was good enough to get the benefits!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>On the business street.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fuxi’s and Suiren’s clothing attracted the attention of the crowd. Plenty of bystanders took out their phones to take photos of them, but the two of them didn’t worry about it at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Memories of them will not remain in the minds of these mortals.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fuxi, are you really deciding to leave our old friend here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suiren was still a bit worried.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They, the Rogue Immortals, did have plenty of Complete Sky Immortals…</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, none of them had stepped into the realm of an Immortal King.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They clearly knew that the level of the Immortal King wasn’t one that anyone could step into. Only the Jade Emperor, Great Sacred Emperor Equaling Heaven and Shakyamuni had managed to reach that level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even the Victorious Fighting Buddha was merely half a step into the level of a Immortal King. That by itself was enough to see how difficult it was to break through into the Immortal King level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thousands of years ago, their old friend decided to go through the cycle of reincarnation. Although there were some personal reasons… It was mostly for the vicissitude of the Immortal Region.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the ninth reincarnation, the gamble was to be taken now!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This life of his was extremely important to the Rogue Immortal’s Immortal Region.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes,” Fuxi did not hesitate at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Care speak about the reason?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The reason is simple, he didn’t have our aid in his previous lives. Although there were tons of misfortune and tribulations, there were also ones, who were born in order to help him face the tribulations, block those. Although the ninth reincarnation will be full of danger, I believe that all that is well ends well…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Such a simple reason?” Suiren frowned. There were indeed people who were born in order to face tribulations for him in his previous lives, but it didn’t mean that it will be the same in this life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What else can we do?” Fuxi smiled. “Father, everything has its fate, forcing things won’t help it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I still think that there’s a need to bring him back to the Immortal Region. Although that would offend the monkey, but we, the Immortal Region, are not scared of him! Since that monkey should be leaving soon, let’s hurry back…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It isn’t a matter of being afraid of the Great Sage,” Fuxi smiled. At that very moment, he suddenly stopped and his eyes lit up when he saw the woman in front of him. “Father, there really isn’t a need to worry now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How is it? Is there anything else you don’t understand?” Xiao Yumei looked at Li Shuang, who was beside her, with a giggle. The more she was with the girl, the more she liked her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This girl gained her interest with both her belief and actions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Shuang was the same. It was a happy thing that she was able to meet a boss that had the same thoughts as her, the only thing that annoyed her was…</span></p>
 <p><span style>That this woman was prettier than her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“More or less, if there is anything I don’t understand, then I can ask Mei-jie during work in the future.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s good as well. Then I’ll let you have half a day off. Just directly come here to find me tomorrow,” Xiao Yumei laughed softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Li Shuang suddenly yanked her, “Mei-jie, the man over there seems to be looking at you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei was already used to men looking at her. When she looked up in order to see what that man was like, she was stunned when she saw Fuxi!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Where did this freak come from?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Were they shooting a film?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But this is the business street, it isn’t a media base.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, what made her confused was that Fuxi actually walked towards her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hello!” Fuxi said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei subconsciously looked around…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>No machines!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>They weren’t shooting a film?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Then why was there someone dressed like this?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Hello,” Xiao Yumei nodded towards him with goodwill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A bracelet made from the teeth of wild beasts suddenly appeared in Fuxi’s hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Meeting is fate. Let me give this bone bracelet to you, it might be able to save your life once in the future.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, he directly placed it into Xiao Yumei’s hand, then left after nodding towards her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Buzz…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei felt a bit dizzy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she calm back to her senses, she looked at the bone bracelet in her hands in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Where did it come from?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>No matter how hard she tried to think, she couldn’t recall where it came from.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei subconsciously put the bone bracelet onto her wrist, then lifted her hand and dangled it in front of her.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s kinda pretty.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Mei-jie, then I’ll be returning. I’ll report here on time tomorrow morning,” At that moment, Li Shuang also giggled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei nodded, “Sure, then come here tomorrow and report in.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Fuxi and Suiren walked through the crowd, Suiren turned around and looked at Xiao Yumei, “Why did you give her the bone bracelet! It’s not like you don’t know what that represents!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Father, do you not know who she is?” Fuxi suddenly smiled mysteriously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suiren raised his eyebrows, “How would I know!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She is…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fuxi whispered the name softly, causing Suiren’s expression to completely change after hearing it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that for real!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Definitely!”</span></p>
