 <p><span style>Chapter 267 – Ox-Head Borrows Money</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within a bright and quiet room…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sat on a chair and looked at Gou Yuzhan, who was sitting beside him, with surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My god, if I’m dreaming, then let this dream continue on forever!” Gou Yuzhan muttered inaudible words as he stuffed food into his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen let out a sigh, then ignored Gou Yuzhan and smiled towards Sun Yige with his wine glass raised, “Class Rep Sun…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, oh,” Sun Yige raised her glass and touched it with Ye Zichen’s, then turned her gaze back to Gou Yuzhan. “He is truly eating very happily!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“God only knows what sort of experience caused him to be like this!” Ye Zichen shrugged helplessly with a smile, then started to pick up the food on his plate with his chopsticks, which Class Rep Sun had cooked personally…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How is it, is it delicious?” Sun Yige bit her lip and looked closely at Ye Zichen’s expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zeze, Class Rep Sun, your cooking skills really aren’t bad!” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows, then couldn’t help but pick up more food.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s good that you like it,” Sun Yige smiled softly in response.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a good half an hour passed, Ye Zichen patted his tummy as he leaned back on the chair and burped in satisfaction. Meanwhile, Gou Yuzhan had pretty much finished as well…</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he wasn’t because it was full, it was because there wasn’t anything edible left on the table!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you for the feast. I’m pretty much finished, so I’ll leave now!” Gou Yuzhan rubbed his hands and stood up from the chair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen glanced at him and yanked his arm, “Where are you going!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn’t I already say it before coming here? I’m definitely not going to be the third wheel!” Gou Yuzhan shrugged. “There’s nothing else to eat, so I’ll leave now and give the two of you some space!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Gou Yuzhan irresponsibly left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He only came to freeload!” Ye Zichen was speechless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t he your friend?” Sun Yige blinked. “But your friend is pretty amazing, there was so much food…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Would you believe me if I told you that I don’t know him?" Ye Zichen rolled his eyes in annoyance. “My story with him originated from a lollipop…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A lollipop?” Sun Yige was confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, Ye Zichen told her about the things that happened between him and Gou Yuzhan with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a while, Sun Yige snickered, “He’s kinda cute!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really?” Ye Zichen truly didn’t get where the cute point was, causing him to look at her in surprise…</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment, Sun Yige also looked up and saw Ye Zichen’s dark eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sun Yige’s face randomly blushed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received a marriage string.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen took out his phone and looked at the Treasure Chest in shock…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Possessor: Ye Zichen, Possessed: Sun Yige. Current affability level: 10.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the hell? How did I get linked with School Beauty Sun?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>For some reason, the more Sun Yige, who held her head with her hands as she looked at Ye Zichen, looked at him, the more she wanted to continue doing so. It was as if she had completely fell, and was unable to pull herself out of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After long time, she finally bit her lips and smiled, “There’s been way too many things to thank you for recently…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’re classmates, so no need to be so courteous,” Ye Zichen smiled slightly forcefully. At that moment, he truly was a bit nervous…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He hadn’t gain any marriage strings for a long time, and now, he freaking linked with the class rep.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Fortunately, the affability level wasn’t particularly high. It was merely 10.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at the time, then smiled, “It’s getting late, I have to go!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll send you off!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sun Yige stood up from the chair and sent Ye Zichen to the entrance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just here is fine, hurry back!” Ye Zichen stopped at a place about several tens of meters away from Sun Yige’s family’s Chinese restaurant and smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, see you tomorrow!” Sun Yige nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“See you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen waved towards Sun Yige then sped off in the car. Even after the car completely disappeared from her sights, Sun Yige continued to gaze at where he left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, a person wearing a long black robe that covered their face in a hood walked out from the shadows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sun Yige!” The person had a woman’s voice that sounded almost identical to Sun Yige’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are you…” Sun Yige bit her lips and wanted to run away, but her body was restrained, causing her to be unable to move at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You tell me who I am!” With that, the black robed woman dropped her hood, revealing a face identical to Sun Yige’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You… You…” Sun Yige was so stunned that she didn’t know what to say.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the woman smiled, and caressed Sun Yige’s cheeks, “Now you know who I am? Actually, I’m you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen returned to the school dormitory, he saw that no one was there, exactly as he expected.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He laid on the bed lazily and took out his phone. There weren’t any huge matters in the Heavenly Court’s chat group, since they were discussing about the establishment of the school and the regulations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, the Underworld’s group was busier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ox-Head: @Hua Tuo, Elder Hua, don’t be so stingy, just lend me a little.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Horse-Face: Big Brother Ox-Head is right!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hua Tuo: This old man doesn’t have much either. I’ve been losing recently as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ox-Head: Then what should I do? It’s almost the repayment date for the Heaven and Earth bank. I still lack twenty something thousand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hua Tuo: How about borrowing from other people?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ox Head: We ghost servants don’t get as good of a treatment as you mortals who chose to remain in the Underworld get. They might not be able to lend me merits!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Merits?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Heaven and Earth merits?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen blanked out for a moment, then sent Ox-Head a friend request.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I have accepted your friend request. Let’s chat!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ox-Head: Bro, what’s up!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He’s so easy to talk to.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ox-Head and Horse-Face were ghost marshals of the underworld, and even some temples in the Modern World had statues of them.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I never would have expected him to be so friendly with a little ghost servant like me.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Ox-Head, this little ghost just saw that Big Brother Ox-Head seemed to want to borrow Heaven and Earth merits? You are one of the Underworld’s ghost marshals, how did you end up like this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha, I can tell that you’re new!” Ox-Head sighed. “We Ox-Head and Horse-Face used to have a similar position to the Black and White Impermanences, and were soul-reaping servants that had actual power before. However, the Heavenly Court and the Underworld’s relationship soured, since Little Brother Horse-Face and I had closer ties to the Heavenly Court guys… So… Ai, never mind, there’s no point of looking back on things.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen suddenly understood. </span><i><span style>I didn’t think that there was such a situation.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It seems like the tensions between the Heavenly Court and the Underworld were misfortune to a bunch of people. A good example was Ox-Head, no matter what, he’s a ghost marshal… He actually reached the point of needing to borrow Heaven and Earth merits from others.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But this is good. I don’t have a particularly high reputation in the Underworld, so I’ll take the chance of Ox-Head being down to get to know him. This might be of great help for me in the future.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Then Big Brother Ox-Head, how much Heaven and Earth merits do you need? I’ll lend it to you!”</span></p>
