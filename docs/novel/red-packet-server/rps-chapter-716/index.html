 <p><span style>Chapter 716 – Consecutive Breakthroughs</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the loud dragon roar sounded through the Three Realms, the faint figure of a gold dragon coiled in the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment the image appeared, spiritual energy seemed to radiate out from its body and spread out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ley line is the crux of the Three Realms. It’s appearance instantly caused the density of spiritual energy in the Three Realms to go up a notch. Of course, the area that benefited the most was naturally Maple City, which was closest to the ley line.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian, who was eating a pork knuckle in brown sauce, put his food down. Since he was enjoying good food, he naturally was not cultivating, but he could feel the spiritual energy in his body increase.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Breakthrough.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In merely a few breaths’ worths of time, he, who had only just broken through to the late-stage of the Sky Immortal level, broke through to the complete stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, that was only the beginning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>More and more Heavenly Soldiers begun to break through, causing gold glows of breakthroughs all around the city.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although it seemed unbelievable, some Heavenly Soldiers decided to take the chance to sit down cross-legged on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They began to mutter the incantations of their cultivation technique and either solidified their cultivation level or tried to continue breaking through to the level they want to be at.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nezha,” Yang Jian looked to the side and noticed that Nezha was still eating. He smacked the pork knuckle out of Nezha’s hands with a frown. “Eat. Eat. Eat. That’s all you ever do. Don’t you feel something strange?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Strange?” Nezha looked at Yang Jian in confusion, then burped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He broke through.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Into the complete stage of the Sky Immortal level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh? What’s going on? How did I break through?” Nezha licked his fingers and smiled so hard that his eyes turned into two lines. “Haha, now father can’t beat me. Let’s see how he’s going to beat me when I eat snacks at home.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you always thinking about eating?” Yang Jian rolled his eyes. “Why aren’t you considering why so many of us broke through?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A lot of people broke through?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nezha looked around, then noticed that occasional gold sparks would light up in the city.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, why are so many people breaking through!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m the one asking you!” Yang Jian was extremely frustrated. Although he didn’t want to admit it, he knew that he wasn’t the brightest person. He really couldn’t find a possible explanation for all this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They probably found the ley line. But who cares, I’m so hungry after the fight just now,” Nezha rubbed his tummy, then noticed that Gou Yuzhan, who was sitting with them, didn’t even look up at all. He was still eating.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, leave some for me!” With that, Nezha begun to stuff things into his mouth, and would occasionally glance at Gou Yuzhan as if the two were in some sort of eating competition.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ley line?” Yang Jian could only shake his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although he is the Heavenly Court’s war god and held a very high celestial position, he still wasn’t one of the older deities, so he doesn’t know the value and the effects of the leyline.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Never mind.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since he knew he couldn’t figure it out, he really didn’t want to bother anymore.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I might as well use my time to eat. </span></i><span style>However, just as he turned back to the table, he noticed that the entire table of food was replaced with mere bones.</span></p>
 <p><span style>”Are you two pigs!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon, who was guarded by Ye Zichen and Lorie, had a dark look on his face. He squinted his eyes and looked at the two people, then chose to use Ye Zichen as his breakthrough point.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zeze, so you want to treat me as your breakthrough point,” Ye Zichen naturally felt that invading gaze. He shrugged, then hook his index finger at Black Dragon. “Bring it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon was naturally not foolish enough to charge forward when his opponent said so. He was in a two versus one situation, and although the girl behind him seemed to be smiling harmlessly, he felt a sense of pressure from him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, her physical strength seemed to be at least equal to a matured Abyssal!</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, a gold dragon’s roar sounded out in the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon, who was pondering what he should do next, felt more and more anxious.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I can’t waste any more time with them here.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He gritted his teeth, then suddenly kneeled down on one knee.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s going on?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was dumbstruck.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is he submitting?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, don’t…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before Ye Zichen could finish, Black Dragon said seriously, “Welcome, o esteemed messenger.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Messenger.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen felt a chill down his spine. He instantly protected his guts, then subconsciously summoned both the Swirling Flash Plate and created an armor of blood energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked around nervously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon revealed a sinister smile, then pushed his palm against Ye Zichen’s back with all the spiritual energy he has been gathering.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Nobody’s here!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Shit, he tricked me!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen saw nobody in the surroundings, he immediately realized that Black Dragon was merely calling his bluff.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, be careful!” Lorie shouted. However, it was already too late.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fortunately, Black Dragon’s attack did not pierce through his body due to the two protective armors, but the residue spiritual energy seemed to tear at the interior of his body, causing him to cough up a mouthful of blood.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I was too careless!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Liu Qing’s dealing with the messenger already, so how could he come over here!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He had fallen for the trick because of the pressure he felt from the demon messenger who was half-a-step into the Diviner level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon immediately took advantage of the situation. He formed claws with his hands, while black scales surfaced on his face and arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Screw off!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lorie kicked Black Dragon on the back. Ye Zichen quickly rolled to the side and reached out with his right hand, “Xuan-Yuan!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xuan-Yuan Sword came out of his arm. He reached out and grabbed its hilt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Winds soared, sweeping up the sand and rocks in the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That was your only chance just now,” Ye Zichen smirked. “I have to say, you really know how to make use of an opportunity. But you’re still going to remain here forever.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Swordslash Maelstrom!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Several hundred blades of air formed in the gather and shot towards Black Dragon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon grunted. The pain on his body caused his eyes to swell up with blood. When he felt the blades of wind disappear, he looked up…</span></p>
 <p><span style>And saw another wind blade several meters tall with terrifying sharpness locked onto him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I’m in danger!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon could feel his heart race in danger, but it felt like he wasn’t going to be able to muster up any real defense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a feeling he only felt from the white-robed man. </span><i><span style>Impossible, how could Ye Zichen possess this level of strength!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He roared maniacally in his mind. However, Ye Zichen didn’t care.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This ends now. Die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, the blade of wind slashed down at Black Dragon’s scaly body.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;">[expand]<strong>Teaser:</strong>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p><b>Black Dragon:&nbsp;</b>Are you a fool? The two of you are...</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>What? We have lower cultivation levels than you? We have lower power levels than you? Didn't you know that power level can be hidden!?</p>
 <p><strong>Black Dragon:&nbsp;</strong>Keep bluffing Ye Zichen. I will tear you limb from limb...</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>I've heard this before. You're going to skin me as well, right? What's next? Feed me my tongue? Or are you feeding them to the dogs? Oh yeah, quarter me as well, right? Or maybe flay me first?</p>
 <p><strong>Black Dragon:&nbsp;</strong>Your ignorance will be your undoing!</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Well, I'm sorry to tell you, but... YOU ARE NOT PREPARED!</p>
