 <p><span style>“Huang Jia!” The girl in blue smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded, then glanced at the girl in purple, “She…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jiang Xiaoyue!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded with a faint smile, then started to chitchat with the girl in blue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Doing so, he learnt that both girls were Year Four students in the Media University nearby.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They both majored in radio hosting!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>No wonder they invoked such affinity when speaking, while their words also easily made people fall for them.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pursed his lips and smiled, then stood up from the sofa. Huang Jia followed him as he walked towards Mu Chuang and the other girl.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fact that he could chat with the girl of his dreams made Mu Chuang blush excitedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mr. Ye,” Jiang Xiaoyue smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded, then smiled at Mu Chuang, “Do you like her?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chuang blushed without speaking. Ye Zichen squinted his eyes and scanned the two girls.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you like, I can get her to go to your room tonight to be with you. If you feel like she’s not enough, then she…” Ye Zichen pointed to Huang Jia. “Can as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen-ge!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen merely smiled meaningfully in response, “Just tell me whether you like her or not. If you do…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mr. Ye I think you made a mistake. We merely accompany you for chats and do not provide any extra service,” Jiang Xiaoyue frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen merely smiled meaningfully, “Do you think you have a choice?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, he leaned back on the sofa and looked towards the two girls with an appraising gaze, “Professional chatting accompanier costing thirty thousand per hour. Needless to say, you know how to chat very well, and you are indeed worthy of this price in the eyes of rich people. Your clubhouse may actually have regulations, perhaps… you don’t provide other services. But, do you think the clubhouse would help you out if I wanted to take you two away?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two girls remained silent, since what Ye Zichen said was the truth.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He straightforwardly asked for a diamond card worth ten million, which was shocking even for the costly prices here.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>If someone of his status really wanted to take us away, we can’t resist at all.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Dong dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the room door was pushed open, and the clubhouse supervisor walked in from the outside with a coy smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mr. Ye, a VIP came and specifically asked for Jiang Xiaoyue…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows. </span><i><span style>I’m teaching my little brother a lesson here, and this supervisor is coming to shit on my face?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“VIP? You have to go in order, right? I already chose these two girls, yet someone else can just take them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mr. Ye, I’m very sorry. The clubhouse will give you a twenty percent discount on all your consumptions today,” The supervisor nodded respectfully with a coy smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sneered, “Do you think I lack the money? I’m don’t care who comes and asks. GET OUT!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Such arrogance,” A playful laughter sounded out at the door. Not long later, a bright-looking young man walked in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Han, help me talk to him. He wants to take me away!” Jiang Xiaoyue revealed a worried look and grasped at straws.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man was briefly stunned before curling the corner of his lips, “Sir, you can’t not know the rules of this humble one’s clubhouse, right? No additional services are provided here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, he clapped his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, a group of security guards appeared at the entrance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir, you might not be too familiar with our rules since you’re a new member. If you just leave the issue, then I can give you a fifty percent off. If you are determined to take our clubhouse’s girls away, then I don’t mind teaching you a lesson about our rules.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re Han Yu?” Ye Zichen, who sat on the sofa, took out a cigarette from his pocket, which he then lit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are?” The young man paused upon hearing that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I knew it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had thought that he sounded slightly familiar when the young man entered the room, and with the way Jiang Xiaoyue addressed him just now…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just like I expected.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“How is your little brother’s finger?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yu’s face immediately froze when he heard that. Then, he smiled meaningfully, “Ye Zichen!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems like Han Qi mentioned me to you?” Ye Zichen smiled. “That brat truly isn’t that bad, so I taught him a lesson in your place. That isn’t too much, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Indeed! I wanted to teach my little brother a lesson ages ago, I can’t even thank Young Master Ye enough for doing that,” Han Yu smiled brightly. Then his expression darkened. “Though Young Master Ye’s teaching methods seem a bit too much…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s alright, at least he’s still alive, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everybody’s heart jumped when they heard those words. Nobody expected that this diamond member actually had this sort of link to their boss.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And from the meaning behind the last sentence…</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had a grudge!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe… Then I have to thank Young Master Ye,” Han Yu half-squinted, then smiled. “Young Master Ye came to this humble one’s clubhouse so suddenly, could it be to…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t think too much into it, I just brought my little brother here to have a look. He kept on saying that he wanted to chat with the girl in purple. If I knew this was Young Master Han’s clubhouse, I wouldn’t dare to come, no matter what!” Ye Zichen smiled faintly, but no hint of fear could be seen in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Ye…” Han Yu chuckled, then patted the supervisor’s shoulders. “Waive all of Young Master Ye’s charges here. From now on, whenever Young Master Ye comes to our clubhouse, treat him as a VIP of the highest level.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood, boss!” The supervisor continuously nodded in response.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I wish Young Master Ye a good time here. I’ll stop bothering you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then why are you still standing here? Leave. You’re wasting my time,” Ye Zichen sneered mercilessly. “Oh yeah, I want to take these two girls away, is that alright?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please!” Han Yu made a “please” gesture, then left the room with the supervisor.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I didn’t think that Han Yu would have that much tolerance. This makes him hard to deal with, but I need to deal with this first.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The faces of Jiang Xiaoyue and Huang Jia turned stark white after seeing their final hope get crushed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Ye Zichen also laughed, “Do you see that? You two have no way of resisting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, he turned towards Mu Chuang with a smile, “What do you think? As long as you want, the two of them are yours tonight. If you want, they can even be yours forever!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I just want to ask one thing,” Mu Chuang, who had stayed silent until now, looked up and straight at Jiang Xiaoyue. “All of the stuff you said to me just now was purely part of your job, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you tell him the truth, your futures might have a chance,” Ye Zichen spoke up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!” Jiang Xiaoyue bit her lips. “The reason I chatted with you was purely because you guys paid…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Does that mean that it was all due to Zichen-ge’s face?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!” Jiang Xiaoyue clenched her fists tightly and nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Mu Chuang looked up at her with bright eyes and smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve decided!”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Original Chapter Teaser:</b>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Dear Diary,</p>
 <p>Today, Zichen-ge took me over to the clubhouse to see the girl of my dreams. Man, Zichen-ge was so freaking awesome! Even when I was there with Li En, I have never saw them treat us this way. He even stuffed money into a girl's cleavage like I see in those western movies! That's something I've always dreamed of doing, since it's just so freaking cool. I mean, c'mon, I'm sure any normal guys would want to do just that!</p>
 <p>Also, the way the girl reacted was surprising as well. Usually, people would just get slapped in the face and thrown out, since apparently the owner of the clubhouse was some big shot that people can't mess with. But that's not what happened with us. Instead, the girl just smile and even flirted with Zichen-ge!</p>
 <p>I suppose it has to do with looks as well. I think the guy who tried it before was some fat middle-aged guy, while Zichen-ge is a good looking guy around the girl's age, it's natural for the girls to react like this, since a lot of girls do dream of living a princess's life with their very own tall, rich and handsome Prince Charming.</p>
 <p>That's why, I've decided. I'm going to work under Zichen-ge and learn from him. I've got decent enough looks, so all I need now is money. I'm going to learn how Zichen-ge got so rich so that I can get rich and powerful in a few years time like he is rich now!</p>
