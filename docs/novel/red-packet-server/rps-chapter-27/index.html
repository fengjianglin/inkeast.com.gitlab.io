 <p><span style>Chapter 27 – Erlang Shen the Shameless</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandson, why did you @grandpa so anxiously? Do you need pocket money?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Ye Zichen did not appear for so long, the deities thought that the flame war would not begin, and had prepared to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, once this message was sent, people were instantly shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Little bastard, you finally came. Quickly announce your celestial title.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The hell was a celestial title, how could Ye Zichen have one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He twitched his mouth and directly sent three contempt emojis.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The heck use is announcing my celestial title, the stronger person is the boss. State your coordinates, let’s meet face to face.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Ye Zichen said that, all of the deities watching were shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They thought to themselves, that deity is too amazing, he actually dares to fight face to face with Erlang Shen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen clearly was stunned as well. He had been famous in the heavenly realm for a long time. Aside from the monkey that dared to fight with him, everyone else would avoid him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This brat actually dared to meet him face to face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, then we’ll meet face to face.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wasn’t a war god for nothing. If Erlang Shen was scared of fighting face to face, his reputation would be all gone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen directly sent the map over. The entire crowd was shocked by the map.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t get it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve never seen this, where is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen was also one of the ones that was confused. What are these intersecting lines? He didn’t get it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you just send?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s laozi’s address. Come, it’s Bingcheng Polytechnic University.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How do you get there?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk, this is a secret location. This sovereign only entered through a series of events. You’re asking how I got in here? How would this sovereign know?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…” Erlang Shen stayed silent for a moment, then instantly blew up. “You’re messing with me, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Messing with you? You don’t deserved to get messed with by me. I told you the location already, come if you can, if you can’t then scuttle off to the side to feed your dog.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re pissing me off, pissing me off…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A flame war begun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the number one flamer in the heavenly realm, he had never lost a single flame war.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within a split second, Erlang Shen used his insane typing speed, filling the entire screen with his messages. Seeing that, Ye Zichen smiled in disdain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He casually sent an internet phrase over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Ye Zichen did not have the advantage in quantity, every single thing he said was completely on point.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You little bastard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re a dog-feeder in the Heavenly Court.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t get cocky with me, I’ll beat the crap out of you if I meet you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re a dog-feeder in the Heavenly Court.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re pretending to be an idiot now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re a dog-feeder in the Heavenly Court.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your little sister got bedded by a mortal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your older sister also got bedded by a mortal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Chang’e doesn’t love you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chang’e: What does this have to do with me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the start, Erlang Shen would say ten-odd things before rebutted by Ye Zichen’s one, to him getting rebutted once every time he says something, until the end where Erlang Shen ended up not knowing what to say at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had achieved a complete victory in this flame war.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandson, if you want to fight, then go according to the address. As for flaming… You’re not good enough.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sent the message over with a cold smile and three contempt emojis.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen has sent a friend request.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Accept.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandson, you got business?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was still submerged in his pride of his recent victory.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This celestial friend, I feel like we have a bond. How about we become sworn brothers?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the hell?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Sworn brothers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at the intimacy level behind Erlang Shen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>100.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Friendly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This retard is just a shameless piece of crap, he actually got happy from being cursed. Then came his reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen directly refused, but Erlang Shen sent another message over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother, we didn’t get to know each other until we flamed. This god has never been matched in the flame circle in the heavenly realm. They say that a master is lonely. It’s true, I am too empty inside. Every time I cause a flame war, it’s to find someone that can defeat me. Today, you finally appeared…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, I sincerely want to become sworn brothers with you. You should know as well. In the Heavenly Court, I am this!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen added a thumb emoji at the end of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Number One.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then what rank did he put the Jade Emperor at?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen thought about it, it doesn’t seem too bad to become sworn brothers with Erlang Shen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To be honest, he truly was too impulsive when he flamed Erlang Shen in the group chat. If any deity pointed out that they have never seen him, or Erlang Shen was determined to make him say his celestial title, then he would be found out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he becomes sworn brothers with Erlang Shen, even if he gets found out, he will just @Erlang Shen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen definitely can tear the person that pointed it out to shred with his insults.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen wishes to become your sworn brother.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Accept.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your intimacy level with Erlang Shen increased by 100. Current intimacy level is Trusted, it is 400 away from Respected.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t think that becoming sworn brothers would increase the intimacy level by 100, this is the first Trusted that he had achieved in the deities’ chat group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, I wonder how I should call you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This sovereign’s dharma name is Nameless. You can call me Brother Nameless.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Nameless.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Erlang Shen addressed him intimately, Ye Zichen also felt the magic of Trusted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now, even if the Jade Emperor told Erlang Shen that Ye Zichen wasn’t a deity and he was going to kick Ye Zichen out of the group. This idiot would surely flame the Jade Emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Nameless, add our family’s Howling Celestial Dog as your friend. If you can’t find me here, it’s the same if you send a message to him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Howling Celestial Dog has sent a friend request.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Accept.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Howling Celestial Dog: Woof, woof, woof…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damn!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It truly was a dog.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His phone suddenly rang. When Ye Zichen took a look, he saw that Erlang Shen had actually sent him a red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That Erlang Shen is rather respectful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled and clicked on the red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received Erlang Shen’s red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unbreakable Body x1</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unbreakable Body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This seems to be the Great Sage’s ability.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I wasn’t sure of what to give to Brother Nameless. This is a secret scripture that I sent the Howling Celestial Dog to steal from the monkey a while ago. I’ll give it to Brother Nameless.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That Howling Celestial Dog is quite capable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It could actually steal the scripture from the monkey bro. It seemed like it had always been the monkey bro stealing from other people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, to be honest, Ye Zichen was rather interested in that Seventy-Two Transformations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, this Unbreakable Body is the ability of the Monkey King, I can barely use it. I wonder if you can do something about the Seventy-Two Transformations…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Nameless, it’s not that I’m petty, the main reason is because this Seventy-Two Transformation is too special…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, then never mind.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since he couldn’t get it, Ye Zichen wasn’t going to force it. It was good enough for him to get the Unbreakable Body. Thinking about it, this guy already sent him a secret scripture… He looked around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A book fell into his sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Scan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen received your red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have a read, it’s definitely useful for you. Do you know why you can’t defeat me in a flame war? It’s all thanks to this book.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I’ll have to be sure and read it properly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your intimacy level with Erlang Shen increased by 50. Current intimacy level is 250, it is 350 away from Respected.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ugh.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>This amount…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled helplessly, then opened the Treasure Chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unbreakable Body!</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he learned this secret scripture, wouldn’t he be impenetrable?</span></p>
