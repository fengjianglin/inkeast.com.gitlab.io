 <p><span style>Chapter 105 – Officer Lin treats him to meal</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did you drink so much?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Xiao Yumei smelled the alcohol on Ye Zichen, she specifically brewed a pot of tea for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who was leaning back on the sofa, moved his neck, “My friends just got discharged from the hospital, so we celebrated together.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he replied, he noticed the pile of files on Xiao Yumei’s work table, causing him to raise his eyebrows, “Are you busy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, isn’t Bai Dahai’s jewelry shop under your name now? You didn’t look at any of the accounts and are fine with being a free owner, so could I not manage it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen grabbed her hands and smiled when he felt the annoyance in Xiao Yumei’s tone, “You’ve worked hard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You know that I worked hard?” Xiao Yumei rolled her eyes at Ye Zichen, then sat down beside him with a frown. “When I was going through Bai Dahai’s accounts then, I kept on feeling something amiss, but I don’t know what’s wrong with it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That didn’t surprise Ye Zichen at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ignore it. Bai Dahai definitely has some sort of trap for us. Let’s just wait for him to reveal himself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You sure?” Xiao Yumei said worriedly. “Finance is not a small issue. If he was allowed to do anything he wants, then the future will be troublesome.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that so?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen didn’t understand business at all, so he thought about it and called Xiao Hai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Ye, how did you get time to call Hai-ge? Say it, what’s is it now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The clear laughter from the other side of the phone caused Ye Zichen to blush. He felt a bit embarrassed that he would go and find Xiao Hai whenever there is trouble.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hai-ge, I did have something I wanted to trouble you with.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go on.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I acquired fifty one percent of the shares of Bai Dahai’s jewelry store, but I feel like he set a trap for me, so I want Hai-ge to help me investigate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bai Dahai? Sure, just leave it to me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I’ll be trouble Hai-ge.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No worries.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen hung up and gaze Xiao Yumei a reassuring look, “It’s done. If it’s Hai-ge, then he can definitely find something.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little fellow, you know quite a bit of people,” Xiao Yumei smiled</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen instantly smiled naughtily, “Am I little?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you not little?” Xiao Yumei also replied playfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, it seems like you are starting to forget after not seeing it for so long. I have to help you remember,” With that, Ye Zichen picked up Xiao Yumei and put her onto the office table as she exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t, this is the company.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So what? It’s exciting because it’s at the company. What’s more, would they dare to enter without your assent?” Ye Zichen smiled, then kissed her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he left Xiao Yumei’s company, it was already night time. Since Xiao Hai was investigating Bai Dahai’s side, there was nothing to worry about.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen started to get mesmerized as he walked on the sidewalk and looked at the scenery.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the phone in his pocket rang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hello?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen? I’m Lin Xiyue.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen and Lin Xiyue sat in a small room in a north-eastern restaurant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Officer Lin, there seems to be something wrong with you,” Ye Zichen glanced over Officer Lin’s body as he leaned back on the chair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Officer Lin wore a white T-shirt a pair of blue jeans as well as a silver necklace around her neck, while her long hair flowed down to her shoulders. She had even put on a faint bit of makeup.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the first time he saw Officer Lin like this ever since they got to know each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do I look bad?” Lin Xiyue bit her lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shook his head and praised her, “You look good, but I just find it weird.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s weird?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Our relationship seems…” Ye Zichen did not finish his sentence, and instead nodded. “I just feel like it’s too weird that you are treating me to a meal and wore something like this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Xiyue rolled her eyes at Ye Zichen, “Don’t think too much into it, I’m treating you to a meal purely because I want to thank you for saving me that day.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I definitely won’t think too much, but you just chose this sort of place to repay me for saving your life?” Ye Zichen twitched his mouth. This girl was too stingy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How much can I civil servant like me have?” Lin Xiyue bit her lips in a troubled manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at her…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What sort of look is that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What exactly do you want to say!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can you speak or not!” Lin Xiyue slammed down on the table, causing all the other customers in the shop to look towards her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She blushed, then complained as she bit her lips, “Can you speak? What’s this supposed to mean?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Speechlessness. Don’t you get it?” Ye Zichen looked at her helplessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That caused Lin Xiyue to immediately get angry, “Why are you speechless?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, I admit, treating you, a young master, to a place like this is a bit too low.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s not just a bit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fine, the place I chose is too low-classed,” Lin Xiyue clenched her teeth and snorted. “But I did save you once, if I didn’t get there in time…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you hehe’ing for!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Xiyue was about to go mad from Ye Zichen’s torture. Why did she not notice that he was actually someone like that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen picked up a piece of red-cooked pork with his chopsticks and glanced at Lin Xiyue, who was on the verge of going insane.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“First of all, you didn’t hurry there in time. Commissioner told you to go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s more, if it wasn’t for your boyfriend, do you think I would have ended up like that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, Lin Xiyue was speechless, because she couldn’t argue against any of Ye Zichen’s words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Especially since Zhao Ziming told Liu Qiang to make a move on him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry,” Lin Xiyue buried her head with an apologetic look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sighed silently when he heard the sad tone, “Enough, don’t apologize. Getting such a petty boyfriend isn’t your fault. If you’re going to blame, then blame the sins you’ve committed in your previous life.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I really want to hit you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen instantly laughed when he heard that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are plenty of people that wants to hit me, just who the heck are you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two of them finished the meal in chatter, then left the restaurant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they stood outside, Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows, “Officer Lin, any other orders?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Screw off, hurry up and screw off.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Xiyue was enraged by Ye Zichen throughout the entire meal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled when he saw her annoyed look and blinked, “Then bye bye. You’d better not dream of me when you go back tonight, otherwise, you’ll fall in love with me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Screw off!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the looks of it, if he didn’t run, then he would get beaten.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen quickly shrunk his neck and ran.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen’s figure disappeared from sight…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Puchi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Xiyue, whose face was covered in rage, suddenly laughed!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The laugh was as extravagant as fireworks.</span></p>
