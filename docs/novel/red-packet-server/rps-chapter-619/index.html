 <p><span style>Chapter 619 – Red Packet</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before Ye Zichen could even express his joy, the others in the group actually expressed an excitement that seemed to surpass even his.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In fact, the group instantly exploded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: Congratulations big brother, you got a promotion!</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Congratz, congratz!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: Congratulations to our supervisor for getting a promotion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: Sky Sovereign, shouldn’t you show us some… you know.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Fortune: Yes, yes, yes. That’s right. The entire Heavenly Court is under Sky Sovereign’s command now. Wait a moment, Canopy Marshal, that was too much. He’s our supervisor, and you actually wanted to get something from him?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Barefoot Immortal: This is good news.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Profound Lady of the Nine Heavens: The future of the Heavenly Court is counting on you all. &nbsp;Chancellor Sky Sovereign already has his token, so please cooperate with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: Beauty, let’s go out?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Profound Lady of the Nine Heavens: Screw off!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: Hehe, Canopy Marshal is so embarrassed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: Gah, you little girl, you actually dared to tease me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: Why don’t I, my older brother is your boss.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Zeze, we don’t dare to screw Sky Sovereign over, but little Immortality Peach Fairy, shouldn’t you give us something now that your big brother got promoted?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: What? I’m just a little fairy, what do I have that can make you great deities interested?</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Fortune: Don’t you still have Peaches of Immortality?</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Yeah.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: But…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Barefoot Immortal: Your brother is already the head of the Heavenly Court, so what are you afraid of? Send it, send it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the deities in the group started agreeing with that. Immortality Peach Fairy thought about it. </span><i><span style>Yeah, my brother is the head now, so why should I be worried?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Ye Zichen didn’t say anything in the group, he had been paying close attention to it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He immediately tapped the moment the red packet popped up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received Immortality Peach Fairy’s red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fifty-year-old Peach of Immortality x1.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ever since the Great Sage stole another ground of peaches from the Immortality Peach Garden, the ones remaining were only the youngest and worst ones.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: Ten-year-old one…</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Fortune: A twenty-year-old one…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: Don’t blame it on me. Great Sage has been visiting rather frequently. These are all younger ones.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: I just took a look, Sky Sovereign got a red packet too.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I guess I can’t lurk anymore. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, Ye Zichen could only speak up with a chuckle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You guys actually noticed. Ahem, I’m the Chancellor of the Grand Secretariat now, so I’ll rely on you all to cooperate with me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: Definitely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Sky Sovereign’s command dictates where I shall move in the future.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Holy crap, it seems like I missed a lot. Little immortality peach girl even sent red packets. What’s going on?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: Sky Sovereign got promoted and became the head of the Heavenly Court. We all have to listen to him now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen : Oh my god.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A red packet suddenly appeared on the screen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Ye Zichen was typing when it appeared, he didn’t pay too much attention to it. When he reached out to tap on it, it was already too late.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen could only feel a bit of regret when he saw he had missed his chance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Fortune: Seriously, did the sun rise up from the west? Old Yang actually sent a red packet!</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Take a look at what he sent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: It’s just a bit of symbolism. If you’re so amazing, then </span><i><span style>you </span></i><span style>send some red packets. Cheapskate, you actually commented on me?</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: You’re joking right? Fine, I’ll send it. It’s just a red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, Ye Zichen was not typing, so he immediately tapped on the red packet when it appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received God of Thunder’s red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mystic Art of Thunder Control x1.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Golden Boy: Uncle Thunder, something wrong with your head?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jade Girl: Mamma mia!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nobody expected God of Thunder’s red packet to cause both Golden Boy and Jade Girl to exclaim. Not only that, everybody in the group immediately spammed the chat and said that God of Thunder was extremely generous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clicked open the red packet to see what other people got.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Extraterrestrial Thunder Stone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rootless Sacred Fruit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nine Leaved Divine Clover.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every single item shown were things that Ye Zichen felt were extremely high class. </span><i><span style>Is this seriously the God of Thunder I know?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is this that God of Thunder who refuses to spend even a single bit of cultivation experience?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: F*ck, hurry up and return everything to me. I sent the wrong stuff.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ugh.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>No wonder.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone all mocked him, while God of Thunder continued to cry about getting the treasures back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye ZIchen naturally quit the chat group. </span><i><span style>Mystic Art of Thunder Control…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>That’s a treasure which would cost several million cultivation experience in the shop.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Mystic Art of Thunder Control: A mystic art to control thunder and lightning. It is able to summon the Profound Lightning of the Nine Heavens.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bwahahaha.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but gasp when he saw the description. </span><i><span style>This is definitely a top class secret scripture.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I’ll learn it!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The system has detected that you would like to learn the Mystic Art of Thunder Control. This secret scripture will disappear after use. Would you like to proceed?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Usage failed. You do not possess the mutated Thunder attribute, so you are unable to use this secret scripture. It has been returned to your Treasure Chest.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>You’re shitting me.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at the notification in shock. </span><i><span style>It’s definitely shitting me.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I actually can’t use such a top class secret scripture?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: Just what are you thinking? Don’t you know what your constitution is like? You actually want to learn Leizhenzi’s mystic art? The only thing you can learn are those supportive spiritual techniques that doesn’t require any particular attribute. Oh yeah, congratulations on your advance to power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whatever,” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes with a snort. “How is it? You happy now? I finally got the position of the chief of the Heavenly Court.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: Don’t talk to me like that. Are you going to tell me that it was useless?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha,” Ye Zichen didn’t deny anything. “Then, what do you think we should do next?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: Get rid of the Jade Emperor’s foolishly loyal ones and improve the deities’ impression of you. Oh yeah, now that you’ve gotten the identity as the chief, the Heavenly Court will be united one day. Now, all that left’s the Underworld and the Immortal Region.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You really have faith in me. But you want me to do something to the Underworld and Immortal Region as well? Say… isn’t that a bit too much?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: What’s wrong with that? Isn’t our ultimate goal to unite the Three Realms to defend against the Demon Realm? Don’t you want to save Xiao Yumei?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s expression instantly darkened when Xiao Yumei was mentioned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I really didn’t want to mention it before, but since you got Grandpa Zuo out, couldn’t you have gotten Xiao Yumei out as well? Just what do you want to do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: Isn’t leaving her there fine? At the very least, your hatred towards the demons will not waver with her here. Everything we’re doing for you is so that you can deal with the Demon Realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow,” Ye Zichen said darkly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: I have no other choice. I’m just a selfish person like this. Act well according to what I said. Trust me, I won’t screw you over. You should understand that very well, right?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Yeah!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>How could I not?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled wryly. If there was no surprise, then according to what he had heard using the Great Dao of Heaven’s Birth and his guesses, the system was actually…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Honestly, he really didn’t want to admit unless he had no other choice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: It seems like you understand very well, so I won’t say any more. Oh yeah, your strength might be a bit weak to handle what is to come, so I’ll give you a present.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Present.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye ZIchen was shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment, a red packet appeared on the screen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was from the system!</span></p>
