 <p><span style>Chapter 332 – Fallen</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How’s it possible?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stood up from the floor emotionlessly, while the wings behind him continuously fluttered. The huge wind produced caused all the decorations to fly all over the place, while he…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How’s it possible!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He stared straight at the man in front of him. He had already lost his ability to think, and only knew subconsciously that…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had to defeat that man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fallen… Hahahaha, Fallen!” the man smiled crazily. I didn’t think that the weak woman and I would actually give birth to a Fallen. Hahahaha…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He suddenly stopped laughing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s first hit mercilessly landed on the man’s stomach, and following that, Ye Zichen relentlessly swung his fists towards the man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Domination!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He completely dominated the man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the man, who was beaten to the point of coughing up blood by Ye Zichen, could only struggle to defend himself. There was no possibility for him to fight back at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite that, he continued to smile in excitement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fallen, as expected of the greatest bloodline of the demon race. It truly is so strong that it excites me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen kicked the man, causing the man to hit the wall and crack it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the man coughed up blood, he still chose to speak up with a smile of anticipation, “My good son, come with daddy! Don’t stay in a small place like the Modern Realm, this place will only cover up your talent as a Fallen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the only response was a merciless punch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My good son…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Another punch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did the man notice that Ye Zichen’s eyes were void of any consciousness. At that moment, Ye Zichen lacked the ability to think, he was merely acting based on instinct, just like how animals acted upon their instincts to hunt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ve lost yourself? Heh… So useless!” The man suddenly snorted coldly. Not long later, his hair and eyes also turned blood red, while his skin turned an even darker shade than Ye Zichen’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A vomit-inducing wave of spiritual energy spread out from his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Fatty Yin, who stared closely at the two people in front of him hesitated to act.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Trash is trash. I thought you could awaken and become a Fallen, but your consciousness was actually devoured,” the man cursed, while manifesting two black balls of energy from his hands. “It seems like I thought too much into it. How could a pure Fallen be conceived with that mere woman!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He combined the two balls of energy, which turned into a small ball of light with a diameter of one centimeter, and shot it towards Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sneer on the man’s face became ever more apparent the moment he saw Ye Zichen raise his hand.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He actually wants to use his bare hands to grab the shot. This shot’s a condensed version, and even if a Human Immortal level expert grabbed it with their bare hands, it would still shoot straight through their hands.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty Yin was also extremely shocked, causing him to roar, “Don’t…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen could not hear his call. Ye Zichen merely reached forward with his hand…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The smile on the man’s face became more cruel, only to turn into shock moments later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The energy sphere did not explode.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen grabbed it with a single hand, looked at it with a hint of curiosity in his eyes, then popped it into his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Impossible!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man shook his head intensely. No one should be able to consume the energy bombs that other people released. Even extremely powerful people were only able to capture them, but were unable to digest it, not to mention being able to do it so easily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the truth was in front of his eyes after all. After the energy bomb was swallowed, Ye Zichen’s skin color appeared to be more nourished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Burp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen burped comfortably, then reached out his hand like a kid that just ate a candy that they like…</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as if he was saying… Give me a few more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is impossible!” the man no longer remained as laid back as he had initially. He shook his head forcefully, and manifested a bunch of energy bombs around him…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He shot them out without any hesitation, but Ye Zichen was able to receive all of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And the moment he caught one, he popped it into his mouth, swallowed it, and digested it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This… This…” the man’s eyes twitched.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Ye Zichen burped once more, he licked his faint purple lips with his crimson tongue…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He smashed his fist against the man’s chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man’s chest instantly dented inward, while blood spurt out of his mouth uncontrollably. The purple blood became ever more apparent on the snow-white floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Ye Zichen swung his fists over and over again, the man had no way of resisting at all. If Ye Zichen wished to, he could even smash the man’s head with but a single punch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But he didn’t…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He only swung his fist at the man’s body. It was as if the man was one of his beloved toys, and he didn’t want to cause the man to be ruined so quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A good ten-odd minutes later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man’s arms and legs were already smashed to pieces, while his chest was completely indented. Normally speaking, these sort of injuries would have killed a person several times over already, but the man continued to stare closely at Ye Zichen with a hint of surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, enough.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty Yin walked over with squinted eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen turned around stiffly and looked at Fatty Yin with his emotionless eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gulp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty Yin silently gulped. </span><i><span style>This sort of gaze is way too threatening.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could this really be a Fallen? But didn’t they say that the demon race is already extinct? Also, that man should be a descendant of the demon race as well…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I, Lord Fatty, have never dealt with a Fallen before.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As Fatty Yin looked at the deadly gaze of Ye Zichen, he licked his lips, then retreated with a coy smile, then pointed at the man, who was being beaten up, “Please continue!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he retreated in a flattering manner, his expression immediately turned sullen. </span><i><span style>God knows if Ye Zichen is going to break out of that Fallen status. If he continues on like this…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Ice Empress, how long do you need to heal your body? Hurry up and freeze him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m already trying my best!” Lu Lu frowned, while she answered with a solemn look on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you think is going on? Laozi has never come into contact with situations like this!” Fatty Yin said speechlessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen is a normal person, but he probably has the blood of the demon race within him, which was activated for some reason. Since his original form is not that of a demon it will be possible to wake him up. But… it can only be done by someone he holds close to his heart,” Lu Lu frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Close to his heart? Then I, Lord Fatty, isn’t going to work. He seemed like he was going to eat me just now. How about you give it a shot? Don’t you get along with him?” Fatty Yin asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not confident about that!” Lu Lu smiled wryly. “I don’t want to annoy him myself either.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what do you say we should do?” Fatty Yin had no idea what to do next.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen tilted his head to look at his beloved toy lying on the ground. Then, he set his gaze upon the man’s head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He moved his arm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Clap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A white hand grabbed hold of his arm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, wake up!”</span></p>
 <p></p>

 <p></p>
 <p><b>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</b>How's it possible!?&nbsp;How's it possible!? HOW'S IT POSSIBLE!?</p>
