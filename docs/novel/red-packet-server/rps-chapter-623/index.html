 <p><span style>Chapter 623 – We’ll Go Back</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Jiayi revealed a complicated expression when she heard the familiar voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This man had often been the cause of her mood swings in the Modern Realm, then… she arrived in this one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The foreign environment caused her to nearly lose her mind until she met her dear mentor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She felt like everything had ended and had to start over from the beginning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had once thought that she was the only one who had transmigrated. However, she once again met </span><i><span style>him</span></i><span style> here.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is this fate?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Li Jiayi smiled wryly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, after a while, she came back to herself and pursed her lips, “My master is hurrying me to return. I’m leaving.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Li Jiayi turned around to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen quickly caught up and smiled, “Let me walk you out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had been quite a while since they saw each other and as she smelled the scent of the man beside her… She began to fiddle with her hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sensing the awkward atmosphere between them, Ye Zichen smiled and broke the silence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did you come to Maple City?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It was just along the way,” Li Jiayi answered causally, but the truth was that…</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had intentionally asked others for Ye Zichen’s location and deliberately came over to see him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did everyone at Mount Supreme come out?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, quite a lot of people are still inside. Mount Supreme is not open to the public and new people often go in to test their luck,” Li Jiayi answered plainly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see,” Ye Zichen nodded, then suddenly didn’t know what to say.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Awkwardness surrounded them once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the very beginning, Li Jiayi gazed forward as she fiddled with the hems of her clothes and occasionally stole a few peeks at Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He feels more reliable and… manlier…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“H-How are you after coming here?” Li Jiayi suddenly asked after a long silence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m doing fine. You know me, I’m not the kind to let myself suffer setbacks,” Ye Zichen shrugged. “You were at my own faction just now. Leisure House… Hmm, it’ll be equal to your Hundred Flowers Gate in the future.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re still so amazing,” Li Jiayi smiled softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded, “How’re you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m doing pretty good as well. Master cares a lot about me and I’m very lucky to have the talent they always speak of. As the chief disciple, my junior and senior sisters are all very nice to me,” Li Jiayi smiled gently, while her body trembled a little.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noticing that, Ye Zichen put his hand on her shoulder and comforted, “It must be very hard on you to arrive in such a foreign place, right? Don’t worry, we’ll definitely go back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We will?” Li Jiayi’s eyes lit up and looked at Ye Zichen in surprise. “Can we really go back?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course. Believe me, we will.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Junior sister!” At that moment, a slightly displeased voice sounded out from behind the two.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They turned back and saw that a man in a red and yellow striped robe and carrying a long sword on his back was standing in front of the teleportation portal to the Hundred Flowers Gate with a frown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior Brother Yin,” Li Jiayi nodded towards him with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye ZIchen was momentarily stunned, causing him to raise his eyebrows, “The Hundred Flowers Gate has male disciples?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Most of us are female, but there is a line underneath Martial Uncle Liu who are mostly male. They are mainly around to protect the safety of us female disciples when we venture out,” Li Jiayi explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But I feel like his protection puts you in more danger,” Ye Zichen twitched his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man with the sword also walked over and frowned towards Li Jiayi, “Martial Uncle wanted you to return, but since he still didn’t see you, he told me to come and get you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve troubled you, Senior Brother Yin. I met an old friend on the way, so I chatted for a while longer,” Li Jiayi replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old friend?” Senior Brother Yi scanned Ye Zichen judgmentally with an arrogant attitude that only served to discomfort Ye Zichen. Then, he twitched his mouth. “Heh, since you’ve already met, then hurry back. Martial Uncle is very worried about you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay,” Li Jiayi nodded, then parted reluctantly with Ye Zichen. “Everything you said just now was true, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye ZIchen naturally understood that she meant returning to the Modern Realm, so he nodded, “Of course.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I believe you. I’m off,” thus, she entered the portal reluctantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did he walk over with a snort of disdain, “I don’t know what you promise junior sister. She is young and doesn’t know a lot about the world, so she might have been tricked by your flowery words. Regardless, she is still the chief disciple of our Hundred Flowers Gate. Brat… enough is enough is my advice for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His sword flew up into the air and danced around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, he retracted his sword and disappeared into the portal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What the hell!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen returned to Leisure House, he found Stone and co. wondering about how to deal with the area Ye Zichen melted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Stone turned around and saw Ye Zichen return, he immediately went over, while Xue Qi put on a strange look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I did all this?” Ye Zichen scratched his head with a coy smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Stone rolled his eyes in annoyance, “Yeah, it’s all you. Wow, you really are amazing. You managed to burn the house down and made a big hole in the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry, sorry,” Ye zichen scratched his head, while he cursed the system.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This damn system. Just a simple Malteser from it caused such huge trouble and even increased the number of wings I have.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Xue Qi walked over with a dark look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He stared at Ye Zichen for a while, “Brother Ye, you… truly have nothing to do with the demons, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No,” Ye Zichen answered affirmatively. “I can assure you that I’m not someone from the Demon Race. I don’t want to explain in that much detail. Believe me if you will, but if you don’t… I’ll leave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’re you doing? We’re all bros here!” Stone hooked his arms around Ye Zichen and Xue Qi’s shoulders. “Let’s stop talking about all that. C’mon, let’s grab a drink.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Never mind, I still have some things to handle, so just drink with Brother Ye,” Xue Qi turned around to leave. However, right before he stopped, he stopped for a moment. “I believe you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded towards him. Then after sending him off, he smiled. “I have some things to do as well. Oh yeah… Can you get me a room?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I already arranged it for you. Lil’ Lan, take your Big Brother Zichen to his new room,” Stone waved his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ Lan immediately skipped over and giggled, “Big Brother Zichen, let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen finally laid down on the bed in his new room, he thought back to what had happened earlier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What worried him the most was actually the Blood Zombie.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>We couldn’t find the jade pendant Yellow Hair lost. Could Hanba have gotten out of it?</span></i></p>

 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Original Chapter Teaser:</strong>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>It has already been so long since I arrived here... Everything feels... like a dream.&nbsp;But yet,&nbsp;it's so real. The danger, the people... Everything.&nbsp;Sometimes, I wonder if my life before was a dream.</p>
 <p>I arrived here, alone... Without anyone else. In a land completely foreign to me... Master took me in, and I somehow began learning how to cultivate. I ended up in the Hundred Flower Gate as the chief disciple for some reason. With my new found life, I was... not happy, but... I began to felt like it wouldn't be so bad. After all, it's not like anyone from my previous life was here.</p>
 <p>Then Mount Supreme occurred.&nbsp;I went over and... saw him.</p>
 <p>The one who made my heart throb.</p>
 <p>The one who fills my head with images of him.</p>
 <p>The one who did not care about my fake birthmark.</p>
 <p>I... wasn't sure how to face him.</p>
 <p>Then... he disappeared.</p>
 <p>It took me a while for me to find him again, and when I got news of where he was, I came immediately,&nbsp;only to find someone trying to kill him. So I did what I could, and tried to stop the man.</p>
 <p>And now?&nbsp;I... really don't know how to face the one I've been waiting nights and days to see. I... really don't know.</p>
