 <p><span style>Chapter 679 – The Two Clowns</span></p>
 <p><span style>In front of Qiu Yuan’s bedroom in the Pool City’s City Lord’s manor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>City Lord Qiu had already knocked on Qiu Yuan’s door multiple times, but his room was still shut tight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Creak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>City Lord Qiu pushed the door open and entered the room with a frown. Before he could say anything, he noticed that Qiu Yuan’s room was in a complete mess. “What are you doing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn’t you say that a war is going to break out soon and we can’t defend Pool City anymore? These are treasures used so much effort to get. I can’t just throw them away,” Qiu Yuan said as he sat on the floor and arranged the toys like remote-controlled planes and cars in front of him. As he did so, he continuously muttered. “The spatial ring is too small, but I don’t want to leave them behind. Just which ones should I bring with me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>City Lord Qiu nearly coughed up blood when he heard that. He walked up to the pile and kicked it, causing the toys that Qiu Yuan had spent a lot of time to arrange to scatter across the floor. “Can you let me worry less? These trash…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dad, what are you doing!?” Qiu Yuan glared as Immortal King leveled spiritual energy subconsciously flowed out from his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The truth was that City Lord Qiu had already gotten used to beating Qiu Yuan. However, his son was completely different now. The strength of an Immortal King was not just for show.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He really felt a bit worried when he felt his son’s terrifying spiritual pressure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I spent so much effort in arranging them together, now that you kicked it, I have to do it all again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All of the people in all the outer region’s cities have left, we’re the only ones remaining, and you actually still have time for this trash. I…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, please don’t get angry. How about this? You didn’t use too much of the space in your special ring, right? Give it to me now so I can pack my treasures,” Qiu Yuan replied cheekily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>City Lord Qiu glared at him angrily with a snort, “Don’t even think about it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>An hour later…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wouldn’t it be fine if you just gave me the ring from the get go? You forced me to take it from you. Seriously…” Qiu Yuan squatted on the floor and put away the toys on the floor into a spatial ring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for City Lord Qiu…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was being tied up on a chair with his spiritual energy sealed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shitty brat, hurry up and release me!” City Lord Qiu shouted from the chair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, some footsteps rang out outside the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s not an empty city, there’s someone inside!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s great. Go in and take a look, then capture them. That way, we can report back to Lord Black Dragon!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, the room was kicked open.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There really are scums remaining!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A hook appeared in the thin demon’s hand, which he reached towards Qiu Yuan’s back. However, before he got too close…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A clear crack sounded out underneath his feet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qiu Yuan turned around, then watched as his toys get stomped to pieces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh. Heh heh heh…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You dare to laugh? Die!” The demon kicked the shattered toys to pieces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qiu Yuan squinted his eyes, while a raging aura radiated out from his body, “You ruined my treasures. You actually dare to ruin my treasures!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gulp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The demon gulped and didn’t even notice his hook hit the ground. He smiled dryly and retreated slowly, “It’s a misunderstanding, a misunderstanding!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stay here and compensate with your life for my treasures!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing the huge commotion, the bald demon sovereign instantly hurried over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was when he saw Qiu Yuan step into the air in battle armor, while holding a flaming staff in one hand and the demon soldiers, who had been burnt to charcoal in his other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He is your guy, right? COMPENSATE! MY! REMOTE! CONTROL! AIRPLANE!”</span></p>
 <p><span style> ……</span></p>
 <p><span style>“City Lord Luo, don’t worry,” the white-robed man patted the city lord’s shoulder with a smile. “Qiu Yuan, the Chosen One, is over at Pool City. Although it isn’t quite the same as our plans, it won’t have too big of an impact on it. It might even be more beneficial for us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you mean by that?” Great Emperor Qingming asked in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The demons think that they are the oriole behind the mantis! But if all of the cities they attack are empty, they really might get suspicious. Having someone remaining in Pool City would actually make sense for a careful one like Black Dragon,” the white-robed man replied with a smile. The rest nodded, only to hear him speak up once more. “Qiu Yuan’s in Pool City, but Maple City…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Demon scum, let your Grandpa Gou Gou go if you dare. I’m going to fight you solo!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A young man in beggar like clothes and a strand of hair sticking up above his head was forced to kneel onto the ground by several demon soldiers in front of the luxurious City Lord manor’s meeting room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite that, the beggar young man still had a hostile look on his face as he glared fiercely at Black Dragon, who sat in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Engulf the World… What is your relationship to the Spiritual Monkeys of the Endless Beast Region?” Black Dragon had a cup of tea in his mouth. After he finished asking the question, he muttered to himself. “The people of the Three Realms really know how to enjoy themselves. I didn’t notice they have such a nice treasure when I came here last time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>“You country bumpkin who has never even drunk tea before,” the beggar teenager couldn’t help but snicker. “You are already so happy with a jasmine tea bag that costs a mere two yuan? My Boss Ye has treated me to Da Hong Pao<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> before. Do you know what that is? It’s even more expensive than lollipops!”</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bumpkin?” Black Dragon put down his cup of tea on the table and stood up, then walked towards the young man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you want to do? Hit me? I’m telling you, I’m afraid of a lot of things, but I’m not afraid of getting beaten up,” said the young man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brat, answer honestly when I’m still in a good mood. Just what is your relationship with the spiritual monkeys!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why should I tell you?” the young man twitched his mouth. “I suggest you let me go now. Otherwise, if my boss finds out that you captured me, you’ll be in for a treat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss? Who is the boss you’re talking about?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, I’ll scared you to death,” the young man snorted. “I’m telling you, my boss is the chief of Leisure House. Ye Zichen, Chief Ye! Now, if you know what you’re doing, then hurry up and…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? Ye Zichen?” Black Dragon raised his eyebrows and smiled. “Interesting!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Luo Wei, describe to me what the person in Maple City who started fighting the demons looked like,” Ye Zichen stared at Luo Wei nervously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luo Wei looked at him in confusion. He did not understand why Ye Zichen acted so. “I didn’t pay much attention to him, but he was rather special. He had a strand of hair sticking up on his head, and was holding something called a lollipop in his mouth. He was so fierce. No matter how many demons there were, he merely charged in with a stick, while shouting something like… Err… ‘Boss, I’m coming to save you’!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It really is him!” Ye Zichen couldn’t help but face palm and sigh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The white-robed man also smiled wryly, “That clown…”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Original Chapter Teaser:</strong>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Wait, a clown!? In Maple City!? Please don't tell me its who I think it is...</p>
 <p>I can guess who it might be in Pool City. It definitely isn't City Lord Qiu, so&nbsp;it's definitely Qiu Yuan. He is an&nbsp;Immortal King now, so I don't think any of the demons can match up to him except their leader and that old one.</p>
 <p>But at Maple City... It would be fine if it's anyone else except who I think it is. He&nbsp;can't take care of himself at all!&nbsp;And he's rash, so&nbsp;I'm pretty sure it's him... No, i can't allow any harm to come to him. He might be strong, but I don't think he can beat any of those demon sovereigns...Yep, that's it, we&nbsp;definitely have to go rescue him right now.</p>
 <p>But first... let's make sure that it's really him...</p>
