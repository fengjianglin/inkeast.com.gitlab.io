 <p><span style>Chapter 107 – You’re sick</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ve recovered pretty well. It’ll be pretty much done when I come treat you next Monday. Now, you can try to get your legs to take more burden and try to stand up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen patted Huang Yi’s waist and stood up from the chair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s qi manipulation was also becoming more and more fluid through his treatment of Huang Yi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For one ting, he didn’t sweat like he had just been fished out of water.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, wipe your sweat,” Huang Shengmei handed the towel over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled with a nod.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Huang Yi, who was on the bed said excitedly, “I can really stand up?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, would Zichen-ge lie to you?” Ye Zichen smiled without denying it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Yi rolled around and looked up at the ceiling with a smile, “Oh yeah, Zichen-ge, what was with the question about asking me if I wanted to go pro?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My friend started a team, and they’re lacking a top laner. If you want to go pro after you recover, then I can introduce you. Of course, it would depend on your wishes, if you don’t want to…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course I want to,” Huang Yi slammed the bed with his both his hands and a resolute expression, “Going pro has always been my dream. I have only watched them play at home before, it would be amazing if I can play as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I’ll bring you over to have a look when you recover,” Ye Zichen patted Huang Yi’s shoulders, then pulled Huang Shengmei out of the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huang Yi recovered really well. I recommend you to ask for leave from the hospital and take care of him completely at home for a week. He should be able to stand up when I come next Monday. Of course, you would have to help him do some physical therapy for his leg.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Doesn’t that mean that I can’t treat you to dinner again?” Huang Shengmei frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen let out a helpless long sigh, then knocked her on the head, “The point you grabbed onto doesn’t seem right, is eating a meal with me more important than your little brother standing up now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course it’s important,” Huang Yi, who was in the bedroom, suddenly said loudly. “Zichen-ge helped us so much, it’s far too normal for sis to treat you to a meal. Don’t worry about me, I have stayed at home by myself all the time before.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Yi’s assistance caused Huang Shengmei’s eyes to brighten as she looked at Ye Zichen in anticipation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since they said all that, it would be a bit wrong for Ye Zichen to refuse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, Ye Zichen could only nod and accept it without any other choice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Huang Shengmei still needed to return to the hospital to work, the two of them just found a restaurant near the hospital.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, when he was with her, Ye Zichen felt rather…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Awkward!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The tying of their strings came too randomly and their intimacy level rose way too randomly. The promotion of their status to lovers was not natural at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Instead, it felt rather forced.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sat on the chair, unsure of what to do, after ordering a few dishes. Meanwhile, Huang Shengmei held her head with her hands and glanced over his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uhmm…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened?” Huang Shengmei raised her eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen licked his lips with a brief hesitation, then laughed softly, “Did you just graduate form the University of Medical Science?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pretty much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s pretty amazing, you managed to become a resident just after graduation…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Perhaps I was rather good at the classes in class, and I was taken care of by Elder Deng when I came to have my internship at the hospital.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Elder Deng, Deng Cheng?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm, that’s him,” Huang Shengmei nodded with a smile as admiration shone from her eyes. “Elder Deng is a figure with a huge amount of authority in the medical realm. I was rather lucky to gain his favor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, she looked over at Ye Zichen with a smile, “But you’re even more amazing. You actually saved someone that Elder Deng couldn’t.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I just got lucky!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It shouldn’t be. Shortcuts can’t be taken in order to save a patient. The fact that you managed to save him means that you have the ability,” Huang Shengmei’s tone was filled with admiration towards Ye Zichen. “Oh yeah, are you a student at the University of Medical Science, or…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I study veterinary medicine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Shengmei was shocked.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Veterinary medicine!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could vets save people now!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen also understood how much impact his reply had. It was fortunate that the waiters brought the dishes over at that moment, so they were able to move on from the topic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the meal, Ye Zichen found that Huang Shengmei was kind of different compared to the girls around him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Compared to Xiao Yumei’s sexiness, Su Yan and Xia Keke’s youthfulness, her beauty was a more intellectual one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shengmei!” A laughter sounded out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Huang Shengmei heard that, she immediately frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen also looked back when he saw this. He saw a chubby man, who wasn’t very tall, walk towards them from the staircase of the second floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You know him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s the vice-supervisor of our hospital, Wu Deyou! He is essentially half a boss towards me,” Huang Shengmei frowned. “This guy often hints at a rather affable attitude towards me, but I have played dumb since he didn’t make it clear.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Unspoken rules!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Zeze!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows. At the same time, Wu Deyou also walked in front of them with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eating with your little brother?” Wu Deyou laughed softly when he noticed Ye Zichen, causing him to phrase his question in a testing manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Shengmei pursed her lips, while Ye Zichen stood up with a smile, “You really know how to crack a joke. Let me introduce myself, I’m Shengmei’s boyfriend, Ye Zichen!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Huang’s boyfriend,” After a brief tensed expression, the smile returned to Wu Deyou’s face. However, his tone and manner of addressed changed. “Lil’ Huang, you just graduated from the University of Medical Science. It wasn’t easy for you to become a resident. Of course, you performed pretty well in the hospital recently. Actually, I had wanted to step you up towards an attending physician, but you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Deyou sighed, then looked meaningfully towards Ye Zichen, “You are at the climbing part of your career, you can’t be like this. Of course, I’m not telling you not to get a boyfriend, it’s just that a boyfriend will cause you to lose concentration. Say, you are always in the surgery room, if anything happens…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is no need for Supervisor Wu to worry about it, I know what I’m doing,” Huang Shengmei stood up from the chair with a peaceful smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A light flashed across Wu Deyou’s eyes as he snorted, “Fine, if you don’t listen to your elders, then you’re just going to suffer!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Supervisor Wu shook his head as he walked towards the outside. As he walked, he muttered to himself, “It seems like you have to calm down for a few years before becoming an attending physician.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Supervisor Wu, wait,” Before Huang Shengmei spoke, Ye Zichen suddenly raised his hand and stopped him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm?” Wu Deyou stopped after hearing that and looked towards Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Supervisor Wu, did you know? You’re sick!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen replied sternly.</span></p>
