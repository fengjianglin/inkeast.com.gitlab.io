 <p><span style>Chapter 198 – Xie Bian’s Grandson</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen felt troubled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stared at the smiling young man in traditional Chinese clothing and felt cold sweat drip all over his body.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>One physical and one spiritual soul.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you say just now? You want one of my physical and one of my spiritual souls?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Legends says that a person only had three physical and six spiritual souls…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>This guy wanted one of his physical and one of his spiritual soul…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Why do you want that from me for? Bro, let’s discuss it a bit more, can’t you ask for something else?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No,” the young man wearing traditional Chinese clothing continued to smile warmly. “The choice is in your hands. We, the Xie family, never do forced trades. If you want to take these two ghosts and these two Heavenly Court monkeys away, then leave one spiritual and one physical soul here… If you don’t want to, then the door is over there, please!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen turned his head around and saw a white door suddenly appear inside the garden that was originally surrounded by metal fences.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The human realm laid outside the door…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>With the appearance of this door, it seems like it was no longer the realm of the living.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Gulp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen gulped, then looked towards Liu Qing and the little ghost.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, leave…” Liu Qing’s face was filled with determination and resolution. All of this was caused by her willfulness, so she knew that she should take the responsibility.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In her heart, she didn’t want Ye Zichen to take the risk for her either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for the little ghost…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Ye, save me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, the two monkeys didn’t speak at all!</span></p>
 <p><span style>They didn’t find it right for them to speak at all. As bodyguards, they actually allowed themselves to get captured…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It was embarrassing their great king too much!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Leave?</span></i><span style> To be honest, Ye Zichen really wanted to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Ye Zichen didn’t know what losses he would suffer by just randomly leaving a spiritual and a physical soul here, it sounded rather creepy, so he was afraid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The door was only a few meters behind him. As long as he turned around, he would be able to leave in less than two seconds!</span></p>
 <p><span style>But the damn sense of responsibility…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Made him unable to step away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There really is no discussion to it?” Ye Zichen asked in a testing tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man in traditional Chinese clothing shook his head, “No.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then wait a moment, a spiritual and a physical soul is no small matter. Let me consider it a bit,” With that, Ye Zichen took out his phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The 4G signal on his phone had been replaced by a small wiggly line. Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows at this, but didn’t think so much, and instead sent a bunch of messages to White Impermanence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sis, I found Liu Qing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But there’s a brat that’s not listening at all here. He’s determined for one of my spiritual and one of my physical souls. Are those important? If it’s not, then I’ll give it to him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>White Impermanence, who was leading the other little ghosts in a search was instantly stunned when she saw the message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then she quickly replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can’t give it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why can’t I? It’s not okay even if I don’t. This brat is determined to get it from me. What am I supposed to do!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you an idiot!? Can you just casually give that away!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>White Impermanence cursed angrily, but then she replied once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tell me your location, I’ll come over to find you right now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m in a garden, but this garden doesn’t seem like one from the mortal realm. I don’t know where this place is either…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows at the young man after sending the message, “Bro, where are we? I have a friend that’s coming over.”</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>“Friend?” The young man smiled wildly. “Number 439, Ergouzi Road<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>, Peony Region, Three Lives Temple Lily County.”</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen twitched his mouth…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the hell is this place!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at the young man’s meaningful smile, then sent the address over with a look of confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>White Impermanence, who was waiting outside for Ye Zichen’s message, was instantly stunned when she saw the reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How did you end up in the Ghost Marshal, White Impermanence’s, home?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen replied with a look of complete confusion.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ghost Marshal?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>White Impermanence!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style><span>“You’re at Xie Bian’s <a id="footnoteref-2" href="#footnote-2">[2]</a> home, that’s the Xie Household!”</span></span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was rather stunned when he saw White Impermanence’s reply. He had definitely heard about Xie Bian before.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The Two Impermanence Lords.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>White Impermanence, Xie Bian.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen turned his head with a look of confusion and eyed the young man, who was standing calmly opposite him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, what is your relationship to Xie Bian?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s my grandpa!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately smiled in a way that would cause people to feel comfortable. </span><i><span style>No wonder this brat was so fierce, no matter what, the monkeys were of the Spiritual Body level, but they couldn’t even move when under the control of the two bodyguards.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Fine, this a Ghost Marshal’s grandson.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Then wouldn’t those bodyguards be beyond amazing!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen waved slightly towards the young man, then quickly replied on his phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what? Liu Qing, my two monkeys and your little ghost is still in the hands of Xie Bian’s grandson…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait for me to come over!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled dryly and put his phone back into his pocket after seeing White Impermanence’s reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh wow, you’re actually Great Marshal Xie, Xie Bian’s grandson, seriously… There was much offense just now, much offense!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph,” The young man snickered, then snorted. “You went to look for someone, right? Is he going to be enough? If he isn’t, then hurry up and sign it. If you’re not signing it, then hurry up and screw off.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Great Marshal Xie’s grandson doesn’t seem to have a good temper.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, listening to what you’re saying,” Ye Zichen raised his hand up to try and get close.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, before Ye Zichen’s hand reached the young man, a folded fan appeared in the latter’s hand and flicked Ye Zichen’s wrist away, “Stay away from me, a mere mortal actually dares to touch this young master.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Cocky.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Fine, I’ll endure it.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>You are f*cking Xie Bian’s grandson, so laozi will submit.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded wryly and took a step back. At this moment, White Impermanence suddenly entered from the door to the garden.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Third Young Master,” White Impermanence quickly walked over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man in traditional Chinese clothing raised his eyebrows at her, then frowned, “Who are you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s me, your Rou-jiejie.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>White Impermanence immediately took off her hat…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>The photo White Impermanence sent me that day was real.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Gold hair and amber eyes. She had an exotic kind of beauty!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had originally thought that it was a photo that White Impermanence had stole from the internet, he didn’t think that it really was her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rou-jiejie,” The Xie family’s grandson was stunned for a moment after seeing White Impermanence, then revealed a joyous expression. “You haven’t come to play with me for a long time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s no helping it, older sister was busy,” White Impermanence raised her hand and caressed the young man’s head a few times before they begun to chat intimately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was shocked as he watched from the sides.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This White Impermanence certainly had some contacts, no wonder she could become a White Impermanence intern. So she knows the Xie family.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could it be some sort of dirty deals…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Zeze, I can’t have those sort of thoughts!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why am I so impure!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>”Leilei, that person is good friends with older sister,” White Impermanence finally brought up Ye Zichen after chatting for a while. “Can you consider letting his friends go?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“About this…” Xie Lei frowned, then twitched his mouth. “That’s against the rules, we, the Xie family, have always…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Older sister knows the Xie family’s rules,” White Impermanence caressed Xie Lei’s hair and smiled. “but he’s a mortal, one spiritual and one physical soul is way too important for him. There are plenty of fun things in the mortal realm, you can get him to trade those with you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He can send toys from the mortal realm to the Underworld?” Xie Lei was stunned for a brief moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course he can, this person is really amazing. He can WeChat we people from the Underworld and send us red packets.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Xie Lei’s eyes lit up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He quickly walked over to Ye Zichen and stared at the latter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, add me on WeChat.”</span></p>
