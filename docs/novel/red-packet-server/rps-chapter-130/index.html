 <p><span style>Chapter 130 – Fifty years of Lifespan</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is it possible!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>King Qinguang fell into deep thoughts as he looked at the message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Underworld ruled over the life and death of everyone in the mortal realm, a mortal’s lifespan was set from the moment they were born, there had never been any talk of adding lifespan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he wasn’t sure of the other person’s identity if he was to refuse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since they could release him, they might be able to capture him again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Qinguang answered after thinking about it or a while, “Master, human lifespans are predetermined, we’re not in the place to casually add more, doing so will break the regulations.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cannot casually add more means that you can. I was just asking if it was possible!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even White Impermanence was shocked by Ye Zichen’s strong attitude. She had never seen anyone who dared to speak like that to King Qinguang after so many years of being in the Underworld.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“King Chujiang, who exactly is this person? Didn’t you say he contacted you before?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since King Qinguang did not dare to make a retort against Ye Zichen, he could only look to King Chujiang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know either. At the time, White Impermanence said that someone could help elder brother out, so I contacted him. He said that he’s a mere mortal and discussed the conditions with me…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mortal?” King Qinguang frowned. “What are the conditions?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He asked me of the method to revive someone who died before their time,” King Chujiang answered honestly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Adding lifespan for a mortal, and a way to revive a mortal…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Qinguang stayed silent for a moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The phone of White Impermanence, who was in the operation room, rang in a timely manner. When she took out her phone, she frowned a bit, “King Qinguang messaged to ask me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Give it to me,” Ye Zichen reached out to take White Impermanence’s phone and looked at the message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Qinguang: What exactly is the identity of that master?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“King Qinguang, don’t try to get anything out of her. White Impermanence’s phone is in my hands. Give me an answer, is it possible!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen handed the phone back to White Impermanence after sending the message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s not so good for you to speak like that to King Qinguang using my phone, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s wrong with it?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows. “He wanted to get you to tell him. Even if I didn’t say that, would you speak casually?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course not,” White impermanence replied quietly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what’s the issue?” Ye Zichen shrugged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Qinguang, who was within the first hall of the Underworld, was instantly shocked when he saw White Impermanence’s reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He actually used White Impermanence’s phone. How could a mere mortal touch an item of the Underworld?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Elder Brother, if it’s no good, then just add it,” King Chujiang advised.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How is that alright, it will be trouble once again if the Heavenly Court finds out,” King Qinguang was rather hesitant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you afraid of, just tell that master about the trouble in doing so. Since he’s so amazing in the Heavenly Court, there shouldn’t be any issues.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>King QInguang was stunned for a moment hearing King Chujiang’s words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His words made quite a bit of sense!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master, it’s not impossible to add years to the lifespans for mortals…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tell me everything.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Qinguang got slightly annoyed when he saw Ye Zichen’s strong reply.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck, I have been a Yama King for such a long time and even the Jade Emperor doesn’t dare to speak to me like that.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Elder Brother, don’t get angry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang quickly advised when he saw King Qingung’s terrible expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Underworld is under the management of the Heavenly Court. If I casually add lifespan to a mortal, then the Heavenly Court might very well use it as an excuse to do something. Recently, the relationship between the Underworld and the Heavenly Court is very strained.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll take responsibility if anything happens.” Ye Zichen replied without thinking. “Just add it, if the Heavenly Court really dares to seek you out for trouble, then tell me, I’ll deal with all of it for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two Yama Kings were shocked when they saw this reply.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Truly an air of dominance.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>From that person’s tone, he didn’t think much of the Heavenly Court at all.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just what sort of person could be like this!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Since they had this master’s verbal promise, King Qinguang also clenched his teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, who does master want to have lifespan added to.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yang Yushi of Huaxia’s capital. Her father is Yang Zhen, I want to add fifty years of lifespan to Yang Yushi!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem, please wait a moment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Qinguang directly went to get the Book of Life and Death. Ye Zichen let out a sigh of relief and looked at Yang Yushi, who was lying on the bed without moving, with a sigh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re so amazing, you actually got King Qinguang to submit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>White Impermanence exclaimed at the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, the little ghost girl, Liu Qing, also floated out and eyed Yang Yushi, was was lying on the bed, “You’re about to successfully pick up a girl again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Girl, why are you always focusing on me picking up girls?” Ye Zichen looked up with a playful smile. “You can’t have fallen in love with me, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk, shameless,” Liu Qing snorted with a pout. “I’m telling the truth. Girls know that a hero saving the beauty is very cliché, but they still can’t help but fall for the hero. You saved Yang Yushi, adding onto the fact that you two have a story, do you think she’ll be able to forget about you after this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won’t let her know,” Ye Zichen’s expression revealed a hint of sadness. “I won’t affect her life. Since Yang Zhen has already the path that he thinks will make his daughter happy for her, I will not destroy it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Anyone could hear the loneliness in his words, while Liu Qing stuck out her tongue and floated obediently to the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>White Impermanence was shocked for a bit, but did not say anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, only tension and the cold remained in the emergency room, without anything else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen took out his phone after a long silence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang: Master, we have already added lifespan for Yang Yushi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pursed his lips with a smile as he touched Yang Yushi’s forehead, before he shrugged towards Liu Qing and White Impermanence, “Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You really aren’t going to stay here? If the person she sees immediately is you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen interrupted Liu Qing before she finished, “I said it already, I won’t destroy her fate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen left the operation room without any reluctance to part, Zu Siliang immediately walked over to him, “How is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately squinted his eyes when he saw this man, then lifted him by the collar with both of his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Take care of the woman inside properly. If she gets into any more danger, I won’t let you off regardless of your identity.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye ZIchen left Zu Siliang fall onto the floor, while the surrounding &nbsp;bodyguards already surrounded Ye Zichen with hostility.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What, you’re worried about your master?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Back off.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zu Siliang roared after standing up. When the surrounding bodyguards backed off, he smiled apologetically and walked in front of Ye Zichen, “Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hmmph.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen glanced at Zu SIliang coldly and looked around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where’s Wu Deyou?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I already dealt with him. “Zu Siliang said softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s expression relaxed a little when he heard this, “I’ll treat it as you having a brain.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How are you speaking to Director Zu?”</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>“Ancestor? <a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>” Ye Zichen smiled. “That’s your ancestor, not mine, move to the side.”</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pushed the angry-teenager-like bodyguards away, then turned around to leave. However, at that very moment, the closed door of the operation room…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Opened!</span></p>
