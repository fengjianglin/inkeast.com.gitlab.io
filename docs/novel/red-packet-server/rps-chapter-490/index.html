 <p><span style>Chapter 490 – Han Ba</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>We’re all screwed!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s that serious?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but feel a chill down his spine when he heard Xuan-Yuan Xiang’s words, and saw how serious her expression was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just what is that jade pendant for? Is it really that serious?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You want to know what that jade pendant is for?” Xuan-Yuan Xiang squinted her eyes and raised her eyebrows. “Han Ba is sealed inside.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Han Ba!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>One of the four zombie progenitors.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>And the Yellow Emperor’s daughter.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Rumor had it that after Han Ba died in a battle, she absorbed the corpse energy from the battlefield, and became the first zombie.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Han Ba had died in a battle before I even appeared with the Yellow Emperor. I only had found out about it from the Yellow Emperor after the dragon race created me. I only heard the Yellow Emperor mention just how strong Han Ba was. Back then, the demon realm’s Chiyou called upon the Heavenly Court’s Count of Wind and Lord of Rain, but neither of them were able to do anything to Han Ba!” Xuan-Yuan Xiang’s expression was filled with solemnity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing her words, Yellow Hair didn’t even dare to breathe. Even though he didn’t understand what she and his boss were talking about, he knew that he had done something horribly wrong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why would the jade pendant appear with him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lin Meng was proficient in sealing techniques, so the Yellow Emperor left the jade pendant with him. But this brat is great, he actually went and sold it. You actually dared to sell it for a measly ten celeste. Even that sky graded white jade is priceless, seriously…” Xuan-Yuan Xiang repeatedly shook her head as she snickered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yellow Hair lowered his head and muttered, “I didn’t know. Why are you so mean! Why are all the women beside Boss so scary!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You actually dare to retort to me?” Xuan-Yuan Xiang really wanted to slap Yellow Hair. </span><i><span style>He actually lost such an important thing. The fact that I can control my emotions, and haven’t quartered him is already very lucky.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright now. Don’t think pessimistically all the time. Although the jade pendant was lost, it doesn’t mean that other people know that Han Ba is sealed within it, right?” Ye Zichen smiled and comforted her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Xuan-Yuan Xiang pursed her lips, “What if I tell you that the seal would eventually loosen, I wonder…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen directly slapped Yellow Hair’s head without letting Xuan-Yuan Xiang finish. </span><i><span style>If Han Ba comes out during this period of time without anyone reinforcing the seal…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Then everyone is well and truly screwed!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You didn’t keep it, and instead sold it for a bite to eat. Seriously, are you a pig!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Never mind, stop getting angry with him,” what made Ye Zichen even more speechless was that Xuan-Yuan Xiang, who was just going to murder Yellow Hair, actually told him to not get angry at Yellow Hair…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The one to get angry first was you!” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, but then I thought about it. Getting angry is useless. Call that Zuo Mo girl over tomorrow. Isn’t she rather capable around here? Ask her to help us search for it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I suppose we can only do that!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen knocked Yellow Hair on the head. </span><i><span style>It seems like I’m going to have to cooperate with Zuo Mo again.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I wonder what I payment I need to offer up this time. I used Barrier Breaking Pills last time, do I have to give her Barrier Breaking Pills this time as well?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen returned to the manor, he saw smoke slowly swirl up from the courtyard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though the Spiritual Breeze Villagers had moved to the city, they still maintained the simple atmosphere they had while they were in the village. Although they weren’t living a life of farming and sewing, their habits did not change all too much.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Four round tables were placed in the pavilion in the middle of the courtyard. All of the villagers gathered at them, and chatted about Xue Lan’s cancellation of her engagement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kid, you went out for an entire day again!” Stone, who was chatting with the villagers, laughed loudly and stood up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xue Qi yanked Stone’s arm after hearing the way he addressed Ye Zichen, as if he was telling Stone not to act so recklessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who noticed that, wrapped his arm around Stone’s shoulder, and walked in front of Xue Qi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Village Chief Xue, just treat me as that little miner I was before. Otherwise, I feel really awkward by your differential treatment. If you continue like this, then I’m not staying with the Spiritual Breeze Village anymore,” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xue Qi smiled, “But we can’t exactly disregard our manners.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What manners,” Stone rolled his eyes. “Brother Ye Zichen isn’t someone who cares about so much. Just act like how you’re supposed to. Why are you acting like a woman… Look at me and him, we’re still the same as before!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Stone is right,” Ye Zichen nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then… alright!” Xue Qi nodded after a brief hesitated, then set his gaze upon Yellow Hair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This guy is a subordinate of mine before I ascended. Give him a place to stay!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>False Earth Immortal subordinate!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Xue Qi couldn’t help but gasp silently. </span><i><span style>Human Immortal level experts are truly different, even False Earth Immortal level experts can only be his subordinates.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Yet, just a subordinate-level person made the Zhou family have a wonderous life.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, that was already history. The situation of the Victorious Village compared to Spiritual Breeze Village was now like heaven and earth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ignoring Victorious Village, even some normal families and clans might not be in as good of a spot as Spiritual Breeze Village currently was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right now, the entire garden was filled with spiritual herbs, all of the people had earth grade spiritual reassures as weapons, and were able to cultivate any attribute they wanted. All of that made them seem like a mid to large sized family.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person who brought all that, was the ascender Xue Qi had only taken in reluctantly only as an act of kindness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Although, then I’ll settle this brother beside Brother Ye’s room. I wonder how I should address this brother?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My name is Wang Meng, but Boss and my bros all call me Yellow Hair,” Yellow Hair pointed at his yellow colored hair and chuckled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Wang!” Xue Qi answered courteously. Ye Zichen dared to call him Yellow Hair, but Xue Qi didn’t. No matter what, Wang Meng was a False Earth Immortal level expert, so Xue Qi felt like he should be more respectful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, it’s meal time,” Xue Lan walked over with a chuckle, while the Spiritual Breeze Village’s women followed behind her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she saw Ye Zichen, she immediately put down the dishes, and wrapped her arms around him, “Zichen-gege, when did you come back?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This intimate gesture caused quite a few different reactions from people. Stone and his wife both nodded with a little nod.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Xue Qi raised his eyebrows, but didn’t say anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen-gege, hurry up and sit,” Xue Lan pulled Ye Zichen and told him to sit town.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yellow Hair quickly sat down beside Ye Zichen as well, but Xue Lan glared at him with a pout, “Who are you, why are you sitting beside Zichen-gege.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wh-What’s wrong with me sitting beside Boss.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little Yellow Hair, you don’t get it. Come side beside your Big Brother Stone,” Stone patted the space beside him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yellow Hair blinked, then quickly ran over. At that moment, Xue Lan also chuckled, then sit down beside Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The meal completely stuffed Ye Zichen, mainly because Xue Lan continuously put food into his bowl, and put on an expression like “I’m going to cry if you don’t eat it”.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, Ye Zichen could only forcefully eat three large bowls of rice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, after dinner, Ye Zichen went to a place without anyone else to smoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, at that very moment, a dark figure walked out behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you have time? Let’s chat.”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Original Chapter Teaser:</strong>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p><b>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</b>We're all screwed? It can't be that serious, right?</p>
 <p><strong>Xuan-Yuan Xiang:&nbsp;</strong>Yes, we're all screwed.</p>
 <p><strong>Yellow-Hair:&nbsp;</strong>Seriously? Big sis, you're just messing with me aren't you?</p>
 <p><strong>Xuan-Yuan Xiang:&nbsp;</strong>I'm not.</p>
 <p><strong>Yellow-Hair:&nbsp;</strong>I see I see. You are the just messing with me. After all, how can a white jade pendant possibly screw us all over?</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Haha, you've got a point there.</p>
 <p><strong>Xuan-Yuan Xiang:&nbsp;</strong>No, I'm dead serious. We'll all screwed if we don't find it.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Can you tell me why?</p>
 <p><strong>Xuan-Yuan Xiang:</strong> What if I tell you an extremely strong evil-doer is sealed with in?</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>And who is that?</p>
 <p><strong>Xuan-Yuan Xiang:&nbsp;</strong>Your daughter.</p>
