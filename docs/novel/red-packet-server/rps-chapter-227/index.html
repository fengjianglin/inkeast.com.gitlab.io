 <p><span style>Chapter 227 – Do you think I have a chance at being an A-list star?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Battle of the Bag was extremely intense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sun Yige crossed her arms and bit her lips as she frowned while looking at the heated fight, “Don’t-Don’t go, it looks so dangerous.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>To be honest, Ye Zichen felt his heart jump to his throat when he saw how fiercely they fought.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Even if the male:female ratio is unbalanced, and that Sun Yige was also a girl whose looks are among the best of girls, there still isn’t a need to act like this, right?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Even if one of them gets it, was it supposed to get Sun Yige to treat them to a meal?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He knew Sun Yige’s personality very well. </span><i><span style>Don’t talk about treating them to a meal, it was unbelievable for her to even allow them to send her home.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry, just wait here for a moment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen licked his lips, then gradually moved towards the fight. If he really wanted to attack, then these people definitely won’t be able to beat him…</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, several unidentified objects flew out from the riled up crowd. Ye Zichen picked them up from the ground…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Makeup case.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Card holder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As well as the backpack strap of the bag.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems like I won’t be able to get it back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen picked up the three items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sun Yige looked at the three items, then received them with a smile, “This is enough.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The smile was very warm. It was as if her mood did not turn sour due to the case with the bag.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, you guys! If you have guts, then just wait here for laozi. Big bro, call some people over for me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Call your big bro? Heh! Captain, there is a gang fight here, I request for backup.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You two, stop pretending to be grandsons, nobody can leave today!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Several loud angry roars sounded out at the fight. Ye Zichen glanced over, then raised his eyebrows at Sun Yige, “Let’s leave first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two of them walked side-by-side on the business street. Fortunately, the day wasn’t very hot, and as the breeze blew past, it provided people with an indescribable comfort.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When one looked near the business street, they would be able to see girls carrying shopping bags everywhere, while their faces were full of happy smiles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were indeed very happy, but their wallets were sobbing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Walking with Sun Yige was definitely an honor, and something of equal importance was that she was exceptionally quiet…</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was so quiet to the point that if you don’t try to find a topic to talk about, she wouldn’t speak!</span></p>
 <p><span style>In order to make the atmosphere between the two of them less awkward, Ye Zichen pursed his lips, “Ha… Oh yeah, Class Rep, where did you go just now? How did you get your bag snatched away?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Me!?” Ye Zichen could tell from Sun Yige’s expression that she was very nervous. She bit her lips a few times, then finally replied. “I have a friend that wants to be an actress, so I went with her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Actress? Even an amateur can be one?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s just extras,” Sun Yige smiled kindly. “Starting from extras, then getting into the crew…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…” Ye Zichen didn’t know how he should reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sun Yige turned to look at him, then bit her lips, “Uhm… Thank you for just now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her voice was extremely soft. If it wasn’t for Ye Zichen’s hearing being rather good, he might not have been able to hear it clearly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need for thanks, just don’t hate me,” Ye Zichen smiled wryly. “I got the bag back just now, but then I gave it to them. If I didn’t give it to them, then your bag might not have been broken either.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No worries, it isn’t a name brand bag.” Sun Yige took it rather easily. Her face was forever accompanied by a warm smile, giving people an unusual feeling of intimacy. However, it was clearly that her holding the makeup case and card holder was very inconvenient.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Class Rep Sun, follow me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In front of a flagship store of some luxurious brands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you bring me here for?” Sun Yige stood at the entrance yet did not enter. This sort of place was not somewhere that her family would be able to afford.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course it's to buy a bag for you. I am partially responsible for your broken bag…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need for the trouble, I’ll just buy another one the next time I go to the night market,” Sun Yige shook her head like a rattle drum. Although she had never been to such a place, she could guess that the prices of the bags inside were definitely very expensive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We already came, so go in and have a look!” With that, Ye Zichen grabbed Sun Yige by her wrist and walked into the store.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir, Madam, welcome!” The clerk went up to them passionately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded towards her, “We want to have a look at some bags.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please follow me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, the clerk brought them to the area just for bags and begun to introduce all sorts of bags to them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have a look and see which one you like?” Ye Zichen tilted his head and saw that Sun Yige’s entire face was as red as an apple. She breathed quickly and her pulse raced.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can-Can you let go of me!” A hint of a tremble was mixed in Sun Yige’s voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Ye Zichen let go of his hand with a smile, and said apologetically, “Sorry, have a look, which one do you like?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sun Yige looked at the bags on the counter. All women like these, and Sun Yige was no exception.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she saw these pretty bags, her eyes gradually lit up, but when she saw the price…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So expensive.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Beauty, all bags in our shop are real from high-class brands, so the price is naturally slightly more expensive. However, since your boyfriend doesn’t care, then don’t try to help him save money!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sun Yige’s face, that had just turned slightly calmer instantly turned bright red once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s not my boyfriend,” Sun Yige answered quietly with a blush.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That clerk was stunned for a moment before she smiled softly, “If he isn’t your boyfriend, then he’s your pursuer, you’re so fortunate…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He…” It seemed like Sun Yige still wanted to explain, but at that moment, a middle-aged man in casual clothes hugging a girl around twenty years old, who was wearing beautiful clothes, walked over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Help me wrap that bag up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you, Director Wang,” the girl answered coquettishly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing the voice, Sun Yige turned her head, “Lil’ Ya!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she noticed the man beside the girl, Sun Yige’s expression changed drastically, “Li Ya, why…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yige!” The face of the girl acting coquettishly stiffened up when she saw Sun Yige.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, a hint of greed flashed across the middle-aged man’s eyes before he raised his eyebrows and smiled, “Isn’t this Miss Sun?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Director Wang,” Sun Yige nodded politely, but her gaze remained on Li Ya.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Director Wang noticed the gaze, so he put down his hand from Li Ya’s waist with a smile, “I met Lil’ Li on the road. On yeah, why didn’t you go in for the interview just now…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I never thought about being an actress, I just went with Lil’ Ya.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s a shame, with your potential as long as you slightly understand, you can definitely become popular,” As he spoke, Director Wang reached his hand towards Sun Yige in an attempt to hold her hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How about it? Join my crew, I’ll help you become an A-List star.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Director Wang reached his hand out, Ye Zichen reached out his hand to hold Director Wang’s hand with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Director Wang, do you think I have the potential to become an A-List star?”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Original Chapter Teaser:</b>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Nihao (你好)! Very warm welcome to this update of CCTV News. I'm Liu Qing in Bingcheng. We'll have a lot of stories for you, but first, we will bring you straight to the live scene of a so-called gang fight.</p>
 <p>As you can see behind me, there are a group of maniacs fighting over a handbag of the young lady over there. According to the information provided to me, this situation started when this girl's bag was robbed by a thief. In order to help the girl retain her bag, and totally not to just curry favors with the girls, many warm-hearted bystanders immediately chased after the thief. Obviously, as the main character of the story, the retard that's standing beside the girl appeared right on time, and tripped over the thief in order to regain the stolen bag. Then, like the retard he is, he decided to hand the FEMALE handbag over to the group of 'gentlemen', resulting in them then fighting among themselves to decide who would be the one to return the bag to its owner.</p>
 <p>Now... Wait, actually, there is a new development. As you can see, the retarded playboy, Ye Zichen, said something to the owner of the handbag and is preparing to join the fray! Look, he's preparing to leap in at any moment now!</p>
 <p>Wait, huh? What's that? A lipstick? Wait, a pen? Ehhhh!? Why's a handbag strap flying!?</p>
