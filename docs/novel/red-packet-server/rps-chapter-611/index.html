 <p><span style>Chapter 611 – Zuo Zhencai</span></p>
 <p><span style>The elder in the group was wearing a commoner’s hemp shirt, but that was not enough to hide his unique aura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s gaze rested on the elder, causing everyone else to glance over as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, this geezer just came, he’s called Zuo…” Yellow Hair scratched his head and pointed at the old man. “You’re Zuo what again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zuo Zhencai!” the elder replied as he bowed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah boss, he’s called Zuo Zhencai. Seriously, that name is way too lame,” Yellow Hair twitched his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen slapped him on the head and motioned for him to go away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he walked in front of the elder with a nod and a smile, “Senior, we meet again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t deserve being called Senior. You are the master of Leisure House after all,” the elder took a few steps backwards and smiled wryly. “When you went to the Demon Realm and said that you were going to save someone, I really thought you were a demon. I have offended you then, please do not take it to heart.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior, don’t say that,” Ye Zichen smiled. “When is senior going to return to the Treasure Tower? I can get someone to send you back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not anytime soon,” the elder sighed, while a hint of sadness surfaced in his blurry eyes. “I’ve stayed too long in the Demon Realm and appearing so suddenly is bad for the children. They actually didn’t even know about me being captured by the demons. What’s more, my body is really weak right now, so I would like to stay here for a few days and use the time to understand what the situation at the Treasure Tower is like. I wonder if…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stay as long as you want,” Ye Zichen quickly replied. “Zuo Mo chipped in a lot in order for me to be able to develop everything to this degree.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems like you are very close with my granddaughter. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have given you the tower head token.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Indeed, but please do not misunderstand. We are just friends,” Ye Zichen couldn’t help but explain in fear of Zuo Zhencai misunderstanding the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, Zuo Zhencai smiled meaningfully and nodded, “No worries. I’ll let you youngsters deal with your problems. Lil’ Mo is an adult now, she has her own ideas, so I’m not going to butt in.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone was completely shocked by the pair’s conversation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only Yellow Hair wasn’t too shocked. He was an natural airhead, and although he could tell from the conversation that the old man might have something to do with the Treasure Tower, he felt like Leisure House wasn’t that different from the Treasure Tower.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the other people were unable to remain as calm…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The Treasure Tower.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>That is a peak faction in the Three Realms. None of them even thought that someone from the Treasure Tower might be amongst them. If they were to think on the words more carefully, they would be able to deduce that the elder was one of the Treasure Tower’s tower head’s immediate family members.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, they had no choice but to become more mindful around the elder. At the same time, all of them begun to make up their minds about finding a chance to get closer to the elder. If they were lucky and the elder took them back to the Treasure Tower with him, then their status would rise greatly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I heard little brother Ye came back!” A loud laugh boomed out from behind everyone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they turned around, they saw Stone, who was completely topless and revealing his clear eight pack, walk over with a bright smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xue Qi also stood beside him as well as Lil’ Lan, who was making a face at Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Ye,” Xue Qi remained as calm as usual. He walked over and patted Ye Zichen on the shoulder before raising his eyebrows. “It seems like Brother Ye managed to gain a lot from the trip.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You guys are doing pretty well,” Ye Zichen shook his head with a smile. “You’ve already reached the mid stage of the Earth Immortal level. Brother Stone also broke through into the Earth Immortal level and seems to be reaching the mid-stage now. I can’t believe that our little village has changed so much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s all thanks to little brother Ye’s little girlfriend…” the moment Stone began to speak, Ye Zichen quickly clamped his mouth and dragged him backwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Ye Zichen also nodded towards Zuo Zhencai with a smile, who merely maintained his meaningful smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After they left, the middle-aged people standing around Zuo Zhencai all surrounded him, and begun to address him as Elder Zuo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, Zuo Zhencai let out a soft sigh. He didn’t tell the people here his identity because he didn’t want something like that to happen.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It seems like I won’t be able to get any peace.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Ye, why did you drag me away?” Stone complained after Ye Zichen finally released him when they arrived in a living room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xue Qi, when you have time, tell Brother Stone that he has to watch who is around when he’s speaking, and that he should also use his brain more,” Ye Zichen shrugged speechlessly. </span><i><span style>Stone’s words never go through his brain. It was one thing normally, but that was Zuo Mo’s grandfather…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Ol’ Xue…” Stone said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even Brother Ye scolded you, so you really should change your habit,” Xue Qi rolled his eyes. “How many times did I tell you to watch it? You just refused to listen. Think about it, that expert from before left in anger because of </span><i><span style>your</span></i><span style> words.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, don’t mention him. He pisses me off,” Stone couldn’t help but snort. “He wants to join us, but instead chose to put on some airs. Act arrogantly my ass, I hate what he’s like. So what if I cursed him. He wanted an elder position? Tsk… Is he even worthy!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s Stone talking about…” Ye Zichen blinked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m going to wash some fruit for you,” Xue Lan ran away from the room with a giggle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Xue Qi replied, “You have seen it already. The Leisure House has been established. Since we have Lady Zuo Mo’s support, our resources have surpassed the Six Pavilions and Three Gates, naturally causing there to be many people who want to join us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm,” Ye ZIchen nodded, then sighed silently in his mind.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>In the end, we still ended up using Zuo Mo’s resources to support us. If this continues, then the Treasure Tower and Leisure House will only become more entwined.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s one thing if it’s just Zuo Mo, but the other members of her clan…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I guess I have to find some time to stop receiving Zuo Mo’s resources. Since we’re established a faction now, it’s better to rely on ourselves.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Xue Qi also spoke up once more, “A mid stage Sky Immortal expert came over. That sort of expert is a peak force to be reckoned with in the entire Three Realms, so we naturally welcomed him. But that expert’s requests were rather high…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph, high!? It was outrageous!” Stone snorted. “A million celeste per month and we have to provide him with resources for his cultivation breakthrough. What’s more, we can’t order him to do anything and he does whatever he wants. Tsk, he wanted everything without doing any work.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The more Stone said, the angrier he got. In the end, he even swung his fist as if he was punching that old man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even so, you can’t just curse him outright. He has already said that he’ll come back and get even sooner or later. It’s one thing if it was just empty talk, but what if he really comes?” Xue Qi frowned as he lectured Stone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, there’s no way that he dares,” Stone laughed, then wrapped his arm around Ye Zichen’s shoulder. “Also, my little brother Ye’s back!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment, raging winds swept throughout the courtyard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, a sinister elder in a white robe appeared in the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who said that I don’t dare to return!?”</span></p>
