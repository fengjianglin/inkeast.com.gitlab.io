 <p><span style>Chapter 73 – Yue Lao buys cigarettes</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Repaying with my body is no good, just change your conditions…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Officer Lin blushed. At this moment, the door to the ward was pushed open.</span></p>
 <p><span style> “Lil’ Yue, I’ve been looking for you for a long time. So you were here,” The person who spoke was a rather handsome man in police uniform.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is the person that saved you, right?” The man walked over and reached his hand out towards Ye Zichen with a smile. “Hello, I’m Zhao Ziming, Lil’ Yue’s boyfriend.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows, and looked at Officer Lin’s expression, before reaching his hand out towards Zhao Ziming, “Ye Zichen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment they shook hands, Ye Zichen felt a powerful force from his hands that yanked his arm outwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A tremendous pain instantly passed out from the wound on his shoulder. Ye Zichen knitted his eyebrows firmly together without saying anything. However, he begun to look towards Zhao Ziming with hints of confusion in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This man wasn’t as bright of a man as he seemed to be.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“No wonder Officer Lin can’t repay me with her body, so she has a boyfriend,” Ye Zichen intentionally mentioned the issue of repaying him with her body when he retracted his hands. As he expected, the moment Zhao Ziming heard this, his expression grew dark, but he hid it very well, so Officer Lin did not notice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ziming, Ye Zichen is like this, he likes to joke around,” Officer Lin explained, perhaps due to being worried that Zhao Ziming would think too much into it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao Ziming’s face continued to show a warm smile as he reached out his hand to rub Officer Lin’s hair, “Am I that petty of a person? Lil’ Yue, you are wounded and your savior needs to rest. Let’s go back to your ward.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Officer Lin nodded slightly, then smiled towards Ye Zichen, “Ye Zichen, I’m leaving.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right before Officer Lin and Zhao Ziming left his ward, Ye Zichen suddenly called out to her, “Officer Lin, at least tell me your name.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lin Xiyue.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the two of them left the ward, Ye Zichen finally looked down onto his shoulder. The wound that was quickly healing had been ripped apart once again due to Zhao Ziming’s yank.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The snow-white bandage already had traces of blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn’t I tell you not to move around so much. Why aren’t you listening? Do you think that I would harm you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sat on a chair in Huang Shengmei’s office as he listened to her blabber on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Would you believe me if I say that I didn’t do it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you think I would believe it?” Huang Shengmei rolled her beautiful eyes and picked up a scissor from the table and tied a knot with the bandage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, be careful from now on. It won’t be any good for you if it keeps on ripping like this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I understand,” Ye Zichen helplessly twitched his mouth. Just as he stood up and was about to leave, Huang Shengmei stopped him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stopped, then tilted his head as he looked towards Huang Shengmei in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Shengmei walked in front of him with her phone in her hand and pointed at the photo on the phone, “Is this you on there?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen glanced over at the photo. The photo was of the corridor outside Elder Su’s emergency room. As for the person in the photo, that was indeed him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What about it?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Shengmei bit her lips and replied, “Just say whether it is you on the photo.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is,” Ye Zichen replied without even thinking about it. There was nothing to deny about it. There were plenty of doctors nearby at the time, if Huang Shengmei really wanted to know, she can just grab anyone of them to point him out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Shengmei did not react when she heard his reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen waved his hands in front of her, then said, “Anything else? If there isn’t, then I’ll be leaving.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she still didn’t react. Thus, Ye Zichen left the office with pursed lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Shengmei only picked up her phone to look at the photo after he closed the door, while Ye Zichen’s reply echoed in her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How is that possible!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Shengmei scratched her hair, causing it to turn into a mess.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her friend had sent her the photo, telling her that the person in the photo had even saved someone that Professor Deng Cheng couldn’t save.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She instantly treated this man as her god when she heard the news.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had always fantasized about when she would be able to meet her god, until she met her patient, Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter how she looked at it, she felt like Ye Zichen was the person in the photo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, she felt like she was going crazy. She only went to ask Ye Zichen in order to deny her thoughts.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>However…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>He answered yes!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>No matter what, she just could not link the two together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Ye Zichen she knows and the god in the photo…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Shengmei felt like she was really going crazy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From Ye Zichen’s point of view, getting injured wasn’t bad. At least he can blatantly skip lessons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen hummed as he wandered around the hospital garden when his phone started to ring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: Daoist friend.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What did this geezer come to find him for?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen replied as he leaned on the willow tree underneath the hospital building.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: Daoist friend, you weren’t really right.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: What happened?</span></p>
 <p><span style>This made Ye Zichen rather confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: You sent five boxes of cigarettes to Old Lord Taishang, he just came to show off at my place and even gave me one. After smoking it, I feel like he cigarette you gave him was higher-class than the ones you gave me.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ugh.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>So it was about that.</span></i><span style> Ye Zichen was wondering just what the hell it was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Old Lord Taishang exchanged a Nine Reincarnation Soul Pill with me. Yue Lao, if you want higher-class cigarettes, then you can use things to exchange for it as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: Sure, daoist friend, just say what you want.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao actually agreed so easily. It seemed like those two geezers in the Heavenly Court got into a competition.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A competition is good, there was no harm and all benefits for Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What should he ask for,</span></i><span style> this was something he had to think about.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What Yue Lao could do merely seemed to be helping people tie strings together for relationships.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had enough women around him, there was no need for Yue Lao to tie him up with anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, Ye Zichen thought of the new function, the Treasure Shop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: I want cultivation experience.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: About this… Daoist friend, you know that cultivation experience is very important to us deities.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Is cultivation experience more important, or is face more important? What’s more, are my cigarettes not rare things?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao fell into silence. It seemed like he was having an internal struggle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a long while, Yue Lao finally replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: What’s the rate?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: 500 cultivation experience for a box of Zhonghua, 220 cultivation experience for a box of Yuxi. Choose.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lai: Give me 10 boxes of Zhonghua.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Hehe, pay first, then the items will be delivered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao immediately sent a red packet over without saying anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received Yue Lao’s red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cultivation experience x5000.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was extremely proud as he looked at the 5000 cultivation experience he just earned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He already had 8000 cultivation experience when he added it with the 3000 cultivation experience from before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was a step closer to the Secret Scriptures of the Fiery Eyes of Truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen placed the cultivation experience into his celestial plate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“One moment, I’ll immediately send you the goods.”</span></p>
