 <p><span style>Chapter 720 – Condition</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Run!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I’ll still have a second chance as long as I’m alive.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Who cares about taking over the Three Realms or your king returning!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>All of Black Dragon’s ambitions seemed to turn into smoke as he understood the new situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fact that the Master of the Laws knew Ye Zichen meant that whatever trump card Black Dragon had with him was now useless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The primordial dragon was a clear example of that. Although the dragon was someone who could even match a Ruler, his strength was forcefully limited to the Immortal King level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had no idea whether she had other moves she might be able to use against him. If he was to continue staying around…</span></p>
 <p><span style>His mind told him that it was a terrible idea.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Now!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon thought no longer. He turned and sprinted towards the outside of the valley.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lorie immediately chased after Black Dragon with a giggle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who was chatting with Lin Ru, also indicated towards the direction Black Dragon fled in. “That guy is a demon. You should know them, right? They’re bad guys!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah,” Lin Ru nodded expressionlessly without doing anything else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who had hoped to ask Lin Ru to capture Black Dragon so he could slack off a bit, couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows when he saw Lin Ru not make a move, “What are you just standing around for? Capture him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And why should I join in the argument?” Lin Ru tilted her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, don’t be so terrible. Weren’t we friends back then? C’mon, hurry up and don’t throw a tantrum. Just catch him,” replied Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whatever,” Lin Ru rolled her eyes, then rose into the air on a patch of clouds. “I am the Master of the Laws here, I will only do things that fulfill the responsibilities of my job. Forgive me for being unable to join in your bickering.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Seriously, you…” Ye Zichen couldn’t help but retort. “Can you really not help us out?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can’t!” Lin Ru refused resolutely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why didn’t you say so earlier? He ran really far now. Move aside and don’t get in my way,” Ye Zichen’s expression turned for the worse when he realized that Lin Ru wasn’t going to help. However, he could do nothing except run in the direction Black Dragon fled in.</span></p>
 <p><span style> Lin Ru was momentarily shocked by the sudden change in Ye Zichen’s tone, but she couldn’t help but smile, “He really is still the same.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Run? Where are you going to run now?” Ye Zichen slowly descended from the sky as he looked down at Black Dragon, who was trapped by Fatty Yin and Lorie; as well as the demon sovereigns and treacherous immortals squatting by the wall of the valley.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good job,” that was clearly directed at Fatty Yin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty Yin smiled proudly, then glared at the demon sovereigns cowering by the valley wall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All the demon sovereigns lowered their heads subconsciously, clearly indicating the kind of horrors they were forced through.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon was also very shocked by the turn of events.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He knew that he wouldn’t be able to escape by himself, so he had to rendezvous with his subordinates, only to discover his subordinates in this state.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I had absolute advantage in terms of numbers, why were they unable to do anything to the fatty who had no spiritual energy left before?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But… That’s not something for me to consider now. It’s time for negotiations to begin!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon took a deep breath, then glanced towards Ye Zichen with an indifferent frown, “Ye Zichen, I have lost this time. Tell me your conditions.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not going to try and resist?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s no need for that,” said Black Dragon. “I underestimated you. I didn’t expect you to grow so quickly. I could mess with you like I could a mere insect back then, but you have actually reached such heights now. I do not have complete confidence when facing you. What’s more, since you have the little girl and the formation master aiding you, I have no reason to even try and resist.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The straightforward answer did catch Ye Zichen slightly off guard, but it was understandable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tell me your conditions,” said Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Conditions?” Ye Zichen pursed his lip and swept his gaze over the demons and those traitors to the Three Realms. He would never forget the day the demons attacked, he would never forget the frantic feelings of the outer areas of the Immortal Region; nor Great Emperor Yonghe…</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was </span><i><span style>that </span></i><span style>person’s betrayal that led to countless deaths of the normal civilians.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Conditions?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>How could this vendetta pass with mere conditions?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I believe we can definitely come to an agreement,” Black Dragon interrupted Ye Ziche, then pointed at Great Emperor Yonghe. “You want him, right? I can hand him over. Actually, just think about it. We demons don’t actually have any actual grudge with you guys. Ever since we arrived, we did not pillage or raid. We were merely staying quietly in the cities.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is really unlike you,” Ye Zichen couldn’t help but snicker when he heard Black Dragon’s desperation. “Did the great marshal of the demons forget his ambitions? You are now throwing away pieces to save yourself? That’s totally unlike you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have no other choice,” Black Dragon did not waver. He knew that he was in the disadvantageous position.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey Yonghe, you hear that? Your new master wants to discard you already,” Ye Zichen chuckled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yonghe only looked up with a single glance, then looked back down again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He showed no discontent, nor did he curse in rage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He understood very well that was the risk he took back then. When he chose to work with the demons for his selfish gains, then he would have to burden the risk of the demons losing and him being discarded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he never expected everything to happen so suddenly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Feeling like your world has been turned upside down? The Three Realms you placed no faith in is actually making the </span><i><span style>oh so terrifying</span></i><span style> demons tremble in fear,” Ye Zichen continued to mock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yonghe, who tried not to show any emotions, couldn’t help but smile wryly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Indeed, he did not expect this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Three Realms he had no faith in actually turned the tables, it was all thanks to the reincarnation of the Yellow Emperor, who he held even less faith in!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, if you can let us demons go, then I can hand over every single one of your people who betrayed you and give you enough resources until you are satisfied. What’s more, I can also promise to not invade within ten thousand years… No, I can promise to never invade the Three Realms!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That sounds rather tempting,” Ye Zichen chuckled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon’s expression darkened. Sounds rather t</span><i><span style>empting. That means he isn’t satisfied yet.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what do want?” Black Dragon roared. “Don’t be too greedy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As expected of the demon marshal. You are actually able to make threats even now,” Ye Zichen squinted his eyes and snapped his fingers. “Resources, invasion… Say, if I take care of you all here, then aren’t all the resources mine anyway? And you will never invade ever again? No matter how I look at it, that seems like the best option. Am I not correct?”</span></p>

 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>I know.</p>
 <p><strong>Lin Ru:&nbsp;</strong>Then?</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Do me a favor and help me catch him?</p>
 <p><strong>Lin Ru:&nbsp;</strong>No.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>What? Why? They're the bad guys, you should know that, right?</p>
 <p><strong>Lin Ru:&nbsp;</strong>I cannot choose to interfere with any matters except those concerning people who have broken the Laws. He did not.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Shit, you should have said that earlier</p>
