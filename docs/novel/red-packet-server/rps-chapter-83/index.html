 <p><span style>Chapter 83 – Su Yan’s affability level level up</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Su Yan, you must tell her that she’s sick the next time you meet her,” Ye Zichen pointed towards the fleeing Beetle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan pulled his arm, “Alright now, stop getting mad at her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How am I getting mad at her?” Ye Zichen shook his head and sigh. “She really is ill.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A hint of confusion flashed across Su Yan’s eyes, but thinking about how Ye Zichen had saved her grandfather, he might really have noticed something.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What illness?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mental illness!” Ye Zichen said with certainly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan couldn’t help but giggle, then raised her hand to hammer him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t talk about her like that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hahaha, that girl is too cocky. What does her family do? She dares to speak to arrogantly to you, she can’t be a powerful third generation of the capital, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen teased Su Yan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan giggled and shook her head, “No, she was my classmate in high school, her family conditions are pretty good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then she actually dared to speak like that to you? She is truly crazy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was shocked. </span><i><span style>Just what was Su Yan’s identity!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Her dad was a colonel and her grandfather was a chief.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>A true powerful third generation.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, Su Qilong was also a major businessman. Despite all of her family background, Gao Chang still dared to speak like that to Su Yan.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Either she’s ignorant, or she’s crazy.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“She doesn’t know about my situation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan chuckled. Hearing that, Ye Zichen immediately understood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t a surprise for the other person not to know with Su Yan’s personality of keeping a low profile, but then he suddenly thought of that Young Master Bai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s Young Master Bai’s relationship with you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Normal classmates, he did pursue me in high school,” Su Yan pursed her lips, then quickly explained. “He really is just a normal classmate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, I believe you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen caressed her hair, causing Su Yan to blush. She enjoyed the feeling of being with Ye Zichen a lot, especially since she could faintly feel that his position in her heart could not be replaced.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she was still a bit resistant towards it in her subconscious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason was Xia Keke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As best friends, she was very clear about Xia Keke having feelings for Ye Zichen as well. She didn’t want to fight over him with her, but she didn’t want to give up either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, I have something to ask you,” Su Yan bit her lips and asked. “Do you know that Keke likes you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was a bit confused when he saw Su Yan’s serious expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was too sudden, she didn’t give him a chance to react at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most importantly, he didn’t think that Su Yan would ask him so bluntly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their affability level was 499, there was a possibility of the string snapping once again as long as it didn’t reach 500.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He could tell from there that his answer was of utmost importance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen chose to speak the truth after endless struggling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment he finished, he was prepared to receive the news of the marriage string snapping.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But…</span></p>
 <p><span style>There wasn’t!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The marriage string did not snap.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Phew.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen let out a long sigh, it was so close just now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He raised his head to take a peek at Su Yan and saw that she was not affected by the answer at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>More importantly, she spoke up once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then do you know that I like you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then do you like me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I do.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In that instant, a smiled that would put hundreds of flowers to shame bloomed on Su Yan’s face as she leapt into Ye Zichen’s arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your affability level with Su Yan increased by 1. Current affability level: 500.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Affability level levelled up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Current lover status confirmed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s heart shook upon receiving these messages.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It levelled up just like that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The 1 point of affability level actually increased through these questions!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan held Ye Zichen tightly and laid her head against his chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had suppressed it for so long.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the moment that he made the bet with her father for her, his figure was scorched deeply into her heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she kept on worrying about Xia Keke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She felt like she was going mad.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Until he said that he likes her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She felt that it didn’t matter anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter who likes her, no matter who else was by his side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was enough as long as he liked her, and as long as there was a position for her in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a long while, Su Yan broke free from Ye Zichen’s arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m telling you, don’t get too full of yourself, I will only… because Keke is my best friend… If you dare to bully me in the future, then I’ll get my older brother to beat you up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes ma’am.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen returned to the hospital with Su Yan and saw that a terrible expression on the face of Ye Rong, who was sitting in the ward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mom.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where did you run off to now. Can you just stay peacefully in the hospital?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stuttered without saying a word. However, at that very moment, Mother Ye noticed the hands of Su Yan and Ye Zichen holding each other tightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This girl…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hello Auntie, I’m Zichen’s classmate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan said with a blush, while her heart beat like a fawn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Ye Zichen knew that there was nothing to hide from Ye Rong’s expression. He directly nodded, “Mom, didn’t you want to see your daughter-in-law? Here she is.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan yanked Ye Zichen’s arm, while her face was completely red.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The smile on Mother Ye’s face became even brighter when she heard him say “daughter-in-law”. She quickly went up to Su Yan, then scolded Ye Zichen, “Hurry up and get your bandages changed at Doctor Huang’s. Doctor Huang came many times already.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at Su Yan with a glance telling her to not worry, then left the ward. However, when he arrived at Huang Shengmei’s office, he felt rather troubled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two of them had a marriage string.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But he didn’t know how it appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stood in front of the office entrance for a long time without entering, while he hesitated. Yet, at that moment, the office door was opened from within.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey Doctor Huang.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen entered Doctor Huang’s office.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The body of Ye Zichen, who had taken a Body Enhancing Pill, was far better than that of normal people’s. Even though it was a gunshot wound, it had more or less healed after several days of rest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Shengmei said softly after tying up Ye Zichen’s bandages, “You recovered pretty well, you should go and get discharged.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Oh.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen didn’t expect that Huang Shengmei’s tone was more or less the same as before. However, then he thought about it and understood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The affability level on their marriage string was merely 10.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was essentially the same as it being nonexistent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you for Doctor Huang’s care.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re too courteous, but when can you save my little brother?” Huang Shengmei looked up. Her little brother was still the most important in her heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’ll have to wait a bit more.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How long?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll find you when it’s time,” Ye Zichen said vaguely. He didn’t know how long he needed to store that much qi either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay,” Huang Shengmei smiled. She glanced over Ye Zichen’s body with her beautiful eyes, then bit her lips. “Err, you have a girl…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Huang Shengmei spoke, Ye Zichen’s phone sounded out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait a moment.”</span></p>
