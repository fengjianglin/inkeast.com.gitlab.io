 <p><span style>Chapter 593 – The Elder in the Prison</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This geezer…” Ye Zichen couldn’t help but shake his head with a smile when he noticed that Old Lord Taishang did not reply anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but smile when he saw that Old Lord Taishang no longer replied.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It seems like the pill refinement manual is extremely important to him, so he is rather reluctant to give it up.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen merely shook his head, but did not retort.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I did get the Beast Fire, but it won’t be mine much longer.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Since that’s the case, it doesn’t matter even if I don’t get the pill refinement manual.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Ye Zichen began to go on a shopping spree in the Treasure Shop, leveling his Fiery Eyes of Truth, Seventy-Two Transformations, Body-Freezing Technique, Unbreakable Body etc. to level 3.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He also purchased plenty of spiritual sigils. He had no idea whether they’ll be useful for him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>But I still have to be ready just in case!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen took a look at the pills and sigils in the Treasure Chest, then at the secret scriptures that the system notification informed him that he already studied, Ye Zichen stood up from the ground and slowly walked towards the portal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Ye,” said Yuan Hong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tell Liu’er-jie that I’ll definitely bring back Su Yan safe and sound,” with that, Ye Zichen stepped into the portal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Liu’er shot through the air the moment he entered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where did Ye Zichen go!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He just went in, he also said that he’ll definitely bring lil’ sis back safe and sound. Sis, this portal…” Su Zhu looked at Su Liu’er in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Fatty Yin urgently descended from the sky. Then, he couldn’t help but frown as he watch the portal begin to disappear, “I’m late!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, he took out a phone and sent a message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen already went over to the Demon Realm. I didn’t make it. Time for Plan B!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Purple mist swirled in the area. The place where Ye Zichen exited the portal was gate at the foot of a mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The mountain itself reached into the mountains, and Ye Zichen could see that there were plenty of muscular humanoids with pupil-less black eyes patrolling around with bats in their hands.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Transform!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Buzz…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had called out silently in his heart, then turned into a little mosquito which then flew up the mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Ye Zichen had anticipated, pretty much every single level of the mountains was heavily guarded. </span><i><span style>From the looks of it, Gu Li wants me to slowly fight my way up, but he could never possibly imagine that I know the Seventy-Two Transformations.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It was the first time Ye Zichen had come to the Demon Realm, and he paid attention to the strength of the guards as he flew up.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>They truly are strong.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, after flying for so long, he still didn’t see a single expert below the Human Immortal level.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Since this is the Demon Realm, I wonder where Yumei is. It’d be great if she’s with Su Yan, then I can save them both together. </span></i><span style>Ye Zichen murmured silently as he neared the apex of the mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two ten-meter-tall humanoids stood at the top of the mountain, and guarded a jail-like building in a way befitting a gate guardian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mosquito? Why’s there a mosquito here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>One of them clapped towards Ye Zichen with both his hands evoking a huge gust of wind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, Ye Zichen hurried dodged to the side, then snuck in through a crack in the prison gate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It escaped.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So be it. A mosquito can let the girls inside feel the passion of our Demon Realm mosquitos,” the other humanoid laughed. “I just wonder what Lord Gu is thinking, why did he capture human women.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shh, don’t talk about Lord Gu Li in private. Did you forget about those guys…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man’s face lost all its color and gradually turned stark white.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>How could I forget? It was just last month when a thousand demon elites were all killed due to disobeying Gu Li’s orders.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s just guard this place properly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Ye Zichen entered the jail, he intentionally transformed into an insect that caused less vibrations in the air in order to prevent himself from catching other people’s attention, while he searched for Su Yan inside the jail.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were plenty of people inside the prison’s many cells, and Ye Zichen could tell that none of them were demons, yet none of them were people from the Three Realms either.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wait, no, there’s one over there.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen flapped his wings and flew over towards the cell. The one in the cell was an old man with cuffs around his hands and legs. What’s more, he was also locked by the neck and essentially pinned to the wall in a pitiful state.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior, senior…” Ye Zichen called out to the man. The man lifted his head and struggled to open his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he saw the insect in front of him, he was momentarily stunned before asking, “You are talking to this old man?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, senior. It’s me,” Ye Zichen flew up and down. “You look like someone from our Immortal Region. Why are you here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Immortal Region. You are someone from the Immortal Region!?” Clear excitement &nbsp;flickered in the elder’s eyes, and the chains around him also rattled as he tried to move. Yet, not long later, he began to laugh coldly. “Heh, demon scum, you still want to trick this old man? I’m telling you, the Treasure Tower will not be your cohorts!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The elder struggled intensely as if he wanted to eat Ye Zichen alive.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>But what he said just now…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Treasure Tower!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>This old man is from the Treasure Tower!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I might not be able to prove my identity if he was from any other place, but proving my identity to someone from the Treasure Tower is all too simple. </span></i><span style>Ye Zichen flew out to see where the prison guards were, then quickly transformed back into a human to withdraw the Tower Head Token from his phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior, look…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You think I’m going to look just because you told me to… The Treasure Tower’s Tower Head Token!? You damned demons, you actually dared to make a move against this old man’s clan!?” The elder struggled even more intensely, causing his wrists, ankles and even collarbone to begin to bleed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen quickly pushed him down, and chucked a pill into his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, you can’t stand it anymore? You’re finally going to kill this old man? Demons, this old man will not yield even as a ghost!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>God knows what this old man has been through here, but it looks like he already made up his mind that I’m a demon.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen could only shake his head helplessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment, a prison guard ran over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop acting insane. If you continue to do so, then I’ll whip you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, the prison guard left with a snort.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who had transformed into a brick, let out a sigh. </span><i><span style>That scared me to death, that prison guard came way too suddenly.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, aren’t you together? Why are you still pretending in front of him? Or were you sent by another demonic faction?” the elder smiled mockingly. “Demons, stop trying to waste your efforts on this old man. I will not collude with you. It’s just death, nothing special!”</span></p>
