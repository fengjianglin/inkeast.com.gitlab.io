 <p><span style>Chapter 45 – Su Yan’s string is linked again</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s the price!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen blurted out without thinking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Man Su smiled and wiped his mouth with his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you still have more of the wine…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slam.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately threw a green gourd onto the table. Old Man Su was stunned for a long while, and looked meaningfully at Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He raised his eyebrows slightly, then soundlessly suppressed his shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as he had thought, </span><i><span style>that brat is not normal.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Perhaps, he might really be someone from there.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Ye Zichen took out the green gourd, he also felt that he was being a bit impulsive. He had directly withdrawn the monkey wine from the WeChat’s Treasure Chest. He did not carry any on him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The old man must have been shocked when he saw me suddenly take it out, right?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Secretly he sneaked a glance over at Old Man Su, the old man was touching the gourd extremely lovingly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I probably wasn’t found out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen felt rather lucky. Meanwhile, since the old man was also a person that kept his word, he picked up his phone and dialed Su Yan’s number.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Approximately twenty minutes later, a beautiful figured appeared underneath the bright road lights.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Su Yan arrived, she would occasionally look behind her, as if she was staying vigilant to see whether there was anyone following her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she appeared beside Old Man Su, she smiled wryly with a helpless expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandpa, why did you sneak out to eat again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandpa just like these things, it’s not like you don’t already know,” Old Man Su rubbed his beard and laughed. Su Yan sighed and sat opposite the old man, then said. “If dad finds out, he’ll beat me to death.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Does he dare!”</span></p>
 <p><span style> The old man glared, causing a mighty aura to flow outwards subconsciously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s your father, and he’s just my son in front of me! If he dares to hit my darling granddaughter, I’ll skin him alive.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan also laughed. At that moment, the green gourd fell into her sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For some reason, Su Yan frowned slightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandpa…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You noticed,” Old Man Su held the gourd in his hands and chuckled. Then he took off the cork and poured a mouthful into his mouth. “This is good wine. Seeing this gourd, you probably know who came to find you, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How did you end up with him again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan frowned, bit her lips, then stood up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, Old Man Su quickly shouted towards behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Ye, hurry up and come out. My granddaughter’s going to run away soon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Ye Zichen finally walked out from a dark corner near the barbeque store.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His face was covered with an awkward smile as he waved towards Su Yan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Su Yan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan glared at him fiercely. The scene of Xia Keke kissing him was still fresh in her mind. Thus, she turned around and walked outside, while ignoring him. Ye Zichen quickly caught up and grabbed her arm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan swept her gaze towards the place where the two of them touched. Ye Zichen quickly retracted his hand and rubbed his arm anxiously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Su Yan, I didn’t do it on purpose.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan’s gaze was filled with coldness. It was a bone-piercing coldness that worried Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think that there’s been some misunderstandings between us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen hesitated for a moment, then decided to tell everything to Su Yan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t that easy to bump into Old Man Su. Bumping into him this time was pure chance. If he didn’t explain this time, then god only knows when he would have to wait until the two of them can settle their differences.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The differences might even turn harder and harder to settle as time passes. Then, he might really have no chance with the goddess.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t think that there’s any misunderstanding between us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan did not give any face for Ye Zichen, but her actions sold out her thoughts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She didn’t leave!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This meant that she wanted to hear Ye Zichen’s explanation. Otherwise, everything would end if she just directly had turned around and got in a taxi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is your girlfriend? So pretty! How did you make her angry? Did you cheat on her?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing teased in midair. Ye Zichen frowned, and shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shut up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re telling me to shut up? Fine! I’ll shut up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan was shocked by Ye Zichen, so she turned around and left without saying anyting else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t, Su Yan, I wasn’t talking about you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Man Su smiled kindly and gazed at Ye Zichen and Su Yan act like they were flirting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He took a sip of the monkey wine and exclaimed softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young people are lively.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Speaking of which, Ye Zichen finally stopped Su Yan, but she didn’t look at him with a nice expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan raised her delicate chin and hugged her shoulders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’ll give you a minute…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>One minute!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This wasn’t a lot of time. He definitely wouldn’t have time to finish telling the situation from start to finish.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fifty seconds left.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn’t start yet!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Forty-five seconds!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop hurrying me. Let me organize everything!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen took a deep breath and calmed down his complicated mood down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The situation at the police station as like this. The scene you saw of Xia Keke kissing me was fake. Why did she kiss me? It was mainly…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen blabbered on a lot, without even taking a single breath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After speaking about the entire situation, Ye Zichen put his hands beside his legs like a primary school student, while he waited for Su Yan to react.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s more that… You haven’t talked about.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan raised her eyebrows, causing Ye Zichen to scratch his head and fall into deep thoughts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There wasn’t anything else that he had to say?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Give me some hints?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It just happened!” Su Yan said in an unfriendly tone. Ye Zichen immediately understood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re talking about what happened at the dorms. That was also a misunderstanding...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blabber, blabber.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately spoke up honestly. When he finished, Su Yan hugged her shoulders and laughed coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So romantic, a world shattering anger for a woman…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Su Yan, you have to believe me! Helping Xia Keke was purely due to you. As for Li Jiayi, it was purely a coincidence. She was my classmate. What’s more, I didn’t do anything to her!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t have that much face.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan twitched her mouth, but felt a sweetness in her heart.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Due to her!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, thinking about this guy’s recent behavior, she still wasn’t going to be nice to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After so long, he actually did not try to send any message to her on WeChat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t even look for her after she deleted him!</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she did misunderstand about him and Xia Keke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Marriage string received.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Possessor: Ye Zizhen, Possessed: Su Yan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Current affability level: 50.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It was even higher than it was before!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s eyebrows raised up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Su Yan, you’re not angry anymore?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that Su Yan’s expression improved, and that the marriage string improved, Ye Zichen asked in a testing manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan lowered her gaze, and looked at him in a judging manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you sure that you didn’t touch Li Jiayi? How did you solve…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s not quite convenient for me to tell.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m saying tell!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan frowned once again. He actually dared to hide it from her, he was simply too much!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then come over, I’ll tell you in secret.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen indicated for Su Yan to come over, while Su Yan turned her ear towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Very soon, Su Yan’s face turned completely red. She raised her hand and hit Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Scoundrel…”</span></p>
