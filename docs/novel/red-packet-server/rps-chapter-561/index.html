 <p><span style>Chapter 561 – Those who think too highly of themselves will not prevail</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sire…” Xue Lian smiled wryly as she looked at the group of people behind Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their territory wasn’t so big. When it was just the our group prior, it was already a bit cramped, and now that another group came…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s a bit too many people isn’t it?” Ye Zichen smiled wryly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xue Lian bit her lips, “Don’t worry, I’ll just tell my tribesmen to squeeze a bit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What for? The manor opposite the village’s quite nice,” Jail King pointed at the manor and raised his eyebrows. “I had my eyes on that manor for a long time, let’s just snatch that over as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smacked his fist against his palm.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Oh yeah!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but nod with a smile, “Jail King is right. Let’s just snatch that away.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of them ran to the manor opposite the village. When they arrived, they saw the Emerald Cat Clan run out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sires, we were threatened, we’re leaving right now…” All of the Emerald Cat Clansmen nodded with coy smiles, then before Ye Zichen and co. entered, the one in the lead waved his hand towards his clansmen and they all departed from the manor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“See? Now we have enough space, right? Take your pick. I’m knackered after that fight, so I’m going to rest,” Jail King selected a room and ran over to it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled, and said to the others, “Everyone, do as you please.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He walked over to the pavilion in the center of the manor. </span><i><span style>I didn’t expect Bian Tianrui to have such elegance. His design of the manor is quite good.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But we took over it before he even stayed for too long. I wonder if he would cough up blood if he finds out.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Ye, why did you guys come over?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ruan Qingtian walked in from outside with a chuckle, while a expressionless man holding a celestial sword stood behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That person was Third Fatty Jin’s senior brother!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I wanted to look for you. Why didn’t I see you just now?” Ye Zichen frowned. </span><i><span style>If Ruan Qingtian had been there, then the situation might not have turned so dire.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As the Pavilion Head of the Azure Sky Pavilion, he definitely had many abilities that would turn that mustered-up army into not that much of a threat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I…” Ruan Qingtian glanced at the man behind him stealthily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Third Fatty Jin walked over. When he saw his senior brother, he immediately frowned, “Senior Brother, where did you go off to just now? Your junior brother nearly got killed!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Unskilled, and worse than others. It’s not my fault!” The man continued to remain cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>Meanwhile, Third Fatty Jin smiled coyly, then introduced him to Ye Zichen. “Boss Ye, this is my Senior Brother, Bi Shengtian<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>, he is the disciple my esteemed master is most proud of. He is of the early stage of the Sky Immortal level!”</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, he turned to Bi Shengtian in an attempt to introduce Ye Zichen, only to be mercilessly interrupted, “No need to introduce him to me. I have no need to know him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ruan Qingtian smiled and took a few steps to the side when he saw Bi Shengtian’s arrogant look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Fatty Jin looked at Ye Zichen and his senior brother for a few moments, then walked away as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, so cocky,” Ye Zichen chuckled, but did not stand up from his chair. Instead, he crossed his legs and snorted. “but to be honest, I don’t want to know you either. Since we aren’t friends, then please.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bi Shengtian turned around indifferently to pick a room, but Ye Zichen stopped him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?” Bi Shengtian frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pointed at the door, “Your way is that way.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? Did you think that you can stay on my turf even though you acted so arrogantly with me?” Ye Zichen smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bi Shengtian laughed in disdain, “No problem, I don’t want to be with beastmen either!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Youngster, say what you just said once again!? Beastmen!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian and Jail King walked out together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bi Shengtian’s expression turned dark, “Heh, and the Heavenly Court’s trash…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The f*ck, grandson, you’re damn cocky!” Yang Jian raised his eyebrows and walked forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bi Shengtian immediately moved. He raised his hand and drew his sword, then pointed the tip at Yang Jian’s throat… “I’ll kill you if you move anymore!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior Brother,” Third Fatty Jin was in the most awkward position. He was on good terms with Ye Zichen, but Bi Shengtian was his Senior Brother.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Who am I supposed to help if they really end up fighting?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Kiddo, you’re just a little strong. You won’t live long if you continue to be so cocky,” Wei Chen walked back into the manor with a fruit in his hand. He leaned onto the arch and raised his eyebrows, then flicked his fingers towards Bi Shengtian’s blade.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A wave of air directly flicked Bi Shengtian’s sword to the side. He looked over at Wei Chen in surprise…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmph!” He sheathed his sword, then left the manor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This grandson is so cocky, I want to slap him to death so much!” Yang Jian raised his eyebrows and said angrily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but tease him, “The tip of his sword reached your neck just now. You really want to teach him a lesson?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This Bi Shengtian is seriously strong. He actually managed to reach Yang Jian’s weak point as an early stage Sky Immortal without Yang Jian being able to react at all.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It seems like the Immortal Region is able to oppose the Heavenly Court and Underworld due to their actual strength!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Ye, all you other bosses, don’t get angry,” Third Fatty Jin walked over with a wry smile. “My Senior Brother has never left the sacred land of the Immortal Region. He has been taught that everyone from outside the Immortal Region are all his enemies, don’t mind it so much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little fatty, aren’t you from the Immortal Region as well? Why aren’t you like him?” said Jail King.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn’t I follow Boss Ye for a while? What’s more, I think that peace is the best. Only in peace can we build a wonderful home. Fighting is too much!” Third Fatty Jin rubbed his hands with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jail King nodded, then walked beside him and patted him on the shoulders, “Not bad. Your mindset is so much better than your Senior Brother’s. The outrageously intelligent will be hurt, the outrageously strong will be shamed, the outrageously stubborn will not prevail, those who fall too deeply in love will get not live long. Your Senior Brother will end up getting into huge trouble.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Jail King smiled, shook his head, then left with his arm around Yang Jian’s shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Huh? I wonder what happened between those two. They actually get along so well now.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Since there isn’t a show anymore, then I’m off,” Wei Chen also shook his head, and left from the arched gate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Third Fatty Jin saw that everyone had left, he said worriedly, “Boss Ye.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wasn’t familiar with all the powerhouses, and they seemed to have a terrible impression of his senior brother.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If they were to let out their anger on him, he wouldn’t dare to fight back since he lacked his senior brother’s might.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They won’t let out their anger on you, but what they said was right. Those who think too highly of themselves will not prevail. Your senior brother is simply too proud. His arrogant personality will sooner or later cause him to fall over and never be able to get back up.”</span></p>

 <p>Hmmm, where should we stay tonight? The village is obviously not going to fit us all... Ahh, maybe it can, we should try...</p>
 <p>Or maybe not. Goddamnit, we should have built more houses. Why didn't we anticipate this!?</p>
 <p>Hmmm, I suppose some of us are going to have to stay elsewhere. No, that's not so good. If we're leaving, then all of us are leaving. But where on earth are we going to find housing for all of us? We're going to be here for quite a few more days. Perhaps we should just build more houses...</p>
 <p>Wait, actually. No, there is a place which can fit all of us... That manor over there!</p>
