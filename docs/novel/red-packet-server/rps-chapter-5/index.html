 <p><span style>Chapter 5 – Great Sage Sun’s Fiery Eyes of Truth</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen crawled out from his dormitory bed, while rubbing his throbbing head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had gotten terribly drunk due to Su Yiyun the previous night. He was so drunk that he couldn’t even remember how he returned to the dorm the previous night.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He quickly picked up his phone. The chat group was full of deities, it was only a coincidence that he, a mere mortal, could even enter it. It would be terrible if he got kicked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was fortunate that the chat group was still there. The deities were still chatting tirelessly. Ye Zichen scrolled up, and saw that they had sent a few red packets in the middle of the night, but since Ye Zichen was drunk to the point of being unconscious, he naturally didn’t manage to snatch any.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen felt a slight sadness for that, but he still smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were still plenty of days left in the future. The red packets were sent every day, did he need to be worried about not getting any?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just when he finished washing up, a bunch of people in police clothing appeared at the dorm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who is Ye Zichen?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was confused, he didn’t do anything bad, why did the police come to look for him?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could something have happened to Commissioner Liu?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck, but that was the Great Recovery Pill from Old Lord Taishang, there shouldn’t be any issues!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“We received a report suspecting you have committed fraud. Come with us to the station.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yao Yue sat on the sofa in the police station. She was the person that had reported him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had crazily snatched back all of the underworld money. The scratch marks on her were proof of how much she fought for it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had thought that she finally managed to rise, but when she looked at the money, she found out that it was actually underworld money.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It could be said that she had wasted her time and got nothing out of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since she was unable to accept that, she called the police.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I guessed that it was you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just when Ye Zichen walked through the door, he couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yao Yue stood up from the sofa and screamed with a sullen expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style> “Ye Zichen, you actually tricked me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aiya, that’s weird, what did I trick you out of?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You actually tricked me with two boxes of underworld money.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Girl, be more careful when you speak. I did smash you with underworld money, but I merely smashed you. What did I get from you? Did I take any cash away from you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen revealed a cold expression. This sort of women that was so obsessed with money couldn’t even tell the difference between underworld money and real money.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He truly was blind before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The police station isn’t a place for you two to argue, come in with us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The policemen took Ye Zichen towards the interrogation room, while Yao Yue also walked in behind them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just after entering the building with the interrogation room, Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows and smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Officer Zhang, how have you been?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Comrade Little Ye, why are you here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Officer Zhang was actually a pretty nice person, he just merely didn’t want Commissioner Liu to take the risk the previous day, causing him to seem a little aggressive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen had saved Commissioner Liu, he had wanted to thank him, but he just never found the opportunity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just at this moment, Yao Yue also walked in from the outside. Officer Zhang instantly blanked and asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re the swindler?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Officer Zhang, don’t make fun of me. Do you think I look like a swindler?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shrugged helplessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He is a swindler, he is…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yao Yue got so worked up, like she was about to eat someone. Officer Zhang frowned and slammed his hands down on the table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shut up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His actions freaked Yao Yue out. She immediately stopped daring to make a scene, and merely sat quietly down on a chair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tell the me situation…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen spoke about the entire situation, including the relationship between him and Yao Yue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Officer Zhang’s gaze towards Yao Yue turned a bit hostile. When Ye Zichen finished, he added.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Officer Zhang, smashing someone with money is my mistake, but it doesn’t reach the level of fraud, right? Look, can I leave now? If you can’t solve this, then I’ll just call Commissioner Liu?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t bother him, Commissioner Liu is still resting. I can handle this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, Ye Zichen walked out of the police station without any harm. Just after he walked out of the entrance, he saw a red Ferrari 458 parked at the entrance, with Su Yiyun pacing with his head down just outside the door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ol’ Three, why are you here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun immediately raised his head and ran over to Ye Zichen’s side, then patted his shoulders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You alright?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk, can something small like them trouble me?” Ye Zichen smiled in contempt. Yao Yue and co. were a bit too immature trying to deal with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I knew that you would be fine,” As Su Yiyun spoke, he took out a bank card from his pocket. “There’s two hundred thousand in this card, it’s my dad’s thanks for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can’t accept the money.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop pretending, my dad said that your pill was definitely worth more than that. We already got an advantage by giving you two hundred thousand. Just hurry and put it away. Don’t you like to rip off rich people? My dad is one.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then, I suppose it would be rude of me to decline.”</span></p>
 <p><span style> Su Yiyun only smiled when Ye Zichen put the card in his pocket.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come, older brother will bring you to see something.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Ye Zichen sat in Su Yiyun’s sports car, he kept on watching the chat group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was strange was that nobody actually sent red packets through the entire morning, they were all chatting about something like reformation of the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Ye Zichen couldn’t understand it, he just put his phone away and checked out the car.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ol’ Three, what exactly does your family </span><i><span style>do</span></i><span style>?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My dad just a little bit of trading.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little bit of trading?” Ye Zichen showed an expression of disbelief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun shrugged and smiled, “Don’t not believe it, I’m going to bring you somewhere later, the people there are all super rich people.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen’s phone suddenly rang, he used the quickest speed possible to take out his phone. Su Yiyun at his side smiled and said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Girlfriend?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s not like you don’t know it was just finished.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then couldn’t you have gotten a new one?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun did not comfort Ye Zichen like the other people in the dorm. The main reason was because they had different ways of living, so they also thought differently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen ignored him and focused on watching the chat group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just now, the Immortality Peach Fairy<sup><a id="ref1" href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> had sent out a red packet, and obviously, when Ye Zichen went to snatch it, they were already gone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He clicked to see the luck of other people, and found that the Monkey King had the best luck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, the group was also chatting about this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: Great Sage, you snatch red packets every single time, but I haven’t seen you send any. That isn’t good, right? &lt;smirk&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: Why should Old Sun send any?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhu Bajie: Senior Martial Brother, don’t be so stingy. Even the fairy sent some, it’s not good if you don’t.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: This monkey is so stingy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Without saying anything, a red packet was sent with a ring, as if Erlang Shen’s words had angered the Monkey King.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Snatch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fiery Eyes of Truth Secret Scripture Level 1 x1</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Fiery Eyes of Truth</span></i><span style>.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen momentarily blanked, then felt his heart beat.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This can’t f*cking be Great Sage Sun’s Fiery Eyes of Truth, right?</span></i><span style> The godly ability that can identity demons and monsters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he took a look at everybody else’s luck, he found that everyone else had gotten a peach.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Did I get the grand prize?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but to laugh idiotically. Hearing his maniacal laughter, Su Yiyun couldn’t help but chuckle.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He’s still saying that it’s not his girlfriend?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>But this is good as well, Ye Zichen can soften his heartache with a girlfriend, so he doesn’t need to go and find one for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who was still fantasizing about having the Fiery Eyes of Truth like the Monkey King, suddenly found a friend request in his contact list.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he saw this friend request, Ye Zichen’s hands shuddered, causing his phone to nearly fall out of his hands.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Crap, was he about to be found out?</span></i></p>
