 <p><span style>Chapter 725 – The Cuckoo and the Swallow</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m going to murder you!” Hua Kui could not suppress her rage anymore when she saw Gu Li put Mou Qing’s heart in his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though she was ranked last amongst the Demon Sovereigns due to her illusions, she was in no mood to use something like that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m going to kill you and take revenge for Third Big Brother!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hua Kui could only use the a woman’s most commonly used weapon in her fit of rage…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her nails.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She leaped towards Gu Li and scratched.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although she was not particularly strong, she was one of the Demon Sovereigns with the strength of a late-stage Sky Immortal. Her scratch was able to even the hardest rocks, but it merely left a white mark on Gu Li’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Li wiped his cheek, then smirked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You dared to scratch my face?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Die!” Hua Kui did not hear him, nor did she want to. She merely repeated her simple weapon and left white marks on Gu Li’s face one after another.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Li grabbed Hua Kui’s arm, then smiled, “Did you know that I have a bottom line as well? I never kill women.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tch,” Hua Kui spat at Gu Li.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He smiled evilly as he wiped the spit away, then slid his finger across Hua Kui’s face, “What a delicate face.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t touch me!” Hua Kui struggled maniacally and threw her arms and legs at Gu Li.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Normally speaking, I might leave you around to be something I can use to unleash my desires. But you should never have tried to scratch my face and spit your dirty saliva!” Gu Li’s expression turned sinister, but at that very moment…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ptui.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Another mouthful of saliva was spat on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You bitch!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Li put more force into his grip and shattered Hua Kui’s arm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, Hua Kui merely frowned, then spat at Gu Li’s face again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kill me if you dare!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I said I never kill women!” Gu Li smiled, then started punching at her mouth. “Keep spitting, won’t you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon, blood and teeth begun to flow out of Hua Kui’s mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet… That was not the end of it. After he knocked out all her teeth, he grabbed her hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You used this to scratch me, didn’t you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He started to rip off her fingernails one by one. However, Hua Kui did not let out a single sound. She merely stared at Gu Li with her rageful eyes and stark white face, then finally used the last strength in her body to spit at Gu Li’s face once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As blood covered his face…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>You dared to defile my holy face, she actually dared…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Creak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you want to die?” Gu Li’s chest heaved up and down as he clenched his fists tightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hua Kui maintained her smile and looked demeaningly at him, “Tsk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fine!” The aura around Gu Li began to strength. He stared at Hua Kui’s bloody face. “Since you want to die, then I shall break my bottom line once!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blood splattered everywhere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Hua Kui was still smiling the moment right before her head was shattered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She knew that she couldn’t extract revenge for her Third Big Brother, but she could die for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Third Big Brother, I won’t let you be alone on the way to the afterlife.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Several Demon Sovereigns had bloodshot eyes, including Li Min’e. Despite their differences, Hua Kui was one of her closest friends.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Gu Li dared to torture her like that!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Unforgivable!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, they had to get through the three people in front of them to get to Gu Li.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The three metallic skinned people with stark white faces blocked their paths the instant Hua Kui had rushed over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the Demon Sovereigns wanted to save Hua Kui, their rationale told them that the three monstrous beings in front of them were no easy foes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While they thought to themselves, Gu Li already cleaned the filth from his face, but he still continued to wipe at his face with a handkerchief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gu Li!” Li Min’e gritted her teeth in anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Li Min’e, don’t be so angry. I’ll tell you something. You can leave now if you want. I won’t do make things difficult for you because of Old Su.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Su? You two are working together!?” One of the Demon Sovereigns roared in anger. “I knew non-demons like you will have ulterior motives!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No!” Li Min’e shouted. “Yiyun won’t betray me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re still speaking up for him? Li Min’e, I opposed the two of you being together from the start!” The first ranked Demon Sovereign said coldly. He was always interested in Li Min’e and always felt that he was the most suitable husband.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, Li Min’e actually fell for an insect he could crush easily back then.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was why he never liked Su Yiyun even after the latter became the demons’ formation master.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No! Yiyun would never betray me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shitty grandson, I know what you’re trying to do, so stop trying to frame Old Su.” To everyone’s surprise, Gu Li actually spoke up for Su Yiyun. “I very much want Master Su to work with me. Yet, despite all my reasons such as both of us being from the Modern Realm, it is very unfortunate that Master Su is still considering it and did not agree.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He is still considering!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Am I supposed to agree instead of mulling it over?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, a white-robed elder appeared in the sky. Anyone would judge from his white hair and dried skill that he was an old man whose time was nearly up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the demons knew that he was Su Yiyun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In truth, he was merely in his twenties.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Su,” Gu Li walked up with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Su Yiyun ignored him and merely walked over to Li Min’e. “Thank the gods that you’re still alive.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Min’e leaped into his arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first ranking Demon Sovereign’s eyes twitched.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun merely glanced at the demon in disdain when he felt the hostility. Then, he caressed Li Min’e hair and nodded towards Black Dragon before walking over to Gu Li.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, for some reason, Gu Li was no longer smiling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ve decided? We are both from the Modern Realm and have near identical goals. Why work towards greatness with me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re just a cuckoo taking over a swallow’s nest. Do you really think that you’re the that great?”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Original Chapter Teaser:</strong>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Gu Li munching on the bloody heart was the last straw for Hua Kui. No matter how much she tried to suppress her anger, she was unable to tolerate Gu Li defiling her crush's body and turning him into mere food. That was too much for her.</p>
 <p>She ran out without thinking and lashed out instinctively. No swords,&nbsp;no daggers, no staffs, no spears. She did not even think about that. She merely reached out with a&nbsp;weapon that all women have - their nails. She clawed at Gu Li in a frenzied manner, time and time again.</p>
 <p>Surprised by that, Gu&nbsp;Li stepped back, but Hua Kui did not care. She merely continued to pressure him and scratch at his face, chest and hands until he turned into a bloody mess that was less than a human,&nbsp;much less a demon.</p>
 <p>But...</p>
 <p>That was merely what Hua Kui and the Demon Sovereigns wished to see.</p>
 <p>The truth was that Hua Kui didn't even break Gu Li's skin. She feeble scratches only seemed to irritate him...</p>

 <p>Alright, I screwed up with time management real bad. Between the interview (which you should be able to see soon on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVfwsgGqyOWpJFwG6dpVgxg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Immortal Index's channel</a>), permanent overtime at work and family, I didn't find time to TL RPS at all (which means my&nbsp;stockpile ran out). Thus, I'm not going to be able to release any of the owed/sponsored chapters for you today. What I will be doing though is making sure that I TL at least 2 SMTM and 1 RPS chapter per day on weekdays and more on the weekends so slowly catch back up. Also, I'll be keeping count of how many RPS chapters I owe you guys so I can make it all up to you guys when I go back to Switzerland.&nbsp;<em>I also thought that I release Chapter 722 yesterday, but apparently, I haven't...</em></p>
 <p>Owed Chapters Count: 4 (+sponsored chapters)</p>
