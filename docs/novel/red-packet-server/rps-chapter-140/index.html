 <p><span style>Chapter 140 – Zhuge Kongming’s identity</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen counted up the number of items according to Yue Lao’s list and scanned it over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, a bunch of red packets appeared on the chat with Yue Lao. After sending all of the items, Ye Zichen also stretched lazily and prepared to receive the cultivation experience.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Blackie, why did you come here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen didn’t think that there was any special issue being seen by Blackie. Humans and ghosts don’t interact normally, what’s more, Blackie was his subordinate, so he wasn’t afraid of the secret being leaked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just to come and take a look.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Take a look if you want.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded. At this moment, Yue Lao received all the items, then sent another message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, how much cultivation experience is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“About a hundred thousand or so. I don’t want to calculate in detail, so just give me ninety thousand with the ten percent discount.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received Yue Lao’s red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cultivation experience x90000.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Celestial position increased. Currently a Level 5 Celestial Official.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Celestial Badge: Sky Sovereign Nameless (Cultivation Experience: 91612. Total Cultivation Experience: 102500. Level 5 Official Position)</span></p>
 <p><span style>His celestial position increased once again.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>But what exactly was that for?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, he really did have tons of cultivation experience. Of course, he is still a distant away from buying those secret scriptures from the Treasure Shop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, if he tried his luck at the roulette…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received Heavenly Court Dog Food x1.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received Heavenly Court Cabbage x1</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received Heavenly Court Soil x1.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen wanted to cought up blood. He got things worth 100 cultivation experience all three times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was like opening treasure chests in a video game…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Tons of losses!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen collected his thoughts, and eyed the celestial badge with a frown.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck, he had ninety something thousand cultivation experience just now. Now, he only had sixty something thousand left.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Celestial sovereign, then let’s chat next time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows and hurriedly stopped him when he saw that Yue Lao wanted to leave immediately after getting the products.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait a moment!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao, who was about to go and sell the products within the celestial halls, suddenly paused, then asked in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What other requests does celestial sovereign have?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How is that geezer Old Lord Taishang…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ever since Ye Zichen deleted Old Lord Taishang from his friend list, the two of them never talked. Ye Zichen had deleted Old Lord Taishang on an impulse. It was also because he felt that his business in the Heavenly Court would definitely be through the roof, and also due to him learning Old Lord Taishang’s special medical skills!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen thought that he wouldn’t require Old Lord Taishang’s pills.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he could have never imagined that reviving Liu Qing would require Old Lord taishang’s Three Striped Soul-Clearing Heaven-Returning Pill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most importantly, this was a celestial leveled pill…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen wanted to see the situation from Yue Lao to see if he could request the pill from Old Lord Taishang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“About Old Lord, the old daoists that refine pills all have a stubborn temper. I chatted with him about it, and asked him if celestial sovereign would step back, he could… However, he said that he won’t have any interactions with celestial sovereign in the future. That’s why, about half of the stuff I asked for are the stuff he wants.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ouch.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed like the situation wasn’t good.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen scratched his head and sent a message in annoyance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then does Yue lao know who I can purchase the Three Striped Soul-Clearing Heaven-Returning Pill from?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Three Striped Soul-Clearing Heaven-Returning Pill?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao couldn’t help but to be shocked when he saw the name of this pill. This was a celestial leveled pill. There wasn’t anyone else could possibly provide it outside of Old Lord Taishang within the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Only Old Lord Taishang has it. However… Three Striped Soul-Clearing Heaven-Returning Pill is a celestial leveled pill, even that geezer…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The road to revival was truly filled with trouble. From Yue Lao’s words, it seemed like even Old Lord Taishang might not be able to provide it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If even Old Lord Taishang, one of the Three Pure Ones, could not provide it, then…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ugh.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“How about this. Yue Lao, just help me ask Old Lord Taishang. Recently, I really need this pill.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then, no problem.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, that’s it. Find me when you need to stock up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen never thought that revival would be easy, but he didn’t think that reviving someone would be so hard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen scratched his head in frustration. When he raised his head, he saw that Blackie, who was behind him, was completely shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you feel like it’s rather amazing? I feel that it’s amazing as well,” Ye Zichen pursed his lips and smiled. “You’ve been in supermarket, what do you think about the kid, Zhuge Kongming?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pretty nice, quite obedient.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I feel like the kid is quite obedient as well, but him continuing to stay here isn’t going to work,” Ye Zichen did not suspect Blackie of being on Zhuge Kongming’s side at all. He merely sighed, “I have plenty of secrets on me, he’ll find out sooner or later if he stays here. Never mind, stay here properly and protect Kongming, do you understand?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood,” Blackie immediately nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, Ye Zichen waved his hand towards Blackie, “Alright, go back up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sat with Zhuge Kongming for a while longer. He only patted Zhuge Kongming’s shoulder when the night arrived, then left the supermarket after giving Blackie a cue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment the supermarket door closed, Zhuge Kongming raised his eyebrows and smiled, “What secrets does Zichen-gege have? You should have seen it right? Tell me quickly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhuge Kongming did not appear to have any ill intentions at all, it was as if he was purely curious about the secret.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, he…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blackie continued to hesitate. He was a true, loyal soldier while he was alive, and had never done any double-agent sort of thing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I definitely won’t tell anyone else, and won’t cause trouble for Zichen-gege. I’m just curious, so tell me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you don’t say it, then I won’t help you nurture your soul ever again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that Zhuge Kongming truly got hold of his weak spot, Blackie clenched his teeth after a brief thought, “Actually, Boss…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blackie did speak, but even though the sound of him moving his lips could be heard, no sound came out of his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ghost Controlling Sigil,” Zhuge Kongming frowned, then searched Blackie. Not long after that, a sigil appeared in his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now speak.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blackie straightforwardly talked about what he saw underground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Zhuge Kongming couldn’t help but smile, “I knew Zichen-gege was someone from our side. I expect for him to be able to contact the ones in the Heavenly Court, he should be someone from the Nine Hidden Families, but…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhuge Kongming frowned. He looked at the Ghost Controlling Sigil in his hands…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This thingy should be a treasure from the ghost servants of the Underworld. Why would someone of the hidden renowned families stick such a precious sigil on you,” Not long later, Zhuge Kongming was stunned as he realized. “Wait, the person that has this Ghost Controlling Sigil stuck on them cannot betray their master. You wanted to reveal Zichen-gege’s secret just now… Zichen-gege stuck this sigil on you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why didn’t you say so earlier…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A hint of franticness appeared on Zhuge Kongming’s face. By ripping this sigil off…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh, why am I so stupid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhuge Kongming hit his head. </span><i><span style>Ye Zichen brought this ghost over, of course he stuck the sigil on.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why didn’t I think of that when I ripped it off!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Ye Zichen, who was standing at the side of the road and waiting to take a taxi back to school, felt a sudden pain from his chest.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ugh.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A mouthful of blood spurt out from Ye Zichen’s mouth uncontrollably.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing, who was floating beside Ye Zichen, was instantly stunned when she saw this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen!”</span></p>
