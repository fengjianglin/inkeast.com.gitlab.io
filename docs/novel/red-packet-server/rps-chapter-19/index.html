 <p><span style>Chapter 19 – Xiao Yumei’s Red String of Marriage</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since the ore price was six hundred and sixty thousand, the price was rather nice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing someone asked for the stone to be cut, a bunch of jewelers surrounded them. Yet, when they saw Ye Zichen’s rock, they all lost interest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Which idiot bought this rock?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, it would be a wonder if this crappy piece of rock gives out jade.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the comments were for one side. Everyone felt that this rock would not give out jade. Elder Liu also smiled coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If this rock could give out jade, then it would be fine if he ate the crappy piece of rock that Director Bai cut just now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Director Xiao, how do you want to cut it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The stonecutter took the rock down, while Xiao Yumei got Ye Zichen to come over with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ask him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s eyes flashed with a gold light. After a brief moment, he picked up the chalk, but was unsure of how to draw the line.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you drawing for, just cut it down the middle to show that it’s a loss.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ol’ Three,” Ye Zichen suddenly called Su Yiyun over. “If the surface is so close to the jade that it can’t be cut, what should be done?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rub!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you cursing me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I said rub!” Su Yiyun rolled his eyes and make the gesture of rubbing the stone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did Ye Zichen understand. He turned around and shouted at the stonecutter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rub it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ha.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The entire crowd instantly sneered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Does this sort of rock need rubbing? Does he really think that the rock is pure jade?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He must have gone mad wishing for money.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Liu also them mocked off to the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The customer is always right, since he was asked to rub the rock, the stonecutter naturally had to follow their instructions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The stonecutter took out the sandpaper board and furiously rubbed on the ore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>White powder fell from the rock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Green, it’s green…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the people with sharp eyes saw the green, the stonecutter also was amazed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pour water.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A bucket of water splashed down, causing the jade-green to become even more clear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial green!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone on the scene went wild, such a bad-looking rock actually gave out jade, and it was an imperial jade.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Liu’s face looked like he ate fly crap…</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a blatant smack to his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir, would you like us to continue?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Continue!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled. The stonecutter immediately rubbed even harder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This sort of imperial jade could only have been found by chance, they don’t see much of this sort of gemstone even though they cut stones every day, so they worked even harder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He won, he won a lot!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everybody exclaimed continuously. Xiao Yumei also covered her mouth on the side and opened her eyes wide.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He actually won.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When another bucket of water was splashed down, the shade of green on the ore was already extremely sharp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Continue!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen revealed a confident smile, he knew very clearly whether this rock’s green was just a layer or if it was completely green.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little bro, don’t rub anymore, what if you lose! How about selling it to me for ten million?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bastard, you want to buy Imperial Jade with ten million, do you think you’re buying leftovers! I’ll pay twenty million…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The price continuously rose. Xiao Yumei bit her lips and looked towards Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, can you sell this ore to me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mei-jie, you really know how to crack a joke, you bought this rock, this rock is yours.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shrugged, then smiled towards Xiao Yumei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei looked at the carefree Ye Zichen in shock. All of a sudden, she didn’t know what to say.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This imperial jade could make so many pieces of jewelry, it was worth at least billions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But he…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing Ye Zichen and Xiao Yumei’s conversation, the surrounding jewelers all stopped calling their price.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei was kind of famous in the circle, everyone in the industry felt a bit jealous of her for betting on such a great gemstone, but what they felt more of was congratulations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen walked over to Elder Liu. At this moment, Elder Liu’s expression was already terrible to the max.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jade had appeared, and it was a complete imperial jade.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Elder Liu, what do you think?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This old man did make a mistake,” Elder Liu snorted, while clenching his teeth. However, Ye Zichen twitched his mouth and said, “If you aren’t good at it, then stop conning people. Expert? What a joke.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite having a lot of retorts, Elder Liu was unable to say any of them. He could only leave his annoyance buried in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled as he saw Elder Liu’s annoyance. At this moment, Su Yiyun also came over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi, what’s going on? Did it really give out jade?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you think? If it doesn’t, then would I tell Mei-jie to buy it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But that imperial jade is worth at least eighty or ninety million. Since you know that it would definitely give out jade, why didn’t you buy it? It’s not like you can’t afford it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun said curiously. This was no small amount, even he would be moved by this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, let me give you an example. If you desperately need this jade to keep your business afloat, and I gift it to you after buying it with my own money. Would you take it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, it’s too valuable.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then if it was with your money?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That would seem to be better.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun thought about it, then very quickly understood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You were intentionally helping Director Xiao.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You aren’t that dumb.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But, Ye-zi, you really are generous, giving out a gemstone worth billions just like that,” Su Yiyun raised a thumb towards Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just giving her a helping hand, do you understand? Mei-jie’s company is in trouble, since I can help, then why not?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes at Su Yiyun. What they didn’t know was that Xiao Yumei had heard everything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei has always showed an image of a strong independent woman in front of other people, but no one understood just how fragile her inner self was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she heard that Ye Zichen thought so much for her, her heart instantly had a different feeling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Received Marriage String x1.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Another marriage string?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen momentarily blanked. He didn’t do anything, why did another marriage string appear?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He clicked open his Treasure Chest on his phone, then saw two marriage strings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One of them belonged to Su Yan and him!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other one…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Possessor: Ye Zichen, Possessed: Xiao Yumei</span></p>
 <p><span style>Affability level: 100</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Damn!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was very confused, how did he get a marriage string with Xiao Yumei, and the affability level was so high as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was actually 100.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan and his was only 40.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sneaked a peak towards Xiao Yumei and found that she was looking straight at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The gentleness in her eyes was about to melt him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>No, no!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen quickly turned around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei had a daughter, that clearly means that she is married.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Then what was this marriage string?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The third person?</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Xiao Yumei walked towards Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mei-jie.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Due to the existence of the marriage string, Ye Zichen clearly understood that Xiao Yumei held some feelings for him, causing him to feel weird even when he was onlyspeaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This ore is truly too important for older sister, you truly helped older sister a lot.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is my honor to help Mei-jie.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei felt more and more moved, while the gentleness in her eyes became clearer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Su Yiyun, who was on the side, felt the strangeness in the atmosphere. He immediately revealed a meaningful smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, you saved Tiantian and helped older sister out so much. Older sister doesn’t know how to repay you. How about this, come to older sister’s home so that she came make you a meal personally?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, Xiao Yumei’s eyes sparkled with anticipation.</span></p>
