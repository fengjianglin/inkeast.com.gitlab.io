 <p><span style>Chapter 485 – Causing Havoc at the Azure Sky Pavilion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the Azure Sky Pavilion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As one of the top powers of the eastern continent, the interior of the Azure Sky Pavilion of the Six Pavilions was naturally decorated very glamorously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Pavilion itself was situated on a slope of a tall mountain that reached high into the clouds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the earth dragon carriages slowly stopped in front of the gate, the patrolling Azure Sky Pavilion’s patrolling outer disciples also walked over. However, when they saw that it was actually an earth dragon carriage, they did not dare to put on an arrogant front at all, and merely placed their hands in front of their stomach and bowed as appropriate for people of their status.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is the Azure Sky Pavilion?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows after getting off the dragon carriage. While he was in the Modern Realm, he would often imagine how the gates to the peak forces in television and novels were like.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now that he took a look. </span><i><span style>It’s nothing special.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>There was definitely no denying the Azure Sky Pavilion’s strength, since it should have its capabilities even though it was merely at the bottom of the Six Pavilions. Ye Zichen took a glance at the setup of the Pavilions itself, and judged that it should have been located there after someone had chopped off the top half of the mountain.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Someone who can do that was definitely not normal.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I wonder what have you all come to our Azure Sky Pavilion for?” an outer disciple dressed in a blue robe with black trims asked kindly. An earth dragon was an extremely valuable manner of transport in the Immortal Region, and those who can use it to pull a carriage were either rich or powerful. Although he and the others were disciples of the Azure Sky Pavilion, they were merely outer disciples, so they didn’t dare to act pretentiously with those kinds of people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We came to cause trouble!” Ye Zichen smiled. While the outer disciples were shopped, he yanked out Luo Zhi, who was like a dead dog.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior Brother Luo Zhi!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Zuo Mo and Xue Lan walked out of the carriage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xue Lan?” the outer disciple frowned, then shouted at the junior brother behind him. “Hurry up and notify the guest chamberlains and elders, those villagers from Spiritual Breeze Village came to cause trouble!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other outer disciples hurriedly ran towards the inner areas of the pavilion. However, a large hand, which appeared out of nowhere of the sky, directly captured all of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need to report. I like to give surprises for other people.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang, bang, bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the outer disciples were suppressed onto the ground by Ye Zichen. Then, Ye Zichen dragged Luo Zhi behind him with his left hand, and caressed Xue Lan’s head, “Scared?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No!” Xue Lan shook her head and smiled. “I’m not afraid of anything when I’m with Zichen-gege.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t lower your heads, no matter what happens. Zichen-ge is definitely going to help you cancel this engagement.” Ye Zichen smiled, then slowly walked towards the gate to the Azure Sky Pavilion. Right after entering, he looked up at the large characters of “Azure Sky Pavilion”.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Azure Sky Pavilion…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen punched one of the huge stone pillars, then walked in. The moment he left, cracks spread through the stone pillar before it cracked, leaving a pile of shattered rocks onto the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Along the way in, Ye Zichen had to step over countless people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, what was surprising was that even after being there for nearly ten minutes, Ye Zichen did not even see a single guest chamberlain or elder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are you, to actually dare to act so outrageously at the Azure Sky Pavilion!?” At that very moment, a middle-aged man with triangular eyes a small patch of beard shouted out. He wore a crimson daoist robe, while his black and white hair fluttered in the sky, making him seem rather like a daoist immortal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ninth Elder, save me,” Luo Zhi had already awakened, but because his spiritual energy had been completely sealed by Ye Zichen, he was no different from a normal person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had been dragged over the entire way, so his legs and feet were already a bloody mess from rubbing against the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His face was also stark white, making him look like he was going to pass on at any moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Luo Zhi,” the triangular-eyed man was stunned. He then set his gaze upon Xue Lan. “You’ve got guts. The puny Spiritual Breeze Village actually dared to come and act so outrageously at our Azure Sky Pavilion. Release Luo Zhi, then kowtow three hundred times towards the gate of the Azure Sky Pavilion. If you do that, then I can have mercy on you and let you live!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man released a powerful aura, causing the spiritual energy in the surrounding air to increase in weight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xue Lan was never strong, so her face instantly turned stark white when the man released his aura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen noticed this and patted her shoulders, while injecting a stream of pure spiritual energy into her body. At the same time, a barely visible light shield also covered her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kid, you’re still not kneeling!?” the triangular-eyed man frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his head slowly, then smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang, bang, bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nobody knew what happened during that split second. The only thing that the surrounding outer disciples saw was that when they noticed what had happened, Ye Zichen stood where the triangular-eyed man stood, while the cocky man was being stepped on by him, and was unable to move at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Laozi can’t even be bothered with a small fry like you,” Ye Zichen mocked, then kicked him ten-odd meters away. The man coughed up a large mouthful of blood, while a deep wariness could be seen through his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Human Immortal.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As the Ninth Elder of the Azure Sky Pavilion, he was already at the late-stage of the Human Immortal level. The only way that this person in front of him was able to defeat him without letting him counterattack at all was that the person in front of him had already reached the Human immortal level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he was unable to understand why the person in front of him was actually so young.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop watching there like an idiot. Go and inform all of the management level people in the Azure Sky Pavilion. Tell them that, we, the people from the Spiritual Breeze Village, have come to cancel the engagement!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen stood straight within the Azure Sky Pavilion, and stopped speaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“First Elder, this is terrible.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A frantic shout sounded out outside a room filled with the smell of burning candles. A curse of annoyance sounded out in response. Not long later, a square-faced elder in messy clothing walked out from within, while sweat covered his forehead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s terrible?” the First Elder knitted his eyebrows and cursed as he tied up the knots on his clothes. Meanwhile, the figure of a woman could still be seen walking around his room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, a young lady walked out from within. “Daddy, since you have other things to deal with, I’m going to head back. Luo Zhi might come back later!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go!” the First Elder nodded his head with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman pushed her long hair back behind her ear, then left the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, the heart of the disciple, who went over to report to the First Elder what had happened, was filled with disdain…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Anyone can easily guess what had happened just now!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Do not mention what you have saw today to anyone. Understand?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This disciple understands,” the outer disciple quickly nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Say, what kind of huge deal made you act so frantically. You should know about the consequence of finding me for some puny matters!” the First Elder snorted darkly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The disciple gulped, then replied, “Someone’s fought their way up the mountain. They claim to be people from the Spiritual Breeze Village, and came to… cancel the engagement!”</span></p>
