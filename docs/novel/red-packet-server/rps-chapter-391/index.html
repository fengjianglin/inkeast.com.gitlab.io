 <p><span style>The pig-headed fatty smiled in a mocking manner, while the fighters also closed in on Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My lord, run… I can take a beating very well. Come and save me after you get reinforcements,” the little beggar pushed Ye Zichen away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This simple action caused Ye Zichen to be truly moved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He rubbed the little beggar’s head with a smile, then stepped forward, “Are you sure you’re going to make a move on me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandson, stop pretending with laozi. A mere mortal being in the Underworld is a huge sin. After I beat you up, I’ll chuck you to the Yama Kings. Hehe… Let’s see what happens to you then,” the pig-head fatty’s expression was covered in disdain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded, and took out his phone…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Help me! I’m at the Central Street of the Ghost Region. A pig-head fatty blocked me off. He wants to hit me…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Woosh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen instantly sent the message to several people. Then, he returned his phone back into his pocket with a smile, “If you stop now, then we might still have a room for negotiation!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop pretending,” the pig head fatty snorted with a smile. “Do it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen did indeed send the message, but he could not be sure that they would immediately receive the news. Ye Zichen must protect himself and the little beggar before those people arrive.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>These people around me don’t look like they’re easily bullied. </span></i><span style>Ye Zichen clenched his teeth…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Capture the commander first!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen kicked the ghosts near him, then reached towards the pig head fatty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmph, you want to deal with me? I, Lord Fatty, have trained before!” the pig head fatty snorted then took a step back, then two ghosts instantly appeared in his original position, both of whom punched towards Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen carelessly took a punch, he raised his hand to touch where he was hit.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>They really can hit me!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“My lord, run…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little beggar’s face was covered in anxiety. He had wanted to help several times, but he was sent flying by a single kick every single time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck, laozi has never gotten beaten in the Modern Realm, so how can I get beaten here in the Underworld?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen instantly allowed his spiritual energy to circulate through his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The faint aura of spiritual pressure radiated out from Ye Zichen’s body. Everyone was shocked by the huge spiritual energy fluctuation, but after sensing the true strength of the person that released it...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“False Earth Immortal. Who cares, go!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, are you looking down on False Earth Immortal? Laozi’s going to give you guys a lesson!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen charged towards those people. At that moment, he already stopped trying to put up any defenses, since Unbreakable Body would mean that he would never get too injured…</span></p>
 <p><span style>What he had to do was beat the ghosts until they were scared, and endure everything until the people he sent messages to arrive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ox-Head, who had only just finished wandering around from the outside, rolled his neck and took out his phone, only to find a message on it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Help me! I’m at the Central Street of the Ghost Region. A pig-head fatty blocked me off. He wants to hit me…”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Brother Beanbun’s getting beaten up!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ox-Head immediately pocketed his phone and shouted towards Horse-face, “Bring our people and come with me to Central Street of the Ghost Region.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the Xie Manor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Lei’s status in the Xie family rose a lot after presenting Ye Zichen’s tin of tea leaves. At that moment, he was playing Go with Xie Bian. Then, his phone, which he placed on the side, buzzed. What’s more, it wasn’t only his, as Xie Bian’s phone also buzzed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both of them took a look at the message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Xie Bian raised his eyebrows and smiled, “That’s your guy, right? He actually sent me the message as well. But, let’s go over and take a look. I do want to see how dares to bully someone of our Xie manor!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry up. Watch me take care of you if you guys walk slowly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The White Impermanence Intern also hurried over to the Central Street of the Ghost Region with seventy to eighty ghosts behind her. She was the first one to see Ye Zichen’s message, but she was truly too far…</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, countless people moved…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ignorant bystanders all followed with a look of curiosity behind them when they saw so many angry people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Ye Zichen truly couldn’t take it anymore…</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the people the pig-head fatty brought were probably of the Earth Immortal level. Ye Zichen might have been able to deal with one or two, but several tens of them truly tired Ye Zichen out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen panted heavily, but the fighters were not in a much better condition as they also panted around him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pig head fatty, who was watching the show, twitched his mouth and walked over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandson, want to keep pretending with grandpa?” the pig faced fatty raised his foot to kick Ye Zichen, but the latter did not have any strength to dodge it anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment…</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>A white chain suddenly wrapped itself around the pig-headed fatty’s neck. Bai Rou<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> levitated in the air as she held the end of the chain, which she then used to fling the fatty onto a nearby wall.</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you alright?” Bai Rou descended from the air worriedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but smile when he saw her, “You were actually the one who came first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry, I was a bit far, so I came rather slowly,” Bai Rou knitted her eyebrows slightly worriedly when she saw the injuries on Ye Zichen’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, she was not in her uniform, so her actual form was exposed in front of everyone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Ye Zichen couldn’t help but be shocked again when he took another look at her beauty. </span><i><span style>I really don’t understand why that Black Impermanence would cheat on her!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Bai Rou!” the pig head fatty frowned, then touched his neck, which had been wrapped with the chain. “You’ve truly got guts. You actually dared to use a Soul Reaping Chain to touch Lord Fatty’s neck.”</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>“Bao Tan<a id="footnoteref-2" href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>, hurry up and f*ck off. I’m annoyed just from seeing your piggy face,” Bai Rou stood up with her hands on her waist, then turned to the ghosts she brought over. “Watch all of them carefully. If they dare to make any move, go and beat them up. We’ve got more people, so three on one is definitely fine… If you get hurt, then laoniang will compensate you guys later. If you beat them until they get disabled, then you’ll get a bonus!”</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, Bai Rou… You care about this brat pretty much. Is he your new sugar baby?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck you!” Bai Rou squinted her eyes and cursed. “It really is strange, how did Marshal Leopard end up with a grandson like you. You’re a crossbreed aren’t you? Pig head… Zezeze…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Say that again!?” Bao Tan frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, a playful laughter sounded out, “So what, did she say it? Stop losing face for your grandpa. Hurry up and f*ck off back home, okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Lei walked out form the side with a faintly smile with Xie Bian, who was in casual clothes, by his side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Esteemed Master,” Bai Rou cupped her hands towards Xie Bian. Xie Bian nodded plainly, then glanced towards Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he saw the ring on Ye Zichen’s finger, he began to smile, “We finally meet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Marshal Xie!” Ye Zichen also cupped his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Bian maintained his soft smile, then turned towards Bao Tan, “Go back. Since I’m here, even Old Leopard has to leave with me here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that so? Xie Bian, can you not be so shameless when I’m absent?”</span></p>
