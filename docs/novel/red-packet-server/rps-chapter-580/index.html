 <p><span style>Chapter 580 – Tiantian, Bluey, Tenner</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was able to clearly see what was happening in the cave using the Fiery Eyes of Truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, when he walked towards the right, he noticed that the cold aura suddenly became more intense, and there were even faint mists which blocked off his vision.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I feel like you made a not-so-smart choice,” Xuan-Yuan Xiang floated in mid-air. Even though she was in her spiritual form, she was still shuddering from the cold. On the other hand, Ye Zichen was in a slightly better position, since the armor was using up spiritual energy in order to help him guard against the cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you feel like it’s too cold, then come back,” Ye Zichen raised his arm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xuan-Yuan Xiang nodded, then disappeared. Not long later, she spoke out in Ye Zichen’s sea of consciousness, “It’s pretty warm with you, but are you really going to continue on ahead? I feel like that’s the source of the cold.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, we’ve got to kill the boss in the mission. My instinct tells me that this is the place,” Ye Zichen replied, then held Xuan-Yuan Sword closer, as he begun to walk more carefully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tap, tap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Ye Zichen walked closer and closer to the end of the cave, the sound which had attracted him in the first place became clearer and clearer. Then all of a sudden, a glimpse of a fire on his left-hand side caught his attention.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Someone’s there!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There seemed to be two figures which moved by the fire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Roar…</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the sound of a dragon’s roar echoed through the cave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Droplets of water dripped down alongside some falling rocks. Ye Zichen lifted Xuan-Yuan Sword to deflect the rocks, then when he could pay attention to other things, he noticed that a huge figure had appeared in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had two legs and a pair of wings. Its body was pitch black, with balls of blue flames on its wings.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>A winged dragon!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Roar…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dragon roared once again, and the gust of wind due to its breath sent Ye Zichen crashing into the wall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Niflheim Dragon,” Xuan-Yuan Xiang frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you make a mistake? How could there be a Niflheim Dragon here? Could it be Duan Gu’s son?” Ye Zichen was surprised.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kid, hurry up and run. We can’t beat it,” Xuan-Yuan Xiang shouted in his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen did want to run, but the winged dragon had already flapped its wings and walked in front of him, then locked him onto the ground with a claw.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Roar…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dragon let out a deafening roar. As Ye Zichen met the dragon’s cold gaze, his body began to stiffen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, some people had already finished their trial.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Some of them were even able to gain some benefits from with in the trials, so all of them had expressions of joy as they met up with their teammates.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment, the room they were in suddenly shook as if there was an earthquake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on?” Everyone frowned in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duan Hai spoke up, “It has nothing to do with you. This is caused by someone’s Hell Trail. Hurry up and get to the third stage, you don’t have much time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As everyone else begun to walk away, Gou Yuzhan clenched his fist tightly as he looked at the door. “Boss Ye…”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why is my luck so terrible? </span></i><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but retort as he looked at the winged dragon, which pinned him down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen through Xuan-Yuan Sword at the winged dragon, but it merely caused a sound when the blade collided with it, and didn’t leave any marks behind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Roar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The winged dragon howled once more, then used its wings to hit Xuan-Yuan Sword into the corner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xuan-Yuan Xiang grunted in Ye Zichen’s consciousness, causing him to quickly ask, “Are you okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just what sort of luck do you have?” Xuan-Yuan Xiang replied weakly. “This guy is seriously ridiculously strong. What looked to be a casual attack just now actually damaged my origins.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck, am I really going to get screwed here?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s eyes twitched. What was strange was that the winged dragon merely roared repeatedly and did not actually attack him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro,” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows at the winged dragon then coughed. “You don’t like you want to eat me. Indeed, I’m old and the meat’s tough, it’s not delicious at all. If you want to eat, then go and eat Xuanzang, his meat can make you truly immortal. I didn’t mean to disturb you, so how about letting me go?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Roar.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This guy doesn’t understand human speech?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen thought about it for a moment, then…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Roar…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Roar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Roar…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you doing?” Xuan-Yuan Xiang asked in his sea of consciousness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m talking with him, what else?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re an idiot,” Xuan-Yuan Xiang was speechless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re the idiot. You try and communicate with it. I’ve really ran out of ideas.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bluey, don’t mess around,” at that very moment, a childish voice sounded near Ye Zichen’s ear.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Someone’s here!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Say, you should understand what I’m saying, right? Tell this guy to get off me!” Ye Zichen shouted. Not long later, a cute and petite girl sitting on a ball of blue fire flew over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Daddy!” the little girl on the fire suddenly smiled in excitement, then jumped down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at the girl for a while…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tiantian!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bluey, move. This is my daddy,” Tiantian put her hands on her hips with a pout.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The winged dragon shrank, then silently moved his claw aside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pushed himself up, while Tiantian leaped into his arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Daddy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, after a while, Tiantian began to weep in his arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen caressed her hair, and patted her back, “Daddy’s here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, the winged dragon merely blinked on the side. When it saw Tiantian cry, it lifted its wing and slowly patted her, as if it was comforting her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A while later, Tiantian finally stopped crying, and wiped away at her dirty little face as she choked, “Mommy and Daddy were both gone. I thought you didn’t want Tiantian anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How could we not? Tiantian is daddy and mommy’s treasure. How could we not want Tiantian anymore,” Ye Zichen repeatedly comforted Tiantian and stood up from the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The winged dragon fixed its gaze onto Tiantian with care.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen carried her over to the fire, then saw Tenner sitting there playing with bricks. The bricks would occasionally fall down, and that was the sound that he had heard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh? Big Brother Ye,” Tenner looked up. When he saw Ye Zichen, he immediately pushed the bricks to the side and ran over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but shake his head. </span><i><span style>I didn’t expect Tiantian to end up staying with Soul Pearl Yiyuan.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Tenner, you really didn’t lie to me. Daddy really came!” Tiantian giggled in Ye Zichen’s arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was stunned for a moment, then raised his eyebrows, “Tiantian, you can see him?”</span></p>
 <p></p>
