 <p><span style>Chapter 33 – It was me finding you</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Xiao Hai had helped him out so much, Ye Zichen felt that he should quickly return the favor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He clicked open the WeChat group, and saw that the legend of his flame war with Erlang Shen back in the days was still being talked about.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Some deities that didn’t know what happened would ask curiously. It seemed like even deities were like that, gossips were never-ending.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: That deity appeared for a brief moment like an epiphyllum, then was never heard from again after the flame war with Erlang Shen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: Yeah, that deity is the idol of many of my good sisters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Barefoot Immortal: Daring to fight against True Lord Erlang, then he definitely is this. &lt;insert three thumb up emojis&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: Agree.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Agree +1</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Gang: Agree +2,</span></p>
 <p><span style>The group instantly heated up. Ye Zichen could only helplessly quit the chat group and clicked on his chat with the Monkey King.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not finding him around the chat group these past few days was kind of out of character for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thinking about that, Ye Zichen sent a greeting over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great Sage, what are you getting busy with?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>No reply!</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was too weird, he would always instantly reply before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s phone suddenly vibrated, causing him to open the group chat like it was a conditioned reflex.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A red packet suddenly appeared, and the person that sent it was actually Old Lord Taishang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Snatch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was too late, the red packets had ran out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap. He slapped his thigh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the red packet by Old Lord Taishang. That was exactly what Ye Zichen needed. Crap, he didn’t manage to get any.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked at the other people’s luck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>F*ck, it really was more Great Recovery Pills.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Another red packet was sent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sorry, the red packets ran out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, another red packet appeared</span></p>
 <p><span style>Snatch!</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received Old Lord Taishang’s red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Great Recovery Pill x3.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Got it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s body shuddered, he had finally gotten it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he was a bit curious, why had Old Lord Taishang started sending red packets without saying anything? Furthermore, why were they sent at such a large rate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most importantly, the group was terrifyingly silent. No one actually spoke at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was only able to find out about the situation after scrolling up the chat log.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang: Wait a moment, our salaries’ are here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Salaries’ are here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who was confused, suddenly remembered what the Great Sage has said. The Great Recovery Pills Old Lord Taishang had refined were all given to the heavenly soldiers as candy.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So that’s what’s going on.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>So that meant, wouldn’t there be more…</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he expected, Old Lord Taishang sent ten-odd red packets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen furiously tried to snatch them, but it was unable to get a single one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, why do you keep playing with your phone?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei sat nearby. Ye Zichen waved his phone in front of her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Snatching red packets.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hehe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei couldn’t help but giggle, “Just how poor are you? If you really don’t have any money, then I can give you some.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Xiao Yumei was about to give her card to him. However, Ye Zichen quickly pushed the card back to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you doing? Is this you trying to support me? Don’t you forget, your money was all earned from my stone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, our family’s Zichen is so amazing,” Xiao Yumei smiled. All of a sudden, Ye Zichen was a bit mesmerized, while his hand also started to reach uncontrollably into Xiao Yumei’s clothes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop messing around, Tiantian’s still here,” Xiao Yumei swatted his hand away, while Ye Zichen scratched his head and smiled apologetically. However, Xiao Yumei then whispered in his ear, “Come to my place later tonight.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the force in his body instantly surged out. As Ye Zichen watched Xiao Yumei’s teasing eyes, she quickly gulped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Daddy, Mommy, Tiantian is full.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was unknown why this Lil’ Tiantian would always pop up at times like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re full, then Mommy will bring Tiantian to wash her hands,” Xiao Yumei threw Ye Zichen an alluring smile right before she walked out with Tiantian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This siren…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they left the restaurant, the manager and waiters all lined up in a row to send Ye Zichen off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t stand that at all, while Xiao Yumei seemed to act natural.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was clear that she was already used to this sort of situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go to my home?” Xiao Yumei smiled towards Ye Zichen, while her alluring eyes were filled with faint anticipation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you think?” Ye Zichen held her waist without any hesitation. </span><i><span style>Man, if I don’t go with you seducing me like that, could &nbsp;I still be called a man?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, unfortunately, the big bro of his dorm, Kang Peng, called.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hello, are there any issues? If there aren’t, then I’m hanging up!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ugh, calling at this time, isn’t this causing trouble for him!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi, hurry up and come back. If you don’t, then I’m dead.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kang Peng sobbed in the phone, as if he was being beaten.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen scanned Xiao Yumei’s face, then listened back to Kang Peng’s suffering on the phone…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I’ll be there immediately.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The second floor of Oben Network Café, hurry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen threw his phone into his pocket. Just as he was about to explain to Xiao Yumei, she already spoke up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you have some urgent matters?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A bro at the dorm seems to have gotten into some trouble, I’m going over to see what’s going on,” Ye Zichen scratched his head. Then wiped his finger across Xiao Yumei’s cheek. “Next time, I’ll come to your home, okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you have matters to attend to then go, I’m yours, you can come by any time,” Xiao Yumei smiled, kissed Ye Zichen’s lips lightly, then got into the car.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen touched his lips that still had a faint aroma left and let out a long sigh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t get into trouble earlier or later, it just had to be right now…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He urgently arrived at the second floor of Oben Network Café. Most of the students here right now were university students nearby, everyone sat on their seats playing their games, it didn’t look like they were in a fight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen scanned the second floor, and saw that Kang Peng was playing intensely on the second computer beside the window.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Smach.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen slapped Kang Peng’s headphones off with a slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That grandson… Ye-zi, you came back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kang Peng scratched his head and smiled idiotically. Ye Zichen was about to explode from anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he heard Kang Peng sob in the phone, he thought Kang Peng had been beaten up!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The f*ck? Tricking him?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It was fine if it was normally, but just now…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clenched his teeth and fists, while the veins on his forehead were about to pop up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You, better give me a satisfied explanation, or else…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kang Peng gulped when he saw Ye Zichen clench his fists, and said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It wasn’t me looking for you, it was someone else.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who, tell me who was looking for me,” Ye Zichen glared, and grabbed Kang Peng’s collar. “Do you f*cking know how important the business that got messed up was for laozi? Do you know how important of a matter I gave up to come back!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi, don’t be impulsive, calm down.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kang Peng told Ye Zichen to not get angry, and pointed over at an empty computer beside him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She’s looking for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A peal of clear laughter sounded out from behind Ye Zichen. He turned around and saw Xia Keke standing behind him with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It was me looking for you!”</span></p>
