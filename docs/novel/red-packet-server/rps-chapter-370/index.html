 <p><span style>Chapter 370 – The Underworld’s Trouble</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the Underworld.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within the Yama Hall that King Chujiang was in charge of.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, King Chujiang was looking at the large pile of paperwork in front of him with a frown. </span><i><span style>I wonder what’s going on recently, there has been a lot more work for the Underworld. But all of these dead people cried out their innocence when they arrived at the Ten Yama Halls.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Judge Cui was beyond busy due to the workload, and the same applied to the Ten Yama Kings. All of the ghost servants from the Underworld were also all sent out to capture the ghosts, while the eighteen layers of hell were almost completely filled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within the Yama King’s chat group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Pingdeng: Old Brothers, I’m already tired to no end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Yanluo: This is a bit strange, why did we suddenly get so much more work? My Yama Hall’s ghost servants have all been sent out, but they are still unable to capture all of the ghosts in my area. Requesting help.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Qinguang: My area isn’t particularly busy. I’ll send some people over to help.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Yanluo: Oh, thank you so much.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang had wanted to speak up in the group as well, but just as he was about to send a message, his phone rang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He left the chat group page, and when he saw the person who sent him the message…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gulp.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why did this guy come asking?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang licked his lips, then immediately entered the group to seek help once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang: @everyone. Guys, that guy came to find me again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Lunhui: Which one?</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Yanluo: @King Chujiang, what are you talking about. Oh yeah, are you busy? Lend me some reapers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang: I’m pretty busy over here as well. I’ve sent them all out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Qinguang: Which guy? Is it him?</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang: Yes, it’s the one who saved you, Big Brother. The last few times he came to find me, he wanted me to add some life span to people. I already added lifespan so many times, what if he asks me to do so again… Wouldn’t the Heavenly Court cause trouble for me!?</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Qinguang: Don’t forget about that master’s identity. He might very well be the reincarnation of the Yellow Emperor. We have to treat him well. Hurry up and reply. If there is something that you can’t &nbsp;do, then say it in the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang: Alright then!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He left the group screen once again, then silently prayed as he gulped.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Master, please don’t make me add anymore lifespan. Anything else is fine!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang pursed his lips, then made up his mind to reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master, what sort of business do you have with this one?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Ye Zichen was already extremely impatient due to all the waiting. It was fortunate that King Chujiang had replied before his patience ran out, otherwise, Ye Zichen would have started cursing again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I naturally found you because I have business with you. Do you still remember the secret art of revival a person who died before her time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, of course. Do you need this little one to repeat it for you?” King Chujiang typed out his reply with a coy smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need, I came to find you this time to inform you that I have gathered everything. Hurry up and open the gates of the Underworld for me. I’m going to revive that person!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen said rather urgently, but King Chujiang was completely stunned.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Gathered everything.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>The items required to revive a person who died before their time are all extremely hard to find treasures. If it was used on a normal person, then it might actually create an Immortal.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>This master actually gathered everything, and from the looks of it, he doesn’t feel pained over the treasures at all!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Master… Are-Are you sure you gathered everything? The celestial pill, Nine-Heart Lotus Root, Thousand-Year Dragon Eye and Holy Water of Yiyuan… Are you sure you gathered all that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No shit, if I hadn’t, then would I come look for you? Hurry up and open the gates for me. Hurry, hurry!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen continuously hurried him. King Chujiang swipe the seat from his forehead, before running back to the group for backup.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang: @everyone. Brothers, help!</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Qinguang: What did that master say?</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang: That master told me to open the gates linking the Underworld and mortal realm. He wants to come over!</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Pingdeng: What is he coming over for?</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang: Didn’t I tell you guys before? That master wants to revive someone who died before their time. He has already gathered all the treasures, so he wants to come over to revive the person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Yanluo: Awesome!</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Lunhui: 666!</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Songdi: This master is too amazing, he actually gathered everything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang: Guys, stop exclaiming here. That master is waiting for us to reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Qinguang: Don’t let the master down, at least, not currently. The Underworld is overly chaotic right now, if we recklessly open the gates of the underworld, then the vengeful ghosts might sneak out. If they harm the mortal realm, then it will be our wrongdoing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang: Then what do you think I should do?</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Qinguang: I’ll go and speak to that master.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, King Qinguang left the group, then sent a message to Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen did not expect King Qinguang to seek him out when King Chujiang didn’t reply for a long time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened? King Chujiang asked you to come and speak to me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kind of!” King Qinguang answered. “Master has managed to gather all of the necessary items for revival, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master, here’s the issue. The Underworld is recently in some trouble, so we can’t open the gates linking the mortal realm and the Underworld. If you are not in a hurry, then can you wait a while…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You guys are the ones who said that you can open the gates, and now you’re saying that you can’t!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen laughed coldly, then sent a voice message to King Qinguang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think that the Underworld is intentionally making it hard for this sovereign, right!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within the Yama Hall, a voice filled with rage sounded out, causing the ghosts servants within the hall to be scared senseless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Qinguang also opened his eyes wide in shock.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Laws of the World.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I didn’t expect this master to actually be an expert who has gotten a glimpse of the Laws of the World. </span></i><span style>Thinking that, King Qinguang immediately acted more subserviently. He got off his throne, and bowed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master, please cease your rage. Since you can peek into the Laws of the World, then you naturally know the situation of the Underworld. We truly are not lying to you. Please cease your rage!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>An indifferent cold snort sounded out, causing King Qinguang to quickly bow again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Ye Zichen also spoke up, “Did the Underworld get into some sort of trouble?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We don’t know why there is a large number of ghosts, who have died due to injustice. Some of these ghosts were bearing grudges as well, so they turned into vengeful ghosts. The Underworld is investigating this right now. After we find out, we’ll immediately open the gates for you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A large number of ghosts who died to injustice suddenly appeared!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Qinguang replied, “Indeed. It is also rather strange, because all of them have lost a spiritual and a physical soul, while the way they died is extremely suspicious!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh?” Ye Zichen replied in surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, King Qinguang actually managed to muster up his courage out of nowhere and directly asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master, I wonder if you can lend the Underworld a hand!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Qinguang’s words stunned Ye Zichen as well, but he still asked with interest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you want me to help you with?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Investigate this situation!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Qinguang squinted his eyes and typed out his reply. This issue had already took up too much of their time, but no matter how they investigated, they were unable to find out the reason behind this.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Since this master has already peaked into the Laws of the World, then…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, but… what do I gain from that?”</span></p>
