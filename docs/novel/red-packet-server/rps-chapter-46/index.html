 <p><span style>Chapter 46 – Huge Scene!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Differences settled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen walked back to the barbeque store shoulder to shoulder with Su Yan. Old Man Su sat on the chair and swept his gaze playfully on the two of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The couple got back together?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Ye Zichen knew that Old Man Su wanted to get him and Su Yan together, he didn’t think that he would say something that was so very obvious.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>More importantly, why did Old Man Su want to do that?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Purely for the monkey wine?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>If it’s like that, then Su Yan’s was truly too little.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thankfully the person that offered the monkey wine was him. If it was anyone else, he would definitely cry in the bathroom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Su Yan’s beautiful face was completely red. She bit her lips and pouted as she slammed the table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you say anything like that again, then I won’t sneak you out anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aigo, grandpa spoke to much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Man Su chuckled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After eating for another half an hour or so, Old Man Su was also satisfied, so they prepared to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big bro, that brat seems to be the Ye Zichen that Young Master Fu talked about!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A red-hair underling pointed towards Ye Zichen, while five or six young man immediately came over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, you don’t say. It really is.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The bald big bro touched his shining bald head, and revealed a savage smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Our fortune is pretty good, we actually directly met the business we were looking for.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, you damn scoundrel, they’re looking for you!” Liu Qing, who was floating in midair, shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Ye, they are looking for you?” Old Man Su also frowned slightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Su Yan didn’t speak up, it was obvious that there was more worry for Ye Zichen in her eyes than anyone else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brat, you are Ye Zichen, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The baldie touched the thick golden chain on his neck, opened his mouth full of yellow teeth and walked towards Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stood his ground without moving. It seemed like Fu Chengming had tasked these people with the job of dealing with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t think that Fu Chengming would have acted this quick!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen replied indifferently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, not bad, you dare to admit it,” the baldie touched his bold head and said. “Young Master Fu wants us to break one of your legs, look…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young man, this is a lawful society. Aren’t you afraid of the law punishing you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Man Su couldn’t quite accept it, and spoke up. When the baldie heard this, he laughed maniacally.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old fellow, you actually dared to speak about the law with laozi? I’m telling you, laozi is the law around here. What laozi says is the same as the emperor’s orders. Hold that brat!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can’t do this, otherwise, we’ll call the police.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan immediately jumped out due to her being worried for Ye Zichen’s safety. When the baldie saw Su Yan, his gaze sharpened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I never would have thought that there’s a girlie here. What, this gigolo is your man? You’re worried about him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The baldie reached out his hand to touch Su Yan’s cheeks. Seeing that, Ye Zichen, who was unmoving during all this, took out a beer bottle on the table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang!</span></p>
 <p><span style>And directly slammed it on his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you not believe that I will break your four limbs if you dare to touch her!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brat, you are seeking death!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems like you don’t believe it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had smiled kindly, but soon, it turned extremely sharp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He raised his leg and kicked the baldie’s stomach. </span><i><span style>F*ck, this grandson actually wanted to touch Su Yan.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Su Yan is his woman, he will murder anyone who dared to touch her.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you blanking out for? Go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The baldie, who slammed onto the lamppost, roared angrily at his underlings. Ye Zichen picked up the beer bottle that was smashed, as a golden light arose from his eyes, and snorted coldly at the baldie’s underlings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stand still if you don’t want to die.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they saw Ye Zichen’s faint golden eyes, the underlings instantly dumbed out on spot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you know that the thing you shouldn't have done most was to touch her?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stabbed the shattered parts of the beer bottle into the positon of the baldie’s collar bone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Actually I didn’t want to use violence in front of Elder Su and Su Yan, but why did you have to touch her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen swung a fist on the baldie’s face, instantly transforming the right half of his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh yeah, I said that I will break your four limbs…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stepped heavily onto the baldie’s left arm, resulting a clear crack of the bones to be heard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That pitiful smile caused everyone to be shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry up and call the police, a death might happen later.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The customers in the barbeque started to call the police.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Old Man Su had a call.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dad, why did you sneak out again, and you even left your security behind. Where are you now, I’ll come and get you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, where am I? I’m being surrounded by a group of delinquents. Just now, that delinquent leader also nearly took advantage of my darling granddaughter. Su Qihu, do as you see fit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slam.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Su furiously hung up the phone, then sat down and looked towards Ye Zichen’s position.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For some reason, he had started to like Ye Zichen a bit more.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He was harsh and merciless enough when he moved. He was truly talented!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It seems like he had to find a way to trick him to his side, that sort of talented person would only have a good future ahead him!</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, Elder Su looked towards Su Yan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he saw Su Yan’s nervous expression…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Su instantly felt like it was all set.</span></p>
 <p><span style>WEEoooWEEoooWEEooo…</span></p>
 <p><span style>A loud police siren rang out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t move, put your hands up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A clear voice sounded out behind Ye Zichen, causing him to casually throw the baldie, who was half dead, onto the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen turned around, and couldn’t help but shake his head with a smile when he saw the female officer with a gun.</span></p>
 <p><span style> “Officer Lin, we really are destined to meet each other.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He counted the number of police cars that had been driven over. There was eight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They really did think highly of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s you again, I knew we would meet again,” Officer Lin smiled coldly and waved towards the police behind her, signaling them to arrest Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled, indicating that they needn’t be in such a hurry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Officer Lin frowned, then yelled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What sort of tricks do you want to play now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen walked a few steps backwards with a smile, and arrived beside the baldie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The baldie’s eyes became filled with terror when he saw that Ye Zichen had returned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t you still have a leg that’s not broken? Don’t worry, I’ll break it for you now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen! Put your hands up, otherwise, I’m going to shoot!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Officer Lin roared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry, he won’t die.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You actually dare to assault the victim in front of me. I guess you were looking down on me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t take it so seriously, it hurts your feelings, aren’t I right?” The corner of Ye Zichen’s mouth rose as he pointed at the baldie on the floor. “I said that I will break his four limbs from the start. A person has to keep his promise, and break it when I say so. Otherwise, how am I supposed to go around if I left a leg for him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is truly too much. Arrest him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Officer Lin roared. However, Elder Su, who has been sitting on the chair stood up and snorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to see who dares.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ten odd military keeps stopped outside the barbeque store, while men wearing military uniforms walked down from the car with a stern expression and ran in front of Old Man Su and lined up in an orderly manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Report! The guard company has assembled!” </span></p>
