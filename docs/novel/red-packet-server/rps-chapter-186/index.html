 <p><span style>Chapter 186 – 90-10 Split</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hu-ge, you’re so funny. Do you think we’re people that don’t abide by the law?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei pursed her lips and smiled, then looked towards Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen reached his hand into his pocket, then took out a flaming red pill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is…” Li Minghu asked in a testing manner. He was unable to tell what that was just from appearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When we called you, I asked Hu-ge to find a heavily injured subordinate. Did you manage to find one?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, he’s inside,” Li Minghu nodded, then he looked at the pill in Ye Zichen’s hand. “What medicine is this? What effects does it have!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s useless to say it now, since there’s no proof. How about we go in and let the injured subordinate have a try?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, please!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they entered the car shop, they saw that the first floor wasn’t any different from a normal car shop, while the second floor served as Li Minghu’s base.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was different from Ye Zichen’s imagination. It wasn’t all smoky everywhere, and it also lacked the mountains of trash that he thought would be there!</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the contrary, the clean second floor had some gym equipment that quite a few of Li Minghu’s subordinates were using.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was even a very eye-catching plate at the door!</span></p>
 <p><span style>No smoking!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Bro!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Li Minghu appeared, the subordinates all stopped what they were doing and greeted him. From the looks of it, he was very popular among these people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These included the delinquents that Li Minghu had scolded earlier. There was a small table with paper, pen and a very thin book in front of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The book should be the so called Code of Conduct Manual.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do what you should be doing. One of you go and push Ol’ Three to the VIP room.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Li Minghu opened the door to a room facing the staircase, “These two bosses, please!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The facilities of the room were very simple. There were several sofas, a tea table, a fridge and an ash tray.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Minghu took out three bottles of water and placed it onto the table with a smile, “I, Tiger, don’t understand tea, nor do I drink coffee. So please don’t mind the water.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hu-ge is funny,” Ye Zichen and Xiao Yumei sat down together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Li Minghu also looked at the pill with squinted eyes, “These two bosses, can you guys tell me about this medicine…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hu-ge, don’t be anxious, you’ll know when the time comes,” Xiao Yumei smiled, causing Li Minghu to scratch his head and lean back on the sofa.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was a very curious person, so just withholding the information from him like that really caused him to feel uncomfortable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I, Tiger, will have to say the displeasing words first. Please don’t let this medicine hurt a person’s bodily functions. My subordinate is innocent. If anything happens to him after taking this medicine, then I, Tiger, will take revenge on the two of you even if I have to do it with my life.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hu-ge truly cares about your subordinates.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Loyalty is most important if one wants to stay in this industry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Li Minghu finished, a knock on the door to the VIP room sounded out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come in!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, the VIP room door was pushed open and a young man pushed a wheelchair in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A man with his four limbs covered in plaster and his face wrapped in several layers of bandages sat on the wheelchair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, Third Bro is here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, go on and leave us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Minghu waved towards that subordinate, then stood up from the sofa to push the wheelchair over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My Third Little Bro, his four limbs were fractured…” With that, he turned towards the person on the wheelchair, “Third Little Bro, say allow to Boss Xiao and Boss Ye.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiao… It actually is you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person on the wheelchair suddenly moved erratically.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clearly felt the hostility towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He carefully observed the person on the wheelchair…</span></p>
 <p><span style>A meaningful smile surfaced on Ye Zichen’s face. He really didn’t expect that the person he had broken the four limbs on was actually Li Minghu’s Third Little Bro.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What made him even more speechless was that he had personally broken his limbs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now, he was going to personally put the pill into his mouth to help him recover.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You two…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Minghu was able to stay in the industry for so long by relying on his brain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He could already feel something unusual from the words between the two.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We kind of know each other. I am the one who broke his arms and legs,” Ye Zichen said without any hesitation. When he saw that Li Minghu’s expression turned a bit dark, he immediately added. “I had a reason for hitting him, but I shouldn’t say it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m worried that Boss Hu would be troubled if I say it. He broke your regulations!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Minghu’s expression tensed while Baldie didn’t dare to say anything more. After all, he did break the regulations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen handed the pill in his hand over when he saw their expression, “Let him eat it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This isn’t poison, right?” Li Minghu squinted his eyes. Ye Zichen had a grudge with his Third Little Bro…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not that bored,” Ye Zichen reached out his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Minghu picked up the pill from Ye Zichen’s hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Open your mouth. Don’t be scared. If anything happens, Big Bro will take revenge for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He put the pill into Baldie’s mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In less than a minute, Baldie suddenly screamed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Mingfu slammed down on the table. At the same time, the door to the VIP room was pushed open, and a bunch of his subordinates stood at the entrance with weapons in their hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It feels great…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Baldie, who was screaming, let out a long sigh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, he stood up from the wheelchair and threw the plaster onto the floor with force.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Amazing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Minghu looked at everything in shock!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What… All of you, go out!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Minghu roared at the doorway, causing the subordinates outside to quickly shut the door to the VIP room. Meanwhile, Baldie also waved his arms around in excitement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ol’ Three, you’ve healed!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah!” Baldie answered excitedly. “This is so f*cking weird. After taking the pill, I felt like my body was really warm, then not long later, my limbs were filled with energy, so I wanted to stand up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Ye!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Hu sees the effect, right?” Xiao Yumei giggled on the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s too f*cking amazing, this pill doesn’t have any side effects, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nope!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gulp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Minghu furiously gulped. This pill was definitely a miracle, if he could really advertise it, then it wouldn’t be long until he goes legal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir, Madam, your medicine…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Hu, ask what you should, and don’t ask about what you shouldn’t. Go by the rules!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pursed his lips and smiled, while Li Minghu also laughed coyly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He also knew that his words just now were too intrusive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry, sorry. I, Tiger, said the wrong thing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No worries!” Ye Zichen raised his hand with a kind smile. “I wonder if Boss Hu is interested in cooperation?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, naturally. But before that, should we talk about the split of profit!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ninety-Ten!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s too little, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Hu, don’t be too greedy,” Ye Zichen squinted his eyes and he knocked on the tea table with his fingers. “You are just providing the sales channel. This is already a lot for that. If we talk about it with others…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright! Ten percent, I, Tiger, am doing it!”</span></p>
