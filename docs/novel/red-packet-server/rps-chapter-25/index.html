 <p><span style>Chapter 25 – Let him go</span></p>
 <p><span style>The lights of the interrogation room fell onto Ye Zichen’s face. Since the light made him a bit uncomfortable, Ye Zichen blinked a few times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slam..</span></p>
 <p><span style>The female officer walked in from outside the interrogation room and slammed her notebook onto the table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Admit it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Ye Zichen looked up, he didn’t think that the female officer would bring him here just like that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He glanced at the female’s officer’s face. The officer was rather pretty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had a slender face and long black hair that was tied into a ponytail. The coldness of her expression did not affect her beauty at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Officer, I have nothing to admit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, you’re being troublesome,” the corner of the officer’s mouth rose. Then she opened the notebook and took out her pen to start an official interrogation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Name.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Officer, when you are asking for someone’s name, shouldn’t you say yours first?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows and smiled, causing the female officer to slam down on the table try to shock him a little.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you not believe that I will throw you into prison in the name of the obstruction of justice?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why so angry!?” Ye Zichen twitched his mouth. “At least tell me your surname.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lin.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, Officer Lin, I’m called Ye Zichen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Age.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Twenty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gender.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…” Ye Zichen stopped. He couldn’t help but think of that answer that people were already sick of.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How about I take it out for you to see?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Take it out yourself to see.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Officer Lin didn’t answer at all. Ye Zichen had thought that he could cause her to be angry just like in novels, but she just directly hit the ball back into his court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Male.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did you hit him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Officer Lin, you really are sort of falsely accusing me. The fatty already told you personally that he tripped, what right do you have to be framing me, and saying that I hit him?” Ye Zichen said with a helpless expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, don’t pretend to be innocent. The reason the victim said that might very well be due to being threatened beforehand. Don’t try to go around circles with me, just directly admit it,” Officer’s Lin’s eyes stared straight at Ye Zichen, as if it was going to go through his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn’t hit him,” Since he was going to resist, Ye Zichen planned resist to the end. If he admitted it, he would have to be detained for at least half a month.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How long do think you can pretend for? We have already sent the victim to the hospital, with our protection, the victim will point you out in no time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I just didn’t do it,” Ye Zichen decided to act shameless with her, and stared at Officer Lin’s chest. “36C, they’re very big.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Officer Lin slammed the notebook onto the table and stood up. Ye Zichen also opened his eyes wide then shrank backwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What, the police are going hit people?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, hitting you is hitting scum at most!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Officer Lin cracked her knuckles, and approached Ye Zichen with a cold expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The police are going to hit someone…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Susu, sorry, Riche Bro was brought to the police station since he was helping me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke pouted pitifully as she called. The person on the other side of the call momentarily blanked out, then said worriedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then how is he?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know, but that police lady looked so mean, I don’t know if Riche Bro will suffer inside.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, I understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slam.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The call ended. Xia Keke stood outside the police station and looked inside a few times. Then, after a bit of hesitation, she dialed a number.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Officer Lin, don’t forget your identity. Even if I am a suspect, you can’t use violence against me, otherwise, I’ll get my lawyer to file a lawsuit against your police station.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen gulped and warned with an intent of threatening her. God only knows what this crazy woman was going to do to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was still handcuffed, even if he got beaten, he could only take it forcefully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry, we have a lot of ways to make you hurt, but unable to get any wounds that can be detected,” Officer Lin was like a little devil as she approached Ye Zichen step by step.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the moment she raised her hand, Ye Zichen suddenly submitted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll admit it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, wouldn’t it be fine if you admitted it from the start,” Officer Lin sat back down with a proud smile. “Say it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Officer Lin picked up the pen, the door to the interrogation room was banged open.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Captain Lin, there’s a call.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m interrogating a suspect.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The commissioner called.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Officer Lin threw the pen to the side angrily and snorted, “Wait for me to deal with you when I get back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Commissioner.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Lin, did we arrest a gentleman with the surname Ye?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Officer Lin’s expression tensed up after hearing that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The tone of the other person clearly stopped a bit, then said anxiously continued, “Hurry up and let that Mr. Ye go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But he intentionally…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothing, Lil’ Lin, this is the orders from the higher-up. Furthermore, the military had also just asked us to release that very same Mr. Ye, do you understand!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Officer Lin hesitated a long time as she held the phone, then she couldn’t help but sigh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Officer Lin hung up the call and looked at the police officer beside her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did the victim say?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The victim is determined to say that he tripped and that it has nothing to do with the suspect.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let him go!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen walked out of the room in a carefree manner, then before leaving, he ran in front of Officer Lin in a low manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Beauty, I’m going. Don’t miss me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t let me catch you again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, don’t be so angry. They say if a woman gets angry easily, then she’ll bleed too much in her time of the month.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen made a face at Officer Lin, causing her to clench her teeth in anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she looked at Ye Zichen’s cocky image, Officer Linn couldn’t help but clench her fist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Find all the information we have on Ye Zichen and bring it to my office.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s mood could only be described by one word after leaving the police station.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Amazing!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Riche Bro.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke, who had been waiting outside the police station, leaped into Ye Zichen’s arms. Ye Zichen subconsciously caught her, and saw that the loli in his arms was already crying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You scared me so much…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It was no big deal, why is your mental capability so weak? I really don’t know how you got into Master.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This lady… did it… through skill!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke instantly put on a strong and tsundere face when LoL was brought up, but she still stuttered as she wept.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, alright, it’s through skill. Keke’s League skills are the best.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke sniffed and looked up. She looked blankly at Ye Zichen’s smiling face, then tipped up on her toes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Smooch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A pair of warm and wet lips landed on Ye Zichen’s cheek. When he turned around in shock, he saw Xia Keke giggling as she wiped away her tears.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is this lady’s first kiss. We don’t owe each other anything now. No blackmailing me with this in the future.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s heart jumped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thinking about the girl’s kiss, Xia Keke can’t have also gotten a marriage string with him, right?</span></p>
