 <p><span style>Chapter 142 – Ripping Han Ziangzi apart</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zichen laughed softly as he helped Ye Rong clean up the table after breakfast, “Mom, I’ll cook for you when I have some free time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You?” Mother Ye displayed a look of disdain. “You’ve said this before, but think about the results…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Ye Zichen immediately revealed a look of awkwardness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he cooked in the past, he had nearly burnt the house down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it was different now, he had the God of Food’s experiences.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just how long ago was that? If you don’t believe me, then I’ll find time to show you. It definitely isn’t going to be any worse than the chefs in 5-star hotels.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Never mind.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mother Ye clearly treated Ye Zichen’s words as a joke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Tiantian had already put on her small backpack in the living room. Seeing that, Ye Rong dried her hands and pointed at the dishes in the sink, “Wash these remaining dishes, I’m going to take Tiantian to school.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bye-bye daddy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ Tiantian waved towards him with a sweet smile. After sending Mother Ye and Tiantian off from the mansion, Ye Zichen quickly finished washing the dishes, then sat on the living room sofa.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at his phone habitually to see if anyone sent a red packet in the chat group, as well as to see what the deities were talking about recently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, when he opened up WeChat, he saw that there was a red “1” in his friend list.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Xiangzi has sent a friend request.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Han Xiangzi of the Eight Immortals!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>What did Han Xiangzi add him for? Did Immortal Lady He really think that he wanted to chat her up, and told Han Xiangzi about it?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he definitely can’t add him, something bad will happen if he does!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, at the Eight Immortals Manor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Xiangzi stared at the WeChat on his phone with red eyes. When </span><span style>Lü</span><span style> Dongbin saw that Han Xiangzi was still staring at the screen, even though he had already finished practicing a set of sword techniques, so he couldn’t help but walk over and pat Han Xiangzi’s shoulders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ol’ Han, you’ve been staring at the screen for several hours already.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I must confront the brat the moment he accepts.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Xiangzi panted. Immortal Lady He was his crush. Sky Sovereign Nameless actually wanted to cockold him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>If this can be tolerated, then what can’t be!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Even if the uncle can tolerate it, the aunt can’t! </span></i><span style><span><a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is no need to do this, in Immortal Lady’s heart, she…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lü Dongbin wanted to speak, but then he stopped himself. Since they, the Eight Immortals have become deities for so long, they know all about each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortal Lady He and Han Xiangzi did have a period of an ambiguous and affable relationship while they were in the mortal realm, but after they became deities, everyone knew that it was impossible for them to be together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even so, I still have to confront him,” Han Xiangzi answered stubbornly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lü Dongbin shook his head. He wasn’t sure how to advise Han Xiangzi in this situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Lan Caihe also walked over, “Does Immortal Lady know?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She…” Han Xiangzi paused, then shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lü Dongbin and Lan Caihe both sighed softly. Meanwhile, Iron Crutch Li walked over with a large wine gourd.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That newly ascended deity didn’t add you yet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nope,” Han Xiangzi shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Iron Crutch Li raised his eyebrows, “Then I’ll add him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ol’ Li,” Lü Dongbin frowned. Since they, the Eight Immortals had a high position in the Heavenly Court, he didn’t mind Han Xiangzi messing around. However, why did Iron Crutch Li, the steadfast one, also and and started messing around as well?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ol’ Han is already like this. He definitely would feel reluctant if he can’t manage to add him. We’ll just add the person and chat. Even if that great deity really turns unhappy, we’ll just apologize.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Iron Crutch Li clicked on Ye Zichen’s profile pic in the WeChat group and sent the friend request.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, there wasn’t any new news in the Heavenly Court’s group, it was just the normal chitchat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen took a look at the moments. Yue Lao was definitely a dutiful agent. Yue Lao would post something new every 5 minutes, much more frequent than all of the WeChat merchants in Ye Zichen’s friend list.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s phone vibrated, so he left his moments.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Another “1” popped up in his friend list.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Iron Crutch Li has sent a friend request.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen felt a bit speechless as he looked at the friend request. The Eight Immortals are relentless, are they trying to bully him using their numbers!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What a joke! I, Ye Zichen, am still someone with a reputation in the Heavenly Court.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I won’t let you bully me like this.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Accept!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He’ll just find Erlang Shen if anything happens!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, he added me,” Iron Crutch Li, who was holding a large wine gourd, smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Xiangzi immediately snatched over the phone, “I’m Han Xiangzi!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes in annoyance when he saw the message.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>How could laozi not know that you’re Han Xiangzi.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Then he looked at the intimacy level!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Friendly!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It makes sense. Iron Crutch Li might be friendly, but Han Xiangzi’s should be cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since you’re cold towards me, then I can’t be nice to you either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm? What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just look at how cocky this brat is! Isn’t he just a newly ascendant celestial sovereign? He dares to speak like this to us, the Eight Immortals. He definitely doesn’t take us seriously,” Han Xiangzi said angrily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, everyone around him ignored him, and just carried on with whatever they were doing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fine, you really are my good brothers,” Han Xiangzi glared at them hatefully, then sent another message on the phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you know what I sought you out for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How do I know what you sought this sovereign out for? This sovereign is very busy, just say whatever you have to say.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>You’re pissing me off!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>You’re pissing me off!!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>If the phone didn’t belong to Iron Crutch Li, Han Xiangzi might have directly thrown the phone onto the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brat, I don’t care how high your newly ascended celestial sovereign position is. Don’t forget, we’re the Eight Immortals!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eight Immortals, so?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When we became immortals, you were probably staying in a hole somewhere!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So what? This sovereign is currently a celestial sovereign living with Taibai Jinxing. Do you, the Eight Immortals, have a hall in the Heavenly Court?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Buzz….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Huang Yi called. Ye Zichen immediately picked up the phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen-ge, I-I-I…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but smile when he heard Huang Yi’s extreme excitement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can stand up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In ten-odd years, Huang Yi had never known what it meant to walk ever since he was born.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had thought that he would have to spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair. However, Ye Zichen’s appearance changed his entire life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen-ge, thank you so much,” Ye Zichen could hear tears from Huang Yi’s tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen comforted him understandingly, “This is great news, what are you crying for? Does your sister know that you can stand up now…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She knows, she…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen heard Huang Shengmei’s joyous weeping, he let out a sigh, then shrugged, “Haha, tell your sister to stop crying. I’m coming over to your place right now to do a checkup for you. Then we’ll go out and eat. Just treat it as a celebration for you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the call ended, Ye Zichen took a look at the chat, and saw that Han Xiangzi’s messages had covered the screen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was more or less just him speaking about how amazing they, the Eight Immortals are.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes when he saw this, then casually replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This sovereign has to go out to attend to matters. Let’s chat when I’ve got time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen exited WeChat with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Han Xiangzi, who was in the Eight Immortals Manor, saw this…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slam.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He directly chucked the phone onto the floor, causing it to completely shatter!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s pissing me off!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slam.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Xiangzi instantly felt a stick hit the back of his waist. When he turned around, he saw Iron Crutch Li, who was carrying a wine gourd and a golden crutch, tremble in anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Laozi’s phone!”</span></p>
