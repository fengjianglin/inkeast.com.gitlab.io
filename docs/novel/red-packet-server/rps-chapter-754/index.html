 <p><span style>Chapter 754 – That’s where my home is</span></p>
 <p><span style>Don’t trust you.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a straightforward phrase and one that Ye Zichen could only nod understandingly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was completely normal for Jade Emperor to have his reservations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was something very clear from the prior situation. Jade Emperor gave those orders to capture Ye Zichen, but no deity stood forth to do so.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ignoring the fact that some of them were not strong enough to capture Ye Zichen, what truly disappointed the Jade Emperor was the fact that they didn’t even have the slightest desire to follow those orders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, when he acted as if he was going to take down all the deities, the deities actually wanted to turn on him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s what truly disappointed him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And that terrified him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since everyone in the Heavenly Court had taken Ye Zichen’s side recently, he was considering eliminating the threat before he leaves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then just kill me now,” Ye Zichen shrugged. “Nobody else is here. Killing me here and now will put an end to it all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you think I won’t do that?” Jade Emperor said sullenly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course you will,” Ye Zichen smiled and continued to smoke. “Nobody can stop you right now. I cannot match you now that you have become a supreme. I’m just like a piece of meat on the chopping board, I can’t possibly doubt you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But you still came with me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why wouldn’t I?” Ye Zichen threw the cigarette on the ground and crushed it with his foot. Then, he patted away the ashes on his clothes and stretched lazily. “I’m not hiding anything, so I have nothing to be afraid of. Honestly? I have no interest in the Heavenly Court at all. The Immortal Region’s one of the Three Realms as well, and I’ve already reject Flame Emperor when he begged me to go back and be the big boss. Did you really think that I’ll try and steal the throne over here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You might say that, but I still cannot trust you,” Jade Emperor continued to lock his gaze on Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was hard to determine what people thought. He could not be certain that Ye Zichen had no interest in the Heavenly Court, or if it was just the Immortal Region’s plans.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now that we’ve come to this, I might as well be honest with you,” Ye Zichen took a deep breath. “I’m sure you knew about my identity from the very beginning. What I’m talking about is before I even came into contact with the Heavenly Court. Am I right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jade Emperor did not answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know even if you don’t say anything. I, as the Yellow Emperor, have always been a pain in the ass for you. Since the immortal Region people could find this reincarnation of mine, then I’m sure so can you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s not talk about my previous lives for now. During this life, I lived in the place known as the Abandoned Land to the Heavenly Court, also known as the Modern Realm. The reason I came here because something went wrong with the Modern Realm, I was forced here. And my only purpose is to return there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have to ascend to the God Realm after you broke through. I’m telling you know that I have to break through and ascend as well. I have already reached the top of the Three Realms, but I have not yet found a way to go back, so I can only try to find answers in the God Realm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If I don’t find anything in the God Realm, then I’ll keep searching upwards. I </span><i><span style>must</span></i><span style> return to the Modern Realm. That’s where my home is. Do you understand?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t care if you believe me or not, but I’ve said all I have to say. Honestly, I can’t possibly let you kill me. Lin Ru will come and save me the moment you attack. If you are still worried about me, then I’m sorry, I can’t do anything about that. I have to live on. I have to live on and return to the Modern Realm and there are a bunch of people who wants to return there with me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jade Emperor quietly listened to what Ye Zichen ahd to say.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, he tried to find hints and clues from Ye Zichen’s words and expressions about what Ye Zichen really felt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But sadly, he was moved by Ye Zichen’s words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He believed in Ye Zichen’s feelings.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Perhaps he put so much emotion into his words that it affected me, who is about to leave…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Perhaps I will be like him when I get to the God Realm…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>And try everything in my power to return here.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>No matter what, this is my home.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen bit his lips and squinted his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wasn’t certain whether he could convince the Jade Emperor to believe him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen played an important part in Jade Emperor’s breakthrough and if the latter had any sense of conscience, then he would not do anything to Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it was understandable from Heavenly Court’s supreme ruler’s view to want to get rid of Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The deities in the Heavenly Court were way too close with him!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, Ye Zichen was definitely going to protect his life. If the Jade Emperor still ends up attacking him, then he would understand it, albeit in disappointment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jade Emperor raised his hand up high.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen tensed up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, the hand landed… on his shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will trust you this one time.” Distrust clearly filled Jade Emperor’s eyes when he said that. He pursed his lips and looked at Ye Zichen. “You helped me break through. I am not someone who forgets what others have done for me. But I am warning you, if the Heavenly Court ends up in the hands of the Immortal Region after I ascend… Don’t forget that those in the God Realm can descend. If the Immortal region truly takes over the Heavenly Court, then I will dye the Immortal Region in blood and I will never let you get away even if you go to the God Realm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry,” Ye Zichen let out a sigh of relief. </span><i><span style>My gamble paid off.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He naturally could not trust the Jade Emperor completely, because it would not be the first time the latter go back on his words.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Who knows if he’s trying to give me a big one when I lose my vigilance.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>If he gets killed with one hit, then Lin Ru would have no way to save him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jade Emperor shook his head with a wry smile when he sensed Ye Zichen’s vigilance, “I guess I really put a bad impression on you. It was my bad, but I’m leaving, so I want to leave a good final impression on you. I said I won’t do anything, so I won’t. So, don’t disappoint me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m ten thousand times of a better person than you are. I don’t want your shitty Heavenly Court even if you gave it to me for free,” Ye Zichen said after getting to a safe distance from the Jade Emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, I’ll trust you this one time. Now, since we came to a conclusion, there’s no need for us to stay here anymore. There’s plenty of people waiting for us in the garden, I’m worried that my subordinates will come and try to save you because we haven’t gotten back yet. Brother Yellow Emperor, I really admire you for your skills.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, the Jade Emperor walked back towards the garden.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long after he left, Ye Zichen’s phone vibrated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He took out his phone and saw a message from the Jade Emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m leaving now, so I’ll give you all of this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>And what followed the message was…</span></p>
 <p><span style>A red packet!</span></p>
