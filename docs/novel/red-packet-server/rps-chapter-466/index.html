 <p><span style>Chapter 466 – Small Trouble</span></p>
 <p><span style>The shopkeeper stood at the entrance and waved towards Ye Zichen and co. with a smile in front of a luxurious pawn shop. He was definitely in a great mood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he was to sell their hundred something pieces of black crystals, then he would definitely earn a lot of profit, while Ye Zichen and co. were also very happy to have saved themselves the trouble of finding people to buy the crystals.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I welcome you to come cooperate with me again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha, Lord Fatty isn’t going to come to your place next time, you black-hearted merchant,” Fatty Yin twitched his mouth. He felt like the price was a bit too low, but since Lil’ Yu, Xue Qi and Stone felt like an average price was alright, he couldn’t really argue. Since they wanted to hurriedly get rid of the trouble-causing issue, so he didn’t negotiate that much.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fatty, your words aren’t right. I’m a trustworthy merchant,” the pawn shop owner chuckled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes and waved to him, before leaving with the rest of his group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank god we met you here. Otherwise, we really wouldn’t know what to do,” Ye Zichen smiled. Black crystals were priced at fifty thousand celeste per unit, and a hundred something pieces sold for a bit more than eight million. It was not going to be too difficult for the group to buy a manor in the city.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xue Qi and co. beamed with excitement, with so much celeste to buy a manor in the city…</span></p>
 <p><span style>They could already imagine how well the village was going to develop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lord Fatty didn’t think that I would bump into you here,” Fatty Yin rolled his eyes. “Lord Fatty was rather surprised, why would you be sent to this sort of crappy place with your strength? Back in the Modern Realm, you already had the strength to enter the Three Realms, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahem…” Ye Zichen quickly coughed. He looked at Xue Qi and co., then only after seeing that they didn’t hear anything, he glared at Fatty Yin and indicated for him not to talk about stuff recklessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk, you’re still pretending to be mysterious,” Fatty Yin twitched his mouth then shrugged. “You guys can go and buy the manor yourselves. I, Lord Fatty, will not go with you guys. Don’t be too worried about hiding the money though, I’ve been in the city for so many years, and have never seen anyone who would dare attempt a robbery.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re not coming with us?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows. Since he finally met a person he knew in the Three Realms, he did not want Fatty Yin to leave so quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The heck use is going with you guys? You paying me or what? Go and busy yourselves. I, Lord Fatty, will know if you guys get into any trouble. That’s that, see ya,” with that, Fatty Yin walked away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing him depart, Xue Qi and co. asked, “Why did he leave?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who knows what the fatty’s thinking. Ignore him, let’s just go and buy the manor,” Ye Zichen twitched his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Stone wrapped his arm around Ye Zichen’s shoulder, “Lil’ bro, laozi is truly getting curious about you. You have a spatial artifact, and can meet an acquaintance with a sales channel in the city. You can’t be the child of a large family, right!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Stone spoke, Xue Qi and Lil’ Yu also looked at Ye Zichen with a confused look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This ascender was truly too mysterious, and there was also that master who randomly helped them the other day. Xue Qi was very sure that the master definitely did not help them for him, or the village…</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen was there. </span><i><span style>Could that master be wanting to protect him?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Can you guys not look at me like that? Let’s hurry up and go and buy the manor, the villagers are still waiting,” Ye Zichen answered, while wearing a guilty face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ Yu looked at him meaningfully for a moment, then nodded, “Let’s go and buy the manor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ta ta ta…</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the sound of hurried hooves suddenly sounded out in the middle of the street. They turned around and saw a man wearing seven or eight men in official looking clothing speeding along the center of the streets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are they? I thought you can’t ride horses in this city?” Xue Qi raised his eyebrows in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Lil’ Yu twitched her mouth, “Isn’t it obvious? They’re definitely great people that normal people cannot afford to offend. Let’s not worry about so much and go and buy our manor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have a point,” Xue Qi nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as they were about to leave, Ye Zichen noticed a woman holding a young boy standing in the middle of the road. Judging from the speed that the horses were racing at, they would be unable to get out of the way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoosh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately dashed over, and shielded the two, then reached out a hand and slapped towards the horse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Neighhhh…” the horse raised its front legs in fright, while the handsome young man also fell off the horse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young master!” The people behind him all surrounded the young man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Ye Zichen turned around and patted the boy in the woman’s arm with a smile, “Hurry up and leave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you, thank you,” the woman repeatedly nodded in thanks, then hurried away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Xue Qi and co. who were going to buy the manor, also noticed Ye Zichen’s disappearance…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where did Ye Zichen run off to this time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Look, is that him?” Stone raised his finger, and pointed at Ye ZIchen, who was facing off against the horse-riding people in the middle of the rode.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This guy truly knows how to cause trouble,” Lil’ Yu bit her lips. </span><i><span style>These people are obviously people that we shouldn’t easily offend… </span></i><span style>“C’mon, let’s go over and take a look.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The handsome youth on the horseback, who had a terrible fall, walked in front of Ye Zichen with the support of other people and asked, “The woman and child just now…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Left!” Ye Zichen replied plainly. “If they think that the two of them scared your horse, then no need to blame them. I scared your horse.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just how are you speaking to my… my older brother!” the young man beside the handsome youth spoke up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes and ignored him. “This is a road for people to walk in the city, not a road for you guys to ride horses on. If you like riding horses, then go outside and ride them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m so sorry. We were in a bit of a hurry… so…” the handsome youth answered apologetically.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing his tone, Ye Zichen decided that the youth shouldn’t be an arrogant young master who enjoyed messing with peasants, so his cold face relaxed a little, “Even if you are in a hurry, you still have to watch out. Never mind, I’m in a hurry as well, so I won’t bullshit too much with you guys.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes, then saw Xue Qi and co. standing anxiously on the side and giving him a cue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, do you know who we are? You dare to speak to us like that?” the handsome youth’s little brother raise his hand to block Ye Zichen’s way, but Ye Zichen squinted his eyes and knocked his arm aside as he walked towards Xue Qi and co.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, what terrifying strength,” the youth’s little brother swung his arm, as a bit of interest sparked in his eyes as he looked towards Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The handsome youth also squinted his eyes, and looked at Ye Zichen with interest, “Hey, what are you called?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After hearing Lil’ Yu and co.’s complaints about how he made them worry, Ye Zichen turned his head when he heard the youth’s question…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, he directly left without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Original Chapter Teaser:</strong>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p><b>Lil' Yu:&nbsp;</b>Ye Zichen, just who exactly are you? How is it possible for you to even have connections to people that can sell black crystals in a random city?</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:</strong> Ahem...</p>
 <p><strong>Stone:&nbsp;</strong>Haha, don't mind that.</p>
 <p><strong>Fatty Yin:&nbsp;</strong>Ye Zichen and I go way back. We knew each other before he ascended, but let's leave those story for another time, since I'll be off.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>So quick? You aren't coming with us?</p>
 <p><strong>Fatty Yin:&nbsp;</strong>Why should I go with you? Are you paying me or what?</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>...</p>
 <p><strong>Fatty Yin:&nbsp;</strong>Do be careful here. This is a city in the Three Realms, and not like Bingcheng at all. You can't afford to mess with the people here. The customs here are definitely going to be different from down there as well.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Yes, yes. I know. Avoid arrogant young masters. Keep a low profile etc. Is there anything else?</p>
