 <p><span style>Chapter 9 – Peach of Immortality from the Immortality Peach Garden</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen found out from Commissioner Liu’s explanation that there actually was someone else that wanted to invite him there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Ye Zichen walked along the shiny corridor until he reached the end, he continuously looked around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This sort of business club was obviously not just a single level higher than the Latte he went to previously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Commissioner Liu, Director Xiao has been waiting inside for quite a while.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the entrance to a room at the end of the corridor, the manager of the club smiled and pushed the door open for Commissioner Liu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was immediately shocked just after entering the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person was not just anyone else, it was Xiao Hai, with whom they had just separated paths with not that long ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Liu-ge.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Commissioner Liu entered the room, Xiao Hai went over. When he saw Ye Zichen and Su Yiyun, he clearly was dazed for a moment, then he asked Commissioner Liu in confusion, “Liu-ge, the Lil’ Ye you were talking about couldn’t be Zichen, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You know him already?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Commissioner Liu was also stunned for a moment, then shook his head with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yep, the Lil’ Ye I was talking about was him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hai-ge,” Ye Zichen and Su Yiyun called out to him at the same time. Xiao Hai shook his head with a light smile, the moment he had met Ye Zichen earlier, he already felt that Ye Zichen was different from other people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After calling everyone to sit on the sofa, Xiao Hai spoke directly without cutting any corners.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, Hai-ge is not going to beat around the bush with you. This time that I asked Commissioner Liu to get you to come, I want to ask whether you still have that Great Recovery Pill. I can buy it from you with a high price!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Great Recovery Pill!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was momentarily speechless. It seemed like Xiao Hai had found out about the effects of the Great Recovery Pill from Commissioner Liu and wanted to buy one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, it didn’t seem like he had any diseases. </span><i><span style>Could it be just for emergency? Or was it for someone else?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, he had only managed to get just that one Great Recovery Pill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Recently, Old Lord Taishang had not gave out any red packets, where was he supposed to get one from...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hai-ge, I don’t have anymore Great Recovery Pills.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen answered honestly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you afraid of us not paying you for it or what?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, an unfriendly voice sounded out in the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked over in the direction of the voice, and saw a young man about his age was standing in the corner of the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was covered from head to toe in luxury goods. It was clear that he was a typical rich second-generation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huang Ming, apologize to Zichen,” Xiao Hai said with a frown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cousin, this fellow clearly just wants to raise the price. Why are you being so courteous with him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Ming was Xiao Hai’s biaodi. Due to having a big brother like Xiao Hai, he couldn’t see anyone straight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The thing my older cousin brother lacks least is money. Brat, just name how much you want for that thing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Ming ignored Xiao Hai’s warning and walked over in front of Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To be honest, Ye Zichen was very displeased about his high and mighty attitude.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Due to giving face to Commissioner Liu and his relationship with Xiao Hai, he didn’t explode, and merely answered him patiently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I really don’t have any left.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ten million, how about that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Ming’s shamelessness especially and his look of “laozi is rich” disgusted Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Being rich is amazing?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Being rich allows you to look down on people?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“No Great Recovery Pill!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The atmosphere in the room immediately turned frigid. Everyone could feel Ye Zichen’s displeasure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Ming still wanted to act out, but Xiao Hai stopped him before he could make things worse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shut up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Hai roared, causing Huang Ming to immediately shrink his neck and walk off to the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, Hai-ge really needs this Great Recovery Pill…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing the earnestness in Xiao Hai’s eyes, Ye Zichen touched the phone in his pocket due to his unwillingness to see that kind of expression, and stood up from the sofa.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait a moment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen quickly ran off to the club’s bathroom and promptly sent a message to the Monkey King.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great Sage Sun, are you there?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you call me, Old Sun, for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Monkey King pretty much replied instantaneously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you still have any of those Great Recovery Pills from Old Lord Taishang? Send me a few.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How could Old Sun have the shitty pills from that geezer!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Monkey King replied instantaneously once again with three contempt emojis.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, Ye Zichen felt rather troubled. However, the Monkey King sent another message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you need the Great Recovery Pill for? It isn’t anything special, that geezer gets several hundred of them when he refines a single furnace of it. He gives them to the heavenly soldiers as candy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>……</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was speechless, the people in the Heavenly Court were truly luxurious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This little deity ran into some trouble and needs a Great Recovery Pill. If Great Sage doesn’t have any, then this little deity will go and figure something else out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t do anything if the Monkey King didn’t have any Great Recovery Pills</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wasn’t at all familiar with the other deities in the group, so he couldn’t exactly add Old Lord Taishang as a friend just to ask for private red packets.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>God knows what their intimacy level was. What if he was found out?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He could only say that Xiao Hai was very unlucky. All of a sudden, Ye Zichen felt that he couldn’t bear to face him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t sell the painting to him, and now there was nothing he could do when Xiao Hai wanted to buy a Great Recovery Pill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I, Old Sun, don’t have the geezer’s Great Recovery Pills, but the peaches from Old Sun’s Mount Huaguo aren’t any worse than his pills.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just when Ye Zichen was about to give up, the Monkey King had sent another message over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then hurry and send it to me, Great Sage!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, you want Old Sun’s peach? Shouldn’t you do something first?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Great Sage Sun sent three finger hooking emojis. It seemed like he still wanted more Wahaha Calcium Milk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen could only make him a promise for the future since he didn’t have anything on hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This little deity is outside right now. How about this, Great Sage send the peach over to this little deity now, and this little deity will send something to you later.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You couldn’t be tricking, I, Old Sun, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How would little deity dare.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I knew you wouldn’t.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When a red packet appeared on his screen, Ye Zichen clicked on it without thinking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You have collected the Monkey King’s red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Peach x1</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen quickly clicked open his Treasure Chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He clicked “withdraw” on the peach in the Treasure Chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A peach that wasn’t any different from a normal one appeared in Ye Zichen’s hand. He looked at the pinkish peach sitting in his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gulp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a peach from the Water Curtain Cave. Ye Zichen wanted to be able to eat it as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Never mind, never mind, I will have a chance to eat one in the future.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen suppressed his desire to eat it and walked back to the room with the peach.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Ye Zichen had left the room, Xiao Hai was rather worried. This Great Recovery Pill was extremely important to him, the old man back home was relying on his getting this Great Recovery Pill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big bro, that brat just wants to get more money out of you, we’ll raise the price a bit later, then it’ll be fine. What’s more, do you really believe that Great Recovery Pill would even work?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Huang Ming finished, Commissioner Liu’s expression turned dour.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s this supposed to mean, was Huang Ming implying that he was lying?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Liu-ge, don’t mind him too much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Hai looked towards Huang Ming with a frown, his biaodi was truly only good at messing stuff up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just who was Commissioner Liu? Wasn’t Huang Ming putting it that way clearly making Commissioner Liu look bad!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, Little Bro Xiao, Liu-ge isn’t that sort of petty person. The reason I brought Lil’ Ye over is purely because you begged me to and our relationship was pretty good. You also seem to know Lil’ Ye, so you should be clear about just what sort of person he is.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Hai’s expression turned serious for a moment, as he thought back to incident at the antique street…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This Ye Zichen is truly a master!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Although the Great Recovery Pill was a bit too shocking, he was willing to try to get one for his family’s old man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the door to the room was pushed open. Xiao Hai’s eyes also brightened at hearing the door, while Huang Ming’s mouth showed nothing but contempt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he was going to leave, then just leave, yet he came back.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>After doing so much, didn’t he just want to con them for more money!</span></i></p>
