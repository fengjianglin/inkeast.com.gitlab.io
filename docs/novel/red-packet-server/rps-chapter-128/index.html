 <p><span style>Chapter 128 – Nine Yang Life Continuation</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nobody saw how this box of silver needles appeared. Ye Zichen directly opened the box and took out a silver needle to start to perform acupuncture.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Which hospital are you from? Do you have certifications?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The male medic from suddenly grabbed Ye Zichen’s shoulder from behind. The tremble on his shoulder nearly caused the needle to pierce at the wrong location.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s heart tensed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The acupuncture he was about to perform did not allow for any mistakes…</span></p>
 <p><span style>If one needle was in the wrong place, then the consequences were unimaginable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck off!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s heart nearly exploded when he nearly ended Yang Yushi’s life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He turned around and pointed towards that male medic and yelled with blood red eyes, “Don’t touch me again, otherwise, I’ll make you die a terrible death!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The male medic tensed for a moment, then he finally came back to his senses and reached out towards Ye Zichen’s shoulder again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen put some force into his right arm and directly dislocated it. Meanwhile, he also pierced the silver needle in his hand towards the center of the male medic’s eyebrow without hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s right hand was suddenly grabbed by someone. When he looked up, he saw that the person who reached out his hand was Zu Siliang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You want to stop me as well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zu Siliang shook his head with a solemn expression, “You’re a Chinese doctor?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you think!” Ye Zichen revealed the silver needles in his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How confident are you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thirty percent, but if I don’t, then there’s no hope.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thirty percent!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although this probability was very low, Zu Siliang understood Yang Yushi’s situation as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She wouldn’t make it in time to the hospital.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay, perform the acupuncture. How can I help!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe!” Ye Zichen suddenly laughed coldly and looked at the frantic crowds and media, alongside the assassin that was put under control. “Do what you should do.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, he ignored Zu Siliang. He believe that the brat understood what he could do with his brain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen concentrated and removed all extra thoughts from his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Acupuncture!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nine Yang Life Continuation!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen called out and pierced the final needle in!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The bleeding at Yang Yushi’s chest had already stopped, while a hint of color gradually returned onto Yang Yushi’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Ye Zichen seemed like he was completely weakened, but his face showed a happy smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Success!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Nine Yang Life Continuation Needle was the strangest acupuncture therapy. There were forty-nine needle pieces used in total, but it needed to all be set within ten odd seconds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During this process, the needles had to be precise, and could not be away from any of the acupoints or on a wrong acupoint. It was something that needed an extremely high level of concentration.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, the silver needles also contributed to the success.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen bought it from the Treasure Shop for 2000 cultivation experience. It was a single-use item that could increase the chances of success for the acupuncture therapy by ten percent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen saw that Yang Yushi’s conditions stabilized, he raised his hand and wiped away the sweat on his forehead, before shouting unenergetically, “Zu Siliang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it? What else do you need me to do!” Zu Siliang thought that Ye Zichen needed some help, because the duration was really too short, it wasn’t even five minutes in total.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But when he saw Ye Zichen, who seemed like he was just fished out of water, his pupils contracted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Send Yang Yushi to the hospital,” Ye Zichen panted heavily, then struggled to stand up. “Do no let anyone touch those needles. Absolutely nobody. Also, this concert… Never mind, I don’t want to say too much, you should be clearer about it compared to me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will give you an explanation for this,” Zu Siliang’s expression was terrifyingly dark. He was the one who organized the concert, and something like this actually happened…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t need your explanation, you just need to give Yang Yushi and her father an explanation. Remember, do not let anyone touch the silver needle on her!” Ye Zichen waved his hand towards Zu Siliang, then left under Su Yan and co.’s support.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, are you alright?” During the way back, Su Yan and Xia Keke sat on either side of Ye Zichen as they asked how was he.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen could lean on a beauty’s shoulder just by slanting his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wouldn’t others be super jealous of him if they found out?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothing, I’m just a bit weak right now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What sort of acupuncture therapy did you use just now? Why are you like this after you finished?” Su Yan asked worriedly and continuously wiped the sweat on his forehead and cheek.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How should I reply this,” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows. “It just took up a bit too much concentration, so it got me too tired, so I feel weak.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan nodded slightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke also complained on the side, “Why was it like this? Yang Yushi is so great, why did someone act like that to her on the concert. Thank god there was Riche Bro. Otherwise, there would be one less star that I like!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s expression darkened when he heard that, and snorted coldly, “Blame it on Yang Yushi’s father for being too arrogant.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm? What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen knew that he said the wrong thing, so he quickly corrected what he said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, his heart was cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it wasn’t for Yang Yushi’s arrogant father, how could she have fallen into this state?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was always acting so high and mighty, never looking at anyone properly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>How could this sort of person lack enemies!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He did protect himself well, but Yang Yushi…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s phone rang. He took out his phone and looked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>White Impermanence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He quickly put his phone away. Su Yan and Xia Keke were so close, he would definitely be found out if he chatted there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen jumped onto his bed and took out his phone when he returned to his dorm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>White Impermanence: I’m going out to work again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seems like White Impermanence had a really good relationship, she would tell him even when she went to work.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You've been troubled. Where are you going this time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bingcheng First People’s Hospital!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>White Impermanence replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reapers of the Underworld like them did frequent places like hospital quite a lot. Just as he was about to reply, an unknown number suddenly called his phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hello?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is it Ye Zichen?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The voice on the phone sounded very solemn, but this did not affect Ye Zichen’s ability to identity who it was.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zu Siliang? What are you calling me for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It really is you. Hurry to the First People’s Hospital. Yang Yushi, she…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened to Yang Yushi?” Ye Zichen suddenly bolted up from the bed, while everyone else in the room also stopped chatting and glanced over seriously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Someone pull out your silver needle…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck!” Ye Zichen swore angrily. “Didn’t I tell you not to let anyone touch that needle? You couldn’t protect Yang Yushi during the concert, and now you can’t even guard the silver needle when you’re in the hospital. What exactly can you do!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I… Sorry…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry… Sorry my ass. I’ll be right there, wait for me properly!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was about to go crazy due to Zu Siliang, he already f*cking told him not to let anyone touch the needle!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He actually let someone pull it out!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, he remembered that White Impermanence told her that she was going to the First People’s Hospital!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“White Impermanence, who’s soul are you going to take!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you asking this for!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is very important to me, just tell me quickly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If there were no surprises, the soul she was going to take is…</span></p>
