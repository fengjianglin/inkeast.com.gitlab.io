 <p><span style>Chapter 359 – Chain Reaction</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye ZIchen suddenly raised his eyebrows as he looked at the smile on Qu Qitong’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you looking me like that for? Alright, I admit that I told Yumei that. Boss Ye, you can’t cancel my dealership,” Qu Qitong said in a slightly spoiled manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, Yang Jian gulped. </span><i><span style>The girls here are so cute. If it wasn’t because I still have work in the Heavenly Court, I might really just stay in this lower realm.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not that petty,” Ye Zichen smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A moving smile surfaced on Qu Qitong’s delicate face instantly, “That’s great. Hehe… The press conference has ended. Then… Big boss who set up a little target, can you treat us to a meal!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Does a big boss like you require me to treat you?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No matter how big of a boss I am, it isn’t comparable to your small target of a hundred million!” Qu Qitong looked at him meaningfully.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This phrase was just for me act cockily, I didn’t expect this woman to use it to mock me. </span></i><span style>Thus, in order to shut her mouth, Ye Zichen rolled his eyes in annoyance, “Fine, fine, fine, you choose the place!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then let’s go, Boss Ye!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>What Ye Zichen did not know was that his small target had already been widespread through the net. The number of replies in threads about him in various major forums already surpassed a hundred thousand, while he even gained several new titles…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dominating CEO!</span></p>
 <p><span style>National Hubby!</span></p>
 <p><span style>National Love Rival!</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, people even found his Weibo, causing his number of fans to soar up into the millions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, that was only the beginning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within a large courtyard house, a report about Maintaining Beauty Corporation’s press conference fell into the middle-aged man’s ear when he turned to the economic channel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was extremely curious about that corporation…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Until he saw that man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He knitted his eyebrows tightly together. When Xiao Yumei said that Ye Zichen was the true owner of Maintaining Beauty Corporation…</span></p>
 <p><span style>His face stiffened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He had used a million to make me leave his daughter…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slam.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The middle-aged man turned off the television while incomparable rage surfaced on his face. He used his hands break the remote controller in his hands, as well as the tea table, and the television…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He broke everything that he saw.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The bodyguard rushed in from the outside, then blanked out for a moment when he saw the state of the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man looked up and roared at the bodyguard, “F*-F*ck off!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The bodyguard left in terror, while the man picked up a box of cigarette from the ground and took one out to hold in his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen… Did you deliberately say it for me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, in the female dormitory of a certain university.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A slightly pretty girl held the Maintaining Beauty skin care products she bought after working for a month and lining up for several hours.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as she sat down on the bed, her roommates waved towards her, “Yao Yue, come, come. Look, is this person your boyfriend?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The girl walked over in confusion, and saw an eye-catching title…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maintaining Corporation’s Hidden Boss Has Spoken: A small target – A hundred million!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The accompanying photo below was the photo of Ye Zichen answering naturally in the press conference. She subconsciously snatched the mouse over, and read the text below, then turned to the skin-care products that she treasured…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yao Yue, he’s your boyfriend, right! No wonder you weren’t staying in the dorm recently. Ai, Dominating CEO! Set a small target, and earn a hundred million first. Wow… If you become a famous person’s wife, then don’t forget about us!” the girl’s roommates smiled flatteringly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yao Yue released her mouse dumbly, and sat onto her bed…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yao Yue, my dad also works in cosmetics and skin-care products. Can you get your boyfriend to meet him?” one of the girls asked. That girl’s family background was rather wealthy. Previously, she had acted high and mighty with everyone in the dorm, and her manner of speaking was something that had never been seen before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s rather busy recently. Wait till he has time!” Yao Yue smiled wryly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The girl nodded, “True, it’s normal for big bosses like him to be busy. Please help me out when he’s less busy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, the girl took out an unused limited edition LV bag from the cabinet beside her bed. Yao Yue had already set her eyes on the bag several months ago, but she hesitated to buy it due to it being too expensive…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Here, for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yao Yue received the bag over in a flattered manner, while the girl spoke up again, “Promise, okay? You definitely have to mention my dad with your boyfriend.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“O-Okay!” Yao Yue had wanted to come clean, but when the bag and her vanity was placed in front of her, she chose to let the misunderstanding continue on!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Ye Zichen did not know such chain reactions would occur just because of a single sentence he said. At that instant, he was within a hotel in the capital and answering toasts in a slightly troubled manner.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wow, this woman, Qu Qitong, is really capable at drinking.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>If it wasn’t for Ye Zichen secretly using celestial spiritual energy to remove all the alcohol from his body, the woman might have already got him drunk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Ye, you can seriously drink!” Qu Qitong raised her thumb, then lifted another glass of liquor with a high alcoholic concentration over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s the toast for this time?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows helplessly. Qu Qitong managed to find something to toast for every single time, and she had pretty much mentioned everything already.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A toast to your drinking capabilities!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled wryly and bumped his glass against hers, then gulped down the liquor, only to find out that the woman had raised her wine glass once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you continue like this, then I will suspect you of trying to get me drunk so that you can act out your ulterior motives!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Ye is really funny. I have no way of taking advantage of you with Director Xiao here!” Qu Qitong replied with a faint smile, while silently thinking to herself…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>You really guessed it right. I do want to get you drunk!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But why is he so capable at drinking?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t mind me. If Director Qu wants to, then just take him home tonight,” Xiao Yumei smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Yang Jian, who sat on the same table, silently retorted.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why not take me home tonight!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Really?” Qu Qitong’s eyes lit up. “Director Xiao is willing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why wouldn’t I be willing? Worst come to worst, I’ll just get another sister,” Xiao Yumei replied generously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen felt rather troubled after hearing that. </span><i><span style>Just what are you guys talking about. If you guys keep talking like that, then I actually might get given away…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>However, from the looks of Qu Qitong, it seems like she really does want to…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Ye Zichen’s phone on the table rang. During this period of time, his calls and messages have pretty much been endless, since most of them teased him for his dominating aura…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen glanced at the caller ID.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Gu Tian!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why’s this guy calling me. According to my understanding of him, he isn’t that interested in these matters.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen picked up the call with knitted eyebrows, then heard Gu Tian shout, “Big Brother Ye, come to the Gu household. I can’t manage it anymore!”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Original Chapter Teaser:</b>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Hmmm... Let's turn on the television to see what's going on today? Hmm? Maintaining Beauty Corporation? That's the new cosmetics company that's the new trend, right? I believe it's also the same company that Yushi is endorsing?</p>
 <p>That was definitely a good move. She'll only become more famous this way, and it looks like this company will keep being the star of the market for a long time with their great products.</p>
 <p>I wonder if it will be a good idea for me to go and form a partnership with them. It will definitely be very profitable, and with Yushi endorsing them, I can't imagine them not wanting to partner up with me...</p>
 <p>Hmm? WHAT. THE. HELL. Why is he speaking? He... is the actual owner of Maintaining Beauty Corporation!?</p>
