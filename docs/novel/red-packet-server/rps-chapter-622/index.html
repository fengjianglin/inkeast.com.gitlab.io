 <p><span style>Chapter 622 – Three Pairs of Wings</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t you even think about reconstructing your body!” Luo Wei glared at Ye Zichen’s body angrily. Cracks appeared on the ground as he leaped high up into the air and punched the green barrier with both hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, the power behind the punches seemed to be absorbed the moment it came into contact with the barrier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, within mere moments…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The barrier reflected the absorbed energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luo Wei immediately knew that it wasn’t going to be good, so quickly retreated…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he was still affected by the residual force, causing him to cough up a mouthful of blood due to him having already used a lot of his energy before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He knelt down on the ground, looking rather frail and panted heavily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Father!” Luo Yang hurried over, but Luo Wei pushed him against the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Look at what you have done! He has already reconstructed his body. The best chance to kill him is gone now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Father, Brother Ye isn’t someone from the Demon Realm,” Luo Yang couldn’t help but try again to reason on Ye Zichen’s behalf.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t? You’re still saying that he isn’t right now...?” Luo Wei pointed at the unconscious Ye Zichen who levitated above the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When everybody raised their heads to take another look…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s body had already been reconstructed. After his dead skin had peeled off, the new skin beneath seemed to shine like jewels. Yet, what truly made everybody speechless was the three pairs of black and white striped wings behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve read about it in ancient texts that only Fallen can grow wings. The more wings a Fallen has, the more talented he is. Even since ancient times, the Demon Emperor recorded in the text only had three pairs of wings. He… He is comparable to the Demon Emperor!” Luo Wei said with bloodshot eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The others were also stunned when they heard his words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fallen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Demon Emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye ZIchen is definitely not someone of the Demon Race,” Li Jiayi said in an extremely certain tone. She looked up at the wings behind Ye Zichen. “I’m sure of it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure of it!?” Luo Wei squinted his eyes as he snorted. “How can you be sure? Even if your master is here, she wouldn’t so as much dare to say that he’s not a demon!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What can you even do about it?” Li Jiayi smiled. “It’s already like this. Do you think you still have a chance to kill him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luo Wei turned silent at her words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked up at the barrier. Even as someone amongst the strongest in the Three Realms, he still couldn’t do anything against the barrier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if the barrier disappeared, he couldn’t be sure that he could match Ye Zichen, who had three pairs of wings that signaled his talent as equal to the past Demon Emperor that had terrorized the entire six realms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, he wasn’t even in peak condition.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The barrier shattered. A ray of light shone down from the sky and onto Ye Zichen, causing him to seem rather holy. At the same time, there was still a hint of black mist amidst the holiness, causing him to seem rather dark.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He opened his eyes and looked lifelessly in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This is a chance! </span></i><span style>Luo Wei gritted his teeth. This was his final chance to kill Ye Zichen. Luo Wei understood that it would only become increasingly more difficult if he allowed Ye Zichen to regain his consciousness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He formed a claw with his right hand and reached towards Ye Zichen’s throat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He already mustered up all of his spiritual energy in an attempt to kill Ye Zichen with one strike.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Clap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, right as his hand was about to wrap itself around Ye Zichen’s throat, Ye Zichen lifted his hand and grabbed his arm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“City Lord Luo, what is this for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“To kill you,” Luo Wei attacked with his left hand in a more troublesome position as he maintained a dark expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pulled back and asked with great confusion, “City Lord Luo, when did I offend you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Demon spies must die!” With that, Luo Wei suddenly stopped attacking and landed back onto the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Ye Zichen also stopped in the air. Neither of them made any other moves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on?” Stone scratched his head in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Jiayi glanced upwards. “They’re fighting using their primordial spirits.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Approximately five minutes later. Luo Wei clenched his chest and coughed up a mouthful of blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen also retracted his wings with a wry smile, “City Lord Luo, why did you choose to harm your primordial spirit like that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen handed a pill over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Luo Wei slapped the pill away from Ye Zichen’s hand and looked up with a dark gaze and laughed. “I didn’t expect that this Silence would have allowed you to gain such strength. I, Luo Wei, is no coward. Do as you please!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Luo Wei let down his guard and glared forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won’t kill you,” Ye Zichen shook his head with a smile. “I’m not surprised that City Lord Luo thinks that I’m someone of the Demon Race. These wings are indeed the symbols of demons. But I am not a demon!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ridiculous. Fallen are known as the royalty of the demon race, Chief Ye actually said that…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s all I have to say regardless of whether you believe me or not,” Ye Zichen shrugged. “As for killing you, that’s something I definitely won’t do. City Lord Luo, please take your leave!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you sure? As the city lord of Maple City, I do have a tremendous reputation. I already know about your identity as a Fallen. When I return, I’ll definitely contact my friends to deal with you,” Luo Wei squinted his eyes with a snort. “So stop pretending. Right now, my primordial spirit is harmed, and I definitely cannot match you, who has demonic blood flowing through your veins, in physical combat. Although killing me here will expose your identity, at the very least, you can say that you did something.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please” Ye Zichen made a please gesture.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luo Wei, who seemed like he was about to self explode, smiled, “It seems like your plans are greater than I imagined. Don’t regret letting me go today!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Luo Wei turned around and left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, Ye Zichen shook his head and landed onto the ground helplessly, then picked up the jade vial with a pill within and handed it over to Luo Yang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Here’s a Recovery Pill. Although it isn’t really useful for one’s primordial spirit’s recovery, it does have a bit of an effect on it. Give it to your father.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright,” Luo Yang put the pill away. Then couldn’t help but call out. “Brother Ye.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not a demon,” Ye Zichen turned around with a soft smile and met Luo Yang’s sincere gaze. “Actually, I didn’t want these wings. They are essentially the most glaring stain on my life. But I can’t help it, I couldn’t refuse them. But I can promise you right now that I’m definitely not a demon. Quite the contrary, I have an unresolvable vendetta against the demons! Perhaps this is all baseless talk, but time will show you the truth and prove everything.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I believe you,” Luo Yang said with a smile. “Oh yeah, Little Sister Zuo Mo really misses you. If you have time, then go back and take a look. She seems really annoyed recently since she’s about to get engaged with the Mu Family sickly bastard and has been talking about you to me all the time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zuo Mo,” Ye Zichen paused for a moment. </span><i><span style>I seem to recall her mentioning that engagement thing to me. </span></i><span style>“I understand, I’ll find some time to see her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, since I’ve already passed along the message, then I’ll be off,” Luo Yang left the courtyard with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Ye Zichen turned around and to see Li Jiayi’s beautiful face, “You came!”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Original Chapter Teaser:</strong>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Ye Zichen felt himself in a surreal state. After he ate the chocolate the system had gave him through a red packet, he felt a burning sensation. It was not a pleasant one. In fact, he felt as if everything burned,&nbsp;from his skin to his muscles to even his own organs. At that moment, he felt as if he was going to die.</p>
 <p>Yet, when the burning seemed to have come to an end, he found himself... somewhere else. He could not seem to open his eyes, yet it was as if he could hear the words of the people around him. Or... it might have been a dream. For some reason, he saw many of his friends appear around him. He also saw the city lord come to where he is. Then... he saw the city lord try to kill him.</p>
 <p><em>Why is he trying to kill me?</em></p>
 <p>Before Ye Zichen could figure that out, an unexpected figure arrived... Li Jiayi. That old classmate from his from high school. She seemed to have arrived to... stop the city lord from killing him?</p>
 <p>Then... one by one,&nbsp;his friends seemed to step up and in front of the city lord despite their huge difference in strength.</p>
 <p>Ye Zichen was moved.&nbsp;<em>There are so many people who care about me...</em></p>
