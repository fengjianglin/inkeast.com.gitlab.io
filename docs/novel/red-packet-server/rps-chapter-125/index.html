 <p><span style>The next evening.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Yushi’s concert was going to begin in three hours.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every single one of the people in Ye Zichen’s dorm was a crazy fan of this public goddess.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen thought back to when he brought out the concert tickets…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Getting kissed by five men was truly embarrassing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you guys done yet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stood at the door and called Su Yan. As he looked at everyone, who were doing their hair and clothes, he couldn’t help but sigh, “It seems like it’ll be a bit longer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then alright, we’ll wait for you guys underneath your dorm. Tell them to hurry up. Keke and I don’t mind, but it isn’t so good to tell the others to wait.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, I’ll try my best to hurry them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen hung up and walked straight to Zhu Yunbai, who cared most about his appearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And kicked him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop dressing yourselves, the people from Su Yan’s dorm are waiting for us outside, so hurry up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The people from the goddess dorm are waiting for us?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not only Zhu Yunbai, even the eyes of Zhang Rui, Bai Yu and Kang Peng sparkled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi, look, how do I look…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but sigh with his hand on his forehead, it seems like what he said had made it worse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In order to show their most handsome appearances in front of the girls, Kang Peng and co. used another ten-odd minutes before finally walking down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment they went downstairs, Ye Zichen saw Su Yan, Xia Keke and Sun Yige chatting happily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gulp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was unknown who gulped, bit it was like a chain reaction, causing everyone else to gulp as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Three school beauties…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhang Rui licked his lips and his eyes shone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other people were like that as well, while Ye Zichen got a bit confused.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Sun Yige is in the same dorm as them?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Riche Bro.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke immediately ran over to hug Ye Zichen’s arm. At that moment, he felt the jealous gaze of everyone around him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan also greeted him with a smile. Ye Zichen smiled, then shook his head and sighed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Class Rep, I didn’t think that you were roommates with Sun Yan and them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm,” Sun Yige maintained her introverted personality and didn’t reply as she dipped her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked around, it seemed like the three of them were the only ones there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen thought back to Sun Yan’s words and rubbed his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did Sun Yige get the concert tickets?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No,” Su Yan replied. “It was our dormitory’s big sis. She went to buy water, she’ll be back in a moment. Let’s just wait a bit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She’s a huge beauty,” Xia Keke also laughed lightly on the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I heard that the four school beauties in school lived together, is that true?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhang Rui, the gossip-lover, popped up from the side and asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke nodded to confirm it, “Yeah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Ye Zichen was shocked when he heard this reply, but even more than that, he was filled with anticipation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had seen three school beauties, he did want to see the fourth…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Someone that could be named alongside Su Yan, Xia Keke and Sun Yige as the school beauty couldn’t be bad, right!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Thief, stand still!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Ye Zichen, who was waiting for the big sis of Su Yan’s dorm, suddenly ran out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, a girl, who was holding cold drinks, immediately ran when she saw him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lucy, stop!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did I bump into him here...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lucy ran as she turned her head to see the distance between them. Despite them being very far away from each other at the start, a girl like her was unable to out run a man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, she stopped, then walked back as she pretended like she didn’t know anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop,” Ye Zichen grabbed her arm and said with a playful expression. “Not running anymore?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are you? I don’t know you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lucy said specifically in English, as if she wanted to get over this by pretending to be a foreigner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled at her, “Go on, keep pretending!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lucy continued to act like she was very worked up as she spoke in English, while trying to get away from Ye Zichen’s arm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Su Yan and co. also hurried over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lucy’s eyes brightened when she saw this, “Help me, someone is trying to molest me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh? You want to cause a commotion, right? Hehe, so sorry, I called these people over.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen turned around and said to Su Yan and co.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry up and call the police, I caught a thief.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone was shocked!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You didn’t make a mistake, right?” Su Yan finally asked in a testing manner after a long while. “She’s the big sis of our dorm, Liu Qianqian. What thief!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah? Big sis? Liu Qianqian?” Ye Zichen was a bit confused.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wasn’t this girl Lucy!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Liu Qianqian also ran to Su Yan’s side and said in a troubled manner, “Su Yan, hurry up and call the police. This bastard tried to molest me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qianqian-jie, he’s the Ye Zichen I spoke to you about.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shocked!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both of them were shocked!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qianqian and Ye Zichen stared at each other for an entire minute.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m a bit confused. Let’s get this straight,” Ye ZIchen closed his eyes and put his right index finger between his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a long while, he opened his eyes and pointed at Liu Qianqian, “She’s the big sis of your dorm, and one of the school beauties of our Polytechnic University, Liu Qianqian, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She gave you guys the tickets, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The girls nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Clap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clapped loudly, shocking everyone, “Then that’s right. Lucy, why are you still playing dumb with me. Hurry up and speak the truth.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Riche Bro, why are you always calling Qianqian-jie Lucy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This girl got drinks off me at the bar and told me she was called Lucy. Also, do you know where she got the concert tickets? She stole them from me. At the time, I…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk, you’re shameless,” Liu Qianqian put her hands on her waist, then snorted with her chin raised. “I’ve never seen you before, don’t slander me. I’m a person with a reputation in Polytechnic University. What do you mean got drinks off you at the bar? What do you mean stole your concert tickets? Do you have proof? If you don’t, then I’ll sue you for slandering.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wow!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It really was something to get as thick-skinned as her.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Her ability to push the blame was definitely top notch.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Su Yan also pulled on the corner of Ye Zichen’s shirt to stop him from saying too much.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled coyly, “Sorry, I got the wrong person.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Liu Qianqian instantly raised her chin high, “Be careful when you speak from now on. Not everyone has as good a temper as me! Heh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She snorted like a tsundere, turned around, then left while holding Sun Yige’s and Xia Keke’s hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Ye Zichen nearly coughed up blood.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wow!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>So speechless!</span></i></p>
