 <p><span style>Chapter 21 – Pure Dragonball Fanboy</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were in the suburbs of the city.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen didn’t think that the driver had already drove this far. It’s all because he was just playing with his phone in the car and didn’t look at the road.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Clap, clap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the yellow-haired driver clapped, six or seven young men, who had dyed their hair with all sorts of colors, walked out from the bushes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, bro, you earn quite a bit of money doing what you do, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye ZIchen smiled with a cowardly look. Although he was a bit confident with his ability, it was hard for one person to fight against multiple people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he really fought these people, he might not be able to win.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, this was the f*cking suburbs, he still needed these people to send him back to school.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t f*cking waste laozi’s breath. Choose it, which leg?” The yellow-hair pulled out a baseball bat from somewhere and put it on his shoulders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big bros, don’t get so irritable! Why must we get violent in such a peaceful society. Am I right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he dragged the time on, Ye Zichen put his right hand in his pocket and opened WeChat using his familiarity with his phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But he couldn’t click open that Treasure Chest even after opening WeChat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brat, what are you doing in your pocket?” Yellow-hair pointed Ye Zichen’s arm a few times with his baseball bat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pa.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The phone fell onto the floor, while the yellow-hair roared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck, you want to call the police!? Beat him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ones with green and red hair immediately surrounded Ye Zichen. They say when a person was in danger, they would often be able to use the infinite potential of their bodies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was no exception to that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With a flip, he grabbed the phone in his hands and opened the Treasure Chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Withdraw Body Enhancing Pill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A delicate jade bottle appeared in his hands, but Ye Zichen didn’t have time to appreciate it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He poured out the golden pill form the bottle and directly chucked it in his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A wave of power surged through Ye Zichen’s body, while his eyes also released a faint golden light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Super Saiyan!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was unknown which one of them shouted that, but Ye Zichen couldn’t help but snort coldly for fun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I actually let you discovered the secret of me being a Namekian. It looks like I can’t let you live.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Transform! Super Saiyan!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The yellow-hair’s baseball bat directly snapped with Ye Zichen’s punch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen did not hesitate at all, and with only a few punches and kicks, he was able to all beat those delinquents to the floor within a minute.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Putong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Bro, I didn’t know that you were a Super Saiyan. I promise I definitely will not leak the news of you being a Namekian. Please let me off.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The yellow hair prostrated on the ground, while his face was covered his mucus and tears. Ye Zichen had truly shocked him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although his subordinates hadn’t received any kind of systematic training, they were all masters at fighting and definitely hit hard.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>But damn, just how long did it take…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>All of his subordinates were lying there, while screaming in pain!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ha.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nearly laughed out loud because of this yellow hair. This child’s intelligence is truly worrisome. It seems like he watched too much Dragonball.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He really treated me as a Super Saiyan.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But, messing with him seemed rather fun.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you sure you will not reveal it? Don’t think about lying, I have my ways to know about your thoughts!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His eyes flashed with a gold light, causing the yellow-hair to shudder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>……</span></p>
 <p><span style>He peed himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I really won’t say it, I definitely won’t say it, I swear…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though he peed himself, yellow-hair still acted like he didn’t know and solemnly swore while raising three fingers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye ZIchen twitched his mouth in contempt, then pointed towards the clothes of the red-hair, who was beside him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm, you truly didn’t lie. Go and change, then take me back to Polytechnic University.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As they took the taxi back to the road, yellow-hair had already changed his clothes, but the smell was still a bit…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled down the car windows. Even though he couldn’t take it, he still had to.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>There were no other cars here!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, are all you Namekians Super Saiyans?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He’s still mentioning it...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Although Ye Zichen couldn’t bear to do this anymore, he still had to continue the act.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes,” Ye Zichen said with a cold expression. Yellow-hair peaked at Ye Zichen and said, “Big Bro, can you accept me as your underling? I never missed any episode of any of the Dragonball franchise, I have always had a dream of becoming a Super Saiyan in my heart!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He truly was a Dragonball madman, he completely went dumb from watching!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is alright, but let me ask you something first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please say it, big bro!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yellow-hair nodded furiously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Was it a person called Fu Chengming that called you to come find me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen thought about it after getting in the car, it seemed like the only one with a grudge and the motive was him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, big bro, how did you know?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yellow-hair was completely shocked. Ye Zichen twitched his mouth, then grabbed yellow-hair’s shoulders and said solemnly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you really want to follow me, then the organization will give you a mission right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big bro, say it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fu Chengming is actually an android sent by the evil forces, he has always wanted to destroy the friendship between Namek and Earth. Your mission is to watch him, and report the situation to me any time there’s a change!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yellow hair’s expression turned serious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t think that the organization would give him such an important mission.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Androids!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He hated them the most!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“For the tribe!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, you’re in the wrong show!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After yellow-hair sent Ye Zichen back to the school, he drove the taxi away. Before leaving, he promised Ye Zichen that he would watch the android closely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen didn’t know whether he should laugh or cry for meeting someone as foolish as that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he couldn’t help but take to note that Old Lord Taishang’s Body Enhancing Pill was really amazing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After that pill entered his body, Ye Zichen felt like all of his bodily functions were being developed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For example, his current reaction speed was at least twice as fast as a normal person’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After returning to the dorm, it was no surprise that his roommates were all fighting on Summoner’s Rift.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck, Ol’ Five returned. Hurry up and help me play a bit, my stomach is really hurting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Ye Zichen entered the room, Big Bro Kang Peng held his own stomach and ran out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sat down in front of Kang Peng’s computer while everyone else greeted him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Solo top Riven.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had always played support in the dorm. The main reason was because he was too terrible, the people at the dorm wouldn’t let him play any of the other positions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though he was just playing for Kang Peng, Zhu Yunbai couldn’t help but lower his confidence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fifth Bro, if you really can’t, then just hug the turret and farm. Just don’t feed the enemy Fiora.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, Ol’ Five, please don’t feed the enemy Fiora. The enemy’s Fiora has an extremely high win rate, it might even be an Elo Booster.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t feed!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everybody in the room pretty much said the same thing. As Ye Zichen thought back to his own match data, he couldn’t retort, and could merely twitch his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before the minions were there, Ye Zichen stayed under the turret and thought about reading some Riven guides, but the enemy Fiora directly stood in front of him and started taunting him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>F*ck, he definitely couldn’t accept that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately leaped over after leveling Broken Wings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fiora brought Ignite. She did not back down against Ye Zichen’s Riven and fought directly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a trade in abilities, the Fiora nearly lost her entire HP bar. The enemy also realized that it was looking bad, so she turned around and ran.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ran!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen flashed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>First Blood!</span></p>
