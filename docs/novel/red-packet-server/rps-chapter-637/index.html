 <p><span style>Chapter 637 – Yin Xiong’s Provocation</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…” Ye Zichen turned silent. </span><i><span style>Is there something wrong with that woman!?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Someone wants to meet </span></i><b><i>me</i></b><i><span style>? Through her?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Tell whoever wants to see me to come on over. I can’t be bothered to move,” Ye Zichen laid down on the chair and looked lazily at Zuo Qingcheng with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Leisure House’s chief is truly cocky,” a snicker sounded out amongst the crowd.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Zuo Qingcheng and co. all made way in the middle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Ye Zichen also looked up and saw that “Senior Brother Yin” from the Hundred Flowers Gate walk over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Yin,” the surrounding people all cupped their hands at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This man wore a rather eye-catching set of clothes to the engagement ceremony.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, this set of silk clothes seemed rather out of place on him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior Brother Yin nodded his head coldly, clearly not thinking much of the people around him. All of the young people were furious, but didn’t dare to say a word. After all, Yin Xiong was practically the second chief disciple in his sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He might even have a chance to compete to be the Gate Master of the Hundred Flowers Gate, even though… He was a man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yin Xiong walked through the crowd and in front of Ye Zichen, then looked down at the latter with an arrogant smile, “I’m here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…” Ye Zichen’s expression stiffened for a moment, then he raised his eyebrows. “Have we met before?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yin Xiong’s expression drastically changed. He felt like he was losing face in front of all the people present.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zuo Qingcheng, who’s this? He was the one looking for me? I don’t know him…” Ye Zichen shrugged helplessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Qingcheng walked between the two with a smile and begun to introduce the newcomer, “This is the Hundred Flower Gate’s…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brat, stop pretending here. I’m the Hundred Flower Gate’s Li Jiayi’s senior brother, Yin Xiong, we met at the teleportation portal to the Hundred Flower Gate previously,” Yin Xiong interrupted Zuo Qingcheng and squinted his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Qingcheng maintained her smile and backed off to the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen also scratched his head, then finally exclaimed after thinking about it for a long time, “Oh, it’s you. Sorry, I don’t really remember small fries.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ouuuuu…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The surrounding youngsters all couldn’t help but take a deep breath. </span><i><span style>Just who </span></i><b><i>is </i></b><i><span style>this young man? He actually dared to call Yin Xiong a small fry.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Yin Xiong clenched his fist, then pursed his lips, “Leisure House’s chief is sure cocky.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s not a problem as long as my breath is fresh. But you… you ate garlic didn’t you? You have a serious breath issue,” Ye Zichen crossed his legs while wearing a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yin Xiong pursed his lips with a smile, “What’s the point of just blabbering. I came to find you for a simple reason. I was worried that you would be a retard and seek out my junior sister again, so I’ve come to help you remember. I do want to see just how strong Leisure House’s chief is.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The atmosphere immediately changed. A terrifying pressure radiated out from Yin Xiong.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Mid stage Sky Immortal.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>No too bad.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sighed speechlessly, then stood up with a shrug, “You want to fight?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yin Xiong nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows and looked towards Zuo Qingcheng, “This is your engagement ceremony. Would you like us to fight?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Both of you are amazing people. How would I dare to affect your decisions,” Zuo Qingcheng smiled.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I’ll have to be honest, this girl really knows what to say and is very capable of hiding her feelings.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>She isn’t offending anyone, but that’s natural. After all, neither side winning will cause her to lose anything.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahh, this is a tough thing,” Ye Zichen shrugged helplessly. “Say, I’m the actual chief and have to fight you, a youngster? It doesn’t look good if I win, it’s even more embarrassing if I lose…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You really think you’re the chief now, huh,” Yin Xiong snorted, “That puny Leisure House isn’t even comparable to a hall from our Hundred Flower Gate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, is that so,” Ye Zichen shrugged with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you are pussying out, then admit your wrongs. I will generously forgive you,” Yin Xiong squinted his eyes in obvious mockery.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen glanced over at Zuo Mo, “This guy’s kind of famous in the outer regions of the Immortal Region, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He is rather famous amongst the younger generations,” Zuo Mo nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright then, since my Leisure House isn’t that famous yet, then I’ll just let this grandson be a stepping stone. But you guys have to bear witness to this. This grandson was the one who came up to me and spouted shit. If I injure him, or completely turn him into a disabled… Seniors from the Hundred Flower Gate, please don’t cause trouble for me,” Ye Zichen looked around with a smile. Then, he turned towards Yin Xiong. “Find somewhere for us to fight. It really isn’t quite right for us to fight at their engagement ceremony, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yin Xiong originally intended to just fight right there. He had absolute confidence in his own strength. He wanted to quickly dispatch Ye Zichen and make the latter lose face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After all, everyone who came to the ceremony were reputed people in the outer sector of the Immortal Region. If he could step on Ye Zichen, then the latter would never be able to lift his head up anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen was right. If he was to force the fight there, it really would be ungentlemanly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We have a martial practice field. How about going over there?” Zuo Qingcheng asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, lead the way,” Yin Xiong nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Qingcheng nodded and led them away, while Yin Xiong followed behind her without looking back, as if looking back was an insult for himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was just going to keep forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zuo Mo, help me advertise this. Tell everyone to watch the show. I’ll use this chance to bring some more fame to Leisure House.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem, but Yin Xiong is rather strong. Aren’t you worried that…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What should I be worried about?” Ye Zichen smiled with a shrug. “He might be superbly strong in the eyes of others, but he’s just a kid in my perspective.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the Zuo household’s martial practice field.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The news of their fight spread like wildfire with Zuo Mo’s advertisement. Thus, a lot of people hurried over to watch the show.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yin Xiong looked around and snorted, “It seems like you won’t be able to stay around in the outer sector of the Immortal Region anymore. Prepare to get your Leisure House torn apart.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re that confident?” Ye Zichen chuckled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“One hit is more than enough to deal with you!” Yin Xiong lifted his finger arrogantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shrugged, “I used to have a friend as arrogant as you, but now, his tombstone is already covered in grass. C’mon, I do want to see just how strong your one hit is. Oh yeah, do I win if I block it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure,” Yin Xiong merely smiled proudly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, many people all praised him for how much he seemed like a hero of the old, while some people even began to say that Ye Zichen was too cowardly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen merely smiled indifferently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter what, that was all just bullshit. True strength was the only thing that mattered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come,” Ye Zichen hooked his finger towards Yin Xiong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yin Xiong squinted his eyes, “Your spiritual energy…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do I need it against you?” Ye Zichen gradually replaced the smile on his face with a cold expression. “Come. Show me your one hit.”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Original Chapter Teaser:</strong>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:</strong> A friend of yours... Wants to meet me?</p>
 <p><strong>Zuo Qingcheng:&nbsp;</strong>Yes.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Zuo Qingcheng, what are you playing at? I don't exactly recall us being buddy-buddy with each other.</p>
 <p><strong>Zuo Qingcheng:&nbsp;</strong>I'm telling the truth, there really is someone that would like to meet you.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Oh.</p>
 <p><strong>Zuo Qingcheng:&nbsp;</strong>Shall I lead the way then?</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Huh? I think you're misunderstanding here. If your friend wants to meet me, then tell him to come over. I can't be bothered to move. What's more, I don't even know what the guy is.</p>
 <p><strong>Stepping Stone No. 46543213:</strong> Well well well. Chief Ye is sure arrogant.</p>
