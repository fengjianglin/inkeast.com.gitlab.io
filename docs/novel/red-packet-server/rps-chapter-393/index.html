 <p><span style>Chapter 393 – Sky Immortal Liu Qing</span></p>
 <p><span style>The cold words sounded rather cute to everyone’s ears, while the two blades of energy also made contact with the ground, causing a huge crackling sound.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite that being the only thing that happened, the power of that attack still chilled people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oops, I missed,” a cute voice rang out in the sky once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leopard Tail and the others quickly retreated to their original position and frowned, “Who!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehehe, why should I tell you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A saintess-like figure with white boots slowly descended from the sky with a giggle, while flower petals danced occasionally around her, making her seem all the more beautiful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Liu Qing!” Ye Zichen exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The girl ran to his side with a giggle, “Did you miss me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she got closer, Ye Zichen was even able to feel the tremendous of spiritual energy surrounding her body. It was as if it flowed out of her body…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>No, it’s not flowing out of her body.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s because her affinity with the spiritual energy in the world itself was too great, so spiritual energy would gather towards her wherever she was.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen merely wanted to revive her, but… He had actually revived her into a genius.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, why are you looking at me like that!” Liu Qing twitched her mouth and rolled her eyes at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“N-No!” Ye Zichen stuttered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leopard Tail, who stood at a place not far from them, snorted with a frown, “Who are you? Did you not hear what this marshal said!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So annoying…” Liu Qing suddenly pouted unhappily. She looked around and stared at Leopard Tail…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leopard Tail, who was standing on the ground, suddenly flew backwards and fell to the ground, creating a huge crater.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m talking to Ye Zichen. Don’t interrupt. If anyone dares to speak, then I’ll hit you,” Liu Qing raised her small fists threateningly, with her cute voice saying such threatening words, caused everyone to not dare to even utter a single sound.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>She was able to use the spiritual energy of the heavens and earth so that a single glare from her could cause a late-stage Human Immortal expert was heavily injured without being able to react!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>This is strength that only someone of a cultivation level above Sky Immortal could have. This cute girl who looked to be seventeen or eighteen years old was actually a…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Sky Immortal!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>After Leopard Tail got out of the crater with the help of his brothers, the way he looked towards Liu Qing had completely changed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It became full of wariness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Intense wariness flashed across his eyes. That hit earlier was more than enough to make him understand the huge difference between the two of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, why aren’t you speaking… Did you get shocked senseless? I’m amazing, aren’t I!?” Liu Qing smiled proudly like a young girl. All of the surrounding Yin Marshals were stunned. </span><i><span style>A Sky Immortal level expert was actually so close with the brat.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“A-Amazing!” Ye Zichen could no longer hide the shock in his heart. </span><i><span style>This wasn’t just amazing, alright…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>She’s strong enough to completely destroy a Human Immortal level expert, so even the monkey would find trouble with her!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>If this girl went to the Heavenly Court, then wouldn’t she be equal to Old Lord Taishang and co.? More importantly, Liu Qing was definitely someone who wouldn’t leave my side.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Doesn’t that mean I am going to have a super strong helper by my side from now on?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>This is a bug, right?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>The system will definitely punish me for getting a late-game legendary item during mid-game.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, it’s good that you feel like it’s amazing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing shook her head with a sweet smile, then hooked her fingers towards Bao Tan, causing him, who was originally trembling in the corner, to fly over uncontrollably.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandpa, save me!” Bao Tan kicked and struggled as he screamed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leopard Tail wanted to speak up, but he could only choose to remain silent when he noticed Liu Qing’s gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm, that’s more like it!” Liu Qing snorted towards Leopard Tail, then smashed Bao Tan down heavily in front of Ye Zichen. “Did this fatty make you unhappy? I’ll leave you to deal with him. Just bully him however you want. If anyone dares to object, hmph…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing was truly an overlord at that moment. It was no exaggeration to say that even if all the Ghost Marshals attacked her together, they would not be able to defeat her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bao Tan laid on the ground while trembling. Currently, he was truly terrified to no end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My lord, why did you come over here?” King Chujiang hurried over helplessly.. He had wanted to talk with Liu Qing in the Reincarnation pool, and she had agreed to it, but that lord had disappeared within the time needed to drink a mouthful of water.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang looked at the injuries on Leopard Tail, and Bao Tan, who was lying on the ground…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This lord definitely made a move.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Why not? Someone bullied Ye Zichen, so I have to protect him!” Liu Qing rolled her eyes and snorted. None of you here are good people, all of you like to use plots and ploys. The hearts of all plotters are dirty. I don’t like you guys.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh my lord!” King Chujiang was about to go crazy, and since he had no other choice, he could only beg Ye Zichen. “Master, say some good words to this lord. She was revived in our Underworld, so be merciful. You are a great person, so don’t take offense about this. Just leave this at that!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but silently sigh when he saw King Chujiang’s pitiful look and was reminded about all those times that he had troubled King Chujiang previously. He looked towards Liu Qing, then spoke up, “Never mind…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Chujiang was extremely happy, causing him to silently comment on how this master was easy to talk to.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Liu Qing twitched her mouth in displeasure, then snapped her fingers…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bao Tan let out a terrible scream, while a bloody mist surrounded him as if his body had exploded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This will make you remember. If you make Ye Zichen unhappy from now on… Then I’ll make your entire family unhappy!” Liu Qing twitched her mouth and left while holding Ye Zichen’s hand. King Chujiang looked towards Leopard Tail and co. to indicate them to clean Bao Tan up a bit, before he left behind Ye Zichen and Liu Qing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, the rest of the people also left in shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, right before leaving, Leopard Tail hammered the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That woman…” Leopard Tail squinted his eyes and snorted. “We’ll endure it. Since we have managed to become connected with those people, it is just a matter of time before we breakthrough to the Sky Immortal level. Laozi will make them pay for this sooner or later.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Ye Zichen and Liu Qing returned, the little beggar followed carefully behind them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing pouted and looked behind her, “Who is that little fella?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little beggar instantly shrunk his neck back when he was named. He had seen how amazing the big sis was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My new subordinate. We’ll all on the same boat now,” Ye Zichen replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing indicated that she understood before asking, “Then are we going back to the Modern Realm now? I’ve already been revived, can we not stay here anymore? I don’t like this place…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ll definitely go back, but we have to wait a bit,” Ye Zichen smiled wryly. </span><i><span style>I haven’t stolen Diting’s leg yet. If I return, then aren’t I just seeking death?</span></i></p>
