 <p><span style>Chapter 63 – Taibai Jinxing sought him out</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, she wants to add your WeChat!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was only able to react when Liu Qing, who was above him, shouted. He smiled coyly and said, “Ahh, sorry, I was lost in thought just now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled softly after adding White Impermanence as his friend on WeChat, “You have to act stronger when you’re with Black Impermanence in the future. If he dares to bully you anymore, then just WeChat me. Just watch how I deal with him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm,” With that, White Impermanence disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long after she left, Ye Zichen’s phone buzzed. It was a message from White Impermanence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>White Impermanence: Thank you.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, say, you really are good are chatting up girls. Humans are one thing, but you’re not letting ghosts get away either.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing revealed a face of disdain towards him. Hearing that, Ye Zichen couldn’t help but chuckle, “Do you think there’s something wrong with me? Chat her up? If I really wanted to chat up a ghost, I should chat you up shouldn’t I? You’re cute and are always by my side.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk, only a ghost requires your chatting up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Liu Qing went back into the Dragon Eye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shook his head with a smile, then took out the Dragon Eye from his pocket and laughed playfully, “Aren’t you a ghost!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>...</span></p>
 <p><span style>The next morning, Ye Zichen looked at his phone after washing up, and saw that it was full of messages of thanks from Su Yiyun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was also a message of receiving payment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was two million.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen didn’t need to think too much about it. Only Su Yiyun’s father would be able to hand that much out in one go.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, Ye Zichen did have a bit of selfish intent when he chose to save Elder Su. This caused him to feel kind of guilty when he saw that someone had giving him such a huge red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your trial of the Fiery Eyes of Truth (Level 1) has 72 hours of time remaining.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the hell?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at the reminder on WeChat.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Fiery Eyes of Truth trial time.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Stop messing around, the sole reason why he had been able to do so much was due to the Fiery Eyes of Truth.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It didn’t say trial when it was first taken from the Great Sage at the time, why did it randomly turn into a trial. What’s more, there’s only three f*cking days left.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing @ you in the chat group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen instantly became confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What did Taibai Jinxing @ him for in the group?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen opened the WeChat group, and could only be shocked when he saw that the group had already exploded.</span></p>
 <p><span style> Erlang Shen, Monkey King, Yue Lao etc. all appeared in response to his being @.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Sky Canopy General, God of Thunder, Mother of Lightning and Immortality Peach Fairy all started to watch the show.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Geezer, what did you @ my bro for?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: Geezer, what did you @ my good friend for?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: @Monkey King, my bro is a good friend of yours?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: @Erlang Shen, you said that my good friend is your bro!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The flaming had begun!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although those two people had started flaming, Ye Zichen’s heart turned cold after seeing Taibai Jinxing @ him.</span></p>
 <p><span style> Taibai Jinxing: @Only Idealism, add me as a friend.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen didn’t react after seeing that. He didn’t do anything.</span><i><span style> Why the hell did this geezer want to add him as a friend?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He was been a standard lurker after he entered the group. The only time that he wasn’t was when he turned on Erlang Shen impulsively, but in the end, they managed to settle their differences and swore to be brothers.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Taibai Jinxing @ Ye Zichen once again.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck</span></i><span style>.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Could he have been found out?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Fortune was not going to be trouble</span></i><span style>. He’ll add him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I have accepted your friend request. Let’s chat!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first thing Ye Zichen did was look at the intimacy level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>100.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Friendly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Aiyo, friendly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen instantly smiled. At the same time, Taibai Jinxing also sent him a message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing: Do you know what I found you for?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: This little deity doesn’t know.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing: Are you sure you’re a little deity? &lt;insert several snicker emojis&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The hand Ye Zichen was holding the phone with quickly trembled, while Ye Zichen nearly chucked the phone away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing knew that he wasn’t someone from the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: I don’t understand Great Deity Taibai’s meaning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing: Stop pretending, I know your identity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s heart instantly felt cold, this geezer actually knew his identity. Then what was Taibai Jinxing finding him for? Was the geezer going to directly kick him out of the group?</span></p>
 <p><span style>If that’s really the case, then there was no need to add him as friend.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just directly kick him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, their intimacy level was Friendly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing: Don’t be nervous, I won’t do anything to you. Could you have forgotten how you came to this group? I invited you in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was stunned upon seeing that, then tried to carefully remember the situation when he just entered the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He really did seem to be invited into this group by Taibai Jinxing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: What do you want?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing: Hehe. &lt;insert three snicker emojis&gt; You added the WeChat of a ghost servant of the Underworld, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Yeah.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing: I’m going to give you a mission. If you accept, then I won’t kick you out of the group and will give you a celestial title so that you can be like fish in water within the group. How’s that?</span></p>
 <p><span style>To be honest, Ye Zichen had been suspicious of how he entered this group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had randomly been added into a deities’ group, and started to snatch red packets from deities. This was definitely something akin to a free lunch from heaven.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Such a huge lunch could crush a person.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He had thought that there was a trap at the start.</span><i><span style> Alright, there really was a f*cking trap.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Great Deity Taibai, I’m just a mere mortal, what can I do?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing: Hehe, you don’t seem to understand your own situation too well. But no worries, you’ll slowly understand.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What did that mean?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What? Was he the reincarnation of a deity?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Isn’t that bullshit?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Taibai Jinxing sent another message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing: Are you accepting it or not. Decide promptly, I’m very busy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen licked his lips. Even if he knew that what there was a huge trap following this free lunch, he wasn’t willing to easily give it up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: What is it?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing: Enter the inner circle of the Underworld. Tell me what actions the Underworld has at all times.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Spy.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen instantly understood, this geezer wanted him to be a spy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He carefully considered it, he really didn’t seem to notice anyone from the Underworld within the Heavenly Court’s group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Could the Underworld and the Heavenly Court had their relationship soured?</span></p>
 <p><span style>No wonder, then it seems like Taibai Jinxing had planned all this when he asked whether Ye Zichen had added a ghost servant as friend.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Then what benefits are in it for me?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing: As a mere mortal, isn’t the ability to snatch red packets and earn treasures from both the Heavenly Court and Underworld a benefit already?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This crafty old fox.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, Taibai Jinxing sent another message very quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing: Of course, I can’t possibly make you do it for free. How is it, are you accepting it?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen thought about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing wanted him to enter the inner circle of the Underworld to be a spy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During so, he could publicly chat, brag, add friends and increase intimacy level in the Heavenly Court’s group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This seems to be a deal in which he wouldn’t lose anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, he wasn’t able to think of any kind of dangers. However, if he really notices any danger, then wasn’t it fine for him to directly quit?</span></p>
 <p><span style>When that happens, he would have earned so much already.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Who cares about some stupid deities!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clenched his teeth and replied Taibai Jinxing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I accept.”</span></p>
