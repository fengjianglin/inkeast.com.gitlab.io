 <p><span style>Chapter 444 – Who Won?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Beep beep.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A car horn sounded out from behind Ye Zichen and Xia Keke not long after they left from the hospital.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They turned around, and saw Lin Ru wave toward them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?” Ye Zichen said as they got into their car.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They haven’t met for a while, so her sudden appearance was definitely no coincidence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t give me that shitty look. Do you think I want to come and find you? You have a girl with you every single day, seriously… Are you trying to make everyone feel bad?” Lin Ru rolled her eyes at him. “My grandpa’s looking for you, but don’t ask me why. I don’t know. I’m just a driver.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Old Man Lin?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen squinted his eyes, while he wondered in confusion. </span><i><span style>What’s that old man looking for me for? I already healed all of his wounds.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>There isn’t anything that we have in common, and he’s finding me several months after I treated him…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Strange!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, he could also tell that trying to see if Lin Ru knows something looks impossible. She acted as if she was on her period, and put on a cold expression like someone owed her a lot of money.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, none of the three people in the car spoke as they drive straight into the Lin household.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was already winder, and Bingcheng’s temperature was lower than the south, so it was already terrifyingly cold. The servants and security guards in the courtyard all wore thick padded jackets. However, Old Man Lin only wore a shirt, while he sat in the courtyard and played go with Lin Hanben.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandpa, they’re here,” Lin Ru shouted out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Man Lin, who sat next to the go table smiled, then nodded, “Okay, go in. That dumb kid has been waiting for you in the living room for a long time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm,” only then did a brilliant smile bloom on Lin Ru’s face. She ran into the living room with a giggle, while Ye Zichen walked over to Old Man Lin’s side with Xia Keke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hanben, stop wasting time with this old man. Leave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay,” Lin Hanben stood up, then nodded towards Ye Zichen with a smile, then left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sit,” Old Man Lin pointed at the place Lin Hanben sat in before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Ye Zichen sat down, Old Man Lin said…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who do you think has a better chance of winning in this match?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen did not know what to say. </span><i><span style>I might be able to figure something out if it was Chinese Chess, but Go…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s too advanced for me.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“White!” Ye Zichen randomly picked a side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Man Lin nodded faintly, then raised his eyebrows, “Mm, I understand. Leave!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the hell?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is there something wrong with this geezer? He got Lin Ru to bring me over with so much trouble, and we were even stuck in traffic for two hours. We barely said anything to each other, and he merely asked me who will win… That’s it?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ignoring everything else, Ye Zichen immediately expressed that he was not someone that the geezer could call over and force to leave at will.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gramps, are you messing with me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No,” Old Man Lin smiled, then pressed the black piece in his hand onto a spot on the board.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You play there, you lost!” Xia Keke raised her eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Man Lin smiled, “This old man naturally knows that, but since Lil’ Ye said white will win, then I’ll let white win.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just what kind of weird stuff is he sprouting? Why don’t I quite understand?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>He’s letting whichever side I said would win gain victory? Then if I said the black side would win, then the blacks would win? But what does that have to do with anything?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Gramps, why did you actually want me to come over for?” Ye Zichen looked up him in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Man Lin merely messed up the Go board with a shake of his head, and a smile, then put the pieces away piece by piece.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I just told you to come and watch a Go match. Hanben and I have already played a lot of games before coming. I never expected you to see this one,” Old Man Lin shook his head with a wry smile. Not long later, he stood up from the chair and stretched lazily. “Alright, go back. I already know your decision.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you mean by my decision? This Go game… Gramps, make yourself clear,” the more Ye Zichen the more he confused. </span><i><span style>Just what is he saying? I don’t understand at all.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, alright, go back!” Lin Hanben walked towards the mansion with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen frowned and wanted to block him off, but two men in black masks suddenly appeared in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir, you can’t walk any further!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go and stay in the corner,” Ye Zichen raised his hands to push the two men away, but when he touched them, he noticed…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Experts.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why does the Lin family have these sort of experts? They’re at least of the complete-stage Human Immortal level.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Let me give you a suggestion. Donate all of your income from your medical company, that might be of help to your future path,” Old Man Lin suddenly stopped and smiled. “Oh yeah, after so long, I wonder if you are ready to listen to how I got hurt?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Say it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After being through so much, Ye Zichen no longer cared about the reason behind Old Man Lin’s injuries.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s just getting beaten up by a hidden family at most. I’m already fighting with the demons, so this level of problem doesn’t affect me at all.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But since this geezer wants to say it, then hearing it is alright as well.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Demons!” Old Man Lin smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Ye Zichen’s expression froze. When he finally returned to his senses and wanted to ask Old Man Lin about the specifics, he noticed that the geezer had already returned to the mansion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir, please leave,” the two masked men made please gestures.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stared straight at the geezer’s back, “Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen turned around and dragged Xia Keke away without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Old Man Lin stood silently at the entrance to the mansion, when Lin Ru walked over, “Grandpa, what did he choose?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“White’s victory!” Old Man Lin smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ru’s expression drastically changed, “Doesn’t that mean…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I feel like he chose very well. At least he still has the hope of turning the tables, but this kid will be very troubled,” Old Man Lin let out a sigh, then patted Lin Ru’s head. “Alright, stop caring about so much. Your talent has only awakened, so overthinking so much is of no good to you. Let everything happen naturally!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, what was that gramps saying just now? Why didn’t I understand everything? The chances of black winning were clearly larger,” Xia Keke pouted in the taxi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shook his head and knitted his eyebrows, “How would I know? I don’t get Go myself… That gramps said a bunch of random stuff. I don’t know why, but I have a bad feeling about it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, Ye Zichen still had a lot of questions, an example of that was what the old man said…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Demons!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Were his injuries due to the demon race?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Also, why did he bring me over to ask who the victor of the match is? Does that change everything? Why did those two Human Immortal experts appear in the Lin family? Isn’t the Lin family just a family of businessmen?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>There’s something wrong with all this!</span></i></p>
