 <p><span style>Chapter 284 – Getting into Danger</span></p>
 <p><span style>Birds of a feather flock together was definitely a saying of absolute truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Ye Zichen glanced at Cai Xinyu’s wiggling waist and the flirty gaze she sent him, he was unable to deny that she was definitely a beauty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, come back here. You got so focused on her, could it be that you really want to leave with her?” Xiao Yumei pouted in complaint.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen lifted his hand and pinched her cheek, “What are you thinking? I can barely satisfy you, if that sis joins in as well, I’m afraid that I would die before I get old.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe,” Xiao Yumei giggled. “Don’t just think about how slutty Xinyu appears. Actually, she’s more conservative than anyone. Also, don’t think that she’s simply a flirtatious flower, even if she is a flower, she’s the kind with thorns…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shrugged. He didn’t actually have much interest in her.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Whether she has thorns or not has nothing to do with me.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>After Ye Zichen left Xiao Yumei’s place and returned to his mansion, he sat on the sofa and re-organized the items in his Treasure Chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He found a greenish-blue secret scripture within. When he saw the secret scripture, he was completely shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had a limited number of secret scriptures. Unbreakable Body, Fiery Eyes of Truth, Taibai Jinxing’s Special Medical Journal, Literari Star’s Memory Techniques and God of Food’s Culinary Experience.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He chose to learn all of the secret scriptures after getting them, but he… did not remember this one at all!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clicked on the secret scripture.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Great Dao of Heaven’s Birth Technique: A divine-level technique created by the Yellow Emperor of the Five Emperors.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This technique can see fate and find the location of the deities, demons, ghosts, yaos and people in the Three Realms. As this technique goes against the laws of the world, it requires tremendous energy to use.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Required level: False Earth Immortal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Expenditure: Large amounts of cultivation experience.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen read the introduce of the secret scripture in shock. </span><i><span style>Doesn’t this mean that I can see whoever I want after learning it?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>That includes the deities in the Heavenly Court!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>This technique is way too amazing, but why is this secret scripture in my Treasure Chest?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, Ye Zichen decided to go through the past system notifications…</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he expected, there was a notification about the secret scripture. The time of the notification was after his video call with Taibai Jinxing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Lil’ White ran over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, there’s a situation!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked up in confusion and saw Lil’ White’s face frown in a human fashion with a hint of solemnity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s happened?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was Ye Zichen’s first time seeing Lil’ White like that. What’s more, since Lil’ White was a dog from the Heavenly Court, Ye Zichen’s expression also turned serious, “Did you feel something?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your mom!” Lil’ White’s eyebrows knitted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen kicked Lil’ White immediately and raised his eyebrows, “You got so brave that you dare to curse me now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, I’m saying that your mom is in trouble!” Lil’ White’s face was completely serious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your mom’s in trouble, my mom went on a tour with Jinglei-jie and Tiantian… You mean that my mom is in trouble?” Ye Zichen jumped up from the chair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ White nodded, “I left an imprint on your mom. The thing I feel from the imprint is danger.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Sorry……”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately dialed Mother Ye’s number.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry, the number you dialed is not in service at this time. Please try again later. Sorry…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately dialed Mu Jinglei’s number, but the answer was the same.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can you locate them? Ye Zichen frowned.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>There might be a very normal reason for the call not to get through, they might be having fun in a place with no signal. But Lil’ White wouldn’t just randomly…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes,” Lil White nodded with certainty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen drove out the car as quick as he could and threw Lil’ White in the front seat, “Tell me where!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Auntie Ye, don’t you feel like there’s something weird about our tour guide?” Mu Jinglei, who followed behind the tour guide asked quietly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were with a tour, but what was strange was that there was no group activity at all when their tour guide sought out the three of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The tour guide had said that he would take them to look at a rather famous cave nearby, but they had been in the car for nearly an hour, yet no cave was in sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandma, Tiantian wants water,” Tiantian looked up and opened her mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Rong handed a bottle over to her with a smile, then asked the tour guide, “Tour Guide Li, how long until we’re there?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Soon, we’ll be there in a moment,” The tour guide was a very sweet-looking girl. Her smile made it hard for people to be even a tiny bit vigilant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tour Guide Li, this is the third time you have said soon. We’ve been in the car for more than an hour, the speed you’re driving isn’t slow at all, we’re clearly already out of the scenic area!” Mu Jinglei said with a frown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t be anxious, we’ll be there very soon,” The tour guide smiled sweetly, then turned around and ignored them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Jinglei was clearly very dissatisfied with her answer, but Ye Rong grabbed Mu Jinglei’s hand and shook her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Some ten-odd minutes later, the car gradually came to a halt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both Mu Jinglei and Ye Rong, looked outside. It was very rural, and there weren’t any caves in the surroundings either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tour Guide Li, what did you drive us here for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, even Ye Rong looked a bit angry. They had gone out to take their minds off things, but after sitting in the car for more than an hour, they found out that their tour guide actually took them to a place like that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, Tour Guide Li had said that she would take them to see a mysterious cave, but it was clear that…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their tour guide had lied to them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t be angry, just follow me and you’ll see,” Tour Guide Li smiled kindly, while her sweet smile calmed people down…</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Mu Jinglei did not care one bit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tour Guide Li, please take us back to the scenic area now. If that’s the case, then we’ll treat it as if nothing happened. If you don’t, then we’ll take a cab back and file a complaint against you to your agency…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Jinglei immediately felt a slap on her face before she even finished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sweet-looking girl looked at her menacingly and cursed, “I didn’t like the look of you from the start. You had the most to say during the journey. I told you to come with me, so just follow… Why the heck do you have so many questions!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you doing? Ye Rong frowned, but she did not directly complain about the tour guide’s attitude.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It would clearly be laughable for her to mention the tour guide’s service attitude when she had already used violence. What’s more, she even drove them to a place like this…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?” The sweet-looking girl clapped. Not long later, two long-faced men with snake scales on their arms walked out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two men instantly had a lustful look in their eyes as they gazed towards Mu Jinglei and Mother Ye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Snakes were lecherous creatures, so they were naturally unable to control their lust when they saw Mu Jinglei and Mother Ye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, the sweet-looking girl smiled, “Capture them!”</span></p>
