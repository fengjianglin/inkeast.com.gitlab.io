 <p><span style>Chapter 747 – Six Months</span></p>
 <p><span style>Six months passed by.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the inhabitants of the Immortal Region got their rest, they started to put the demon invasion behind them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The merchants on the street started to call out to potential customers, while the civilians started to gossip once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, the appearance of the ley line also meant that cultivation was no longer that difficult.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Smiles finally returned to their faces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as peaceful as it was before the invasion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the six months, Ye Zichen’s wounds had also completely healed, but something did remain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He would always go to one specific place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The peak where Liu Qing left him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He would often watch the surroundings at the side of the cliff with a drink, and when he closed his eyes, he felt like he could still hear Liu Qing crying her heart out.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Was there more to it?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>That was a question that repeatedly surfaced in his mind. Liu Qing did return to the God Realm, but for some reason, he had a feeling that the situation was completely different.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why was she so tearful? Why was there endless reluctance to part in her eyes?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He did not understand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All he could do now was wait for the right moment and find out after he ascends.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Several people rushed through the sky. Ye Zichen put his liquor aside and saw that it was Xue Qi and Stone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two of them had also reached the Sky Immortal level with the aid of the ley line.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now, the Sky Immortal level was no longer this unachievable terrain for the Lower Three Realms. Although breaking through to that level was still difficult, it was no longer nigh impossible as it was before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And because of that, the Immortal Region had a great increase in strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everybody had begun to say that it was now the golden age for the Three Realms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I knew you were drinking here,” Stone chuckled as he descended from the sky. He walked over to Ye Zichen’s side and snatched the flagon and took a sip.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Meh, it’s a bit worse than Erguotou,” Stone wiped his lips and handed the flagon back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unlike Stone, Xue Qi still kept himself at a distance from Ye Zichen due to their status.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had told him to relax countless times, but he always laughed it off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then remained the same.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After telling Xue Qi that several times, Ye Zichen finally gave up. However, that did not mean that he did not think of Xue Qi as an equal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why’re you guys here? Is the Treasure Tower not busy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the past six months, Ye Zichen got his Leisure House to merge with the Treasure Tower.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After being through so much, he started caring a lot less about a faction of his own. What’s more, if he really needed a faction…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The entire Immortal Region would bend to his will.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, Zuo Mo needed some trustworthy helpers, so Ye Zichen told the Leisure House folks to go and help her with the Treasure Tower’s business.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Xue Qi and Stone looked at each other meaningfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows, “Is Zuo Mo looking for me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two continued to smile meaningfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those from Leisure House had always felt that Ye Zichen had something going on with Zuo Mo, that’s why they didn’t mind working as her subordinates at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From their perspective, there was no difference between working for their boss or their boss’s wife.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, she was also very rich.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the pair said nothing, Ye Zichen still knew that Zuo Mo was looking for him, since there was no other reason for them to act like that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since he knew that they wouldn’t believe him if he tried to explain his relationship with Zuo Mo, he chose to keep quiet and merely shrugged, “Where is she now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mistress, no, Young Mistress is waiting for you at the Treasure Tower headquarters in Maple City,” while it seemed like Stone made a careless mistake, Ye Zichen knew full well that Stone was just making fun of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was also blatantly obvious from Que Xi’s attempt to not burst out laughing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes, then leaped into the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, wait for us!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the Treasure Tower headquarters in Maple City.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had always been someone to only use those he cared for and trusted. When his identity as the Yellow Emperor was revealed, he gained a huge amount of respect from everyone in the outer regions of the Immortal region!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Due to that, Ye Zichen naturally used his contacts to triple the strength of the Treasure Tower.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the headquarters in Maple City was not the main one, there were no less merchants than in the Treasure Tower’s main headquarters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s why Ye Zichen had no choice but to walk in with a straw hat covering his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had forcefully stopped construction of statues of himself in the various Immortal Region cities, but that didn’t stop the people from finding out about him. Everyone would not greet him with the utmost respect they had for him. Moreover, there were often fans who would yell insensible things at him every so often. He really couldn’t stand it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was why he finally understood why celebrities would cover themselves from head to toe when they went out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had no choice, the fans were truly too passionate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lady Zuo, I feel like we can still discuss a bit more about the price,” a chubby-looking merchant smiled. He did not dare to try and lay hands on Zuo Mo at all. Not only was Zuo Mo the future successor of the Treasure Tower, she still had a man backing her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were many rumors talking about how her man was the Yellow Emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master Li, you should know that the Treasure Tower has always been trustworthy. We never force low prices amongst others. Yes, we do accept negotiations, but the price you are asking for is too high.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Mo was wearing a plain delicate dress that showed off her body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was negotiating for a huge business deal and she negotiated with the merchant in front of her for a long time. At that moment, they were at a critical point of discussion. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw a hooded man waving towards her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Mo’s eyes lit up, she turned back to the merchant, “Master Li, please excuse me for a moment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Normally speaking, Zuo Mo would never leave such an important customer hanging. She would treat all customers with equal respect, but right now…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did you come over with such a large straw hat covering your face?” Zuo Mo skipped over with a giggle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man took off the hat with a wry smile, “I can’t help it. I’m sure you know how famous I am right now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The slightly angry merchant immediately hide his dark look when he saw the hooded man’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes, the merchant was famous, but when compared to the reincarnation of the Yellow Emperor and savior of the Three Realms…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was nothing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He merely looked around as he thought to himself.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So the rumors are true. Then should I try to flatter them? Maybe I’ll lower the selling price a little?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>But he didn’t want to.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Merchants cared about profit all the time. He was definitely willing to raise the price, but lowering the price was like taking a bite out of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He really had to give a deep thought for what he should do.</span></p>
