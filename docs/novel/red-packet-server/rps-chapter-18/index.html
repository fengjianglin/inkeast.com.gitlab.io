 <p><span style>Chapter 18 – Buying a useless piece of rock</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Expert Liu, didn’t you say that this ore would definitely give out jade?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Ye Zichen looked at the grey and white face that had been cut, Ye Zichen revealed a mocking smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No one will know what the result will be until the very end.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Liu replied forcefully. Meanwhile, Director Bai had also started the second cut.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was still showing a grey and white face without a single hint of green.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He lost, definitely lost.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cut again!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was still a grey and white face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cut again!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the second cut, the many experienced people already knew that he had definitely lost the bet on this ore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Director Bai didn’t believe it, he couldn’t believe that such a promising ore was actually a piece of useless rock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After six cuts, the huge ore fell into pieces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only at this moment did Director Bai looked at the pieces on the floor with a dark expression without saying anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Director Bai is truly bold, actually spending several tens of millions to buy a useless piece of rock. He definitely is a prime example for our industry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Xiao Yumei saw that the rock really didn’t give out any jade, she did not forget to verbally attack Director Bai, that one who had been opposing her everywhere, who was being shocked about Ye Zichen’s ability.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, Xiao Yumei, don’t be so full of yourself. I did lose when gambling on this stone, but I can afford it. But you? If you don’t manage to buy good jade, then your jewelry chain can sit and wait for its closure.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Director Bai snorted, then left from the crowd. Due to his words, Xiao Yumei’s originally good mood was ruined.</span></p>
 <p><span style>True, if she doesn’t manage to buy some good rocks, then…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Expert Liu, why did the rock not give out any jade?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen didn’t know why, but he just didn’t like the look of this expert, so walked in front of him and mocked him a little when the rock had been completely cut…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stone gambling relies on luck, by the appearance of that rock, it should gave given out jade, but who could have known that it was just on the surface and that it tricked everyone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t find so many excuses if you just aren’t educated enough. Why did this rock not trick me?” Ye Zichen twitched his mouth. “Just now I said that the rock would not give out jade, I wonder who it was that retorted against me so angrily!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young man, this old man had been in the circle for ten-odd years, I’ve seen more ores than the number of grains of rice you have eaten. You only got it right once, don’t be so cocky.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Liu replied with the tone of a senior teaching a junior a lesson. Ye Zichen shrugged, then looked around at the different ores.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A piece of black and square ore caught Ye Zichen’s eye. This rock wasn’t small and was at least a hundred kilograms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it had no patterns and did not show any greenness. It had clearly become a useless rock in the eyes of everyone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What does Elder Liu think about this rock?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A mere piece of useless rock.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Liu replied with a careless glance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Director Xiao,” Ye Zichen waved towards Xiao Yumei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, I didn’t manage to thank you yet. It was fortunate that you told me not to buy that piece of rock, otherwise, I really would have lost everything.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Director Xiao is too courteous.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop calling me Director Xiao. It seems like I’m a bit older than you. If you don’t mind, then call me Mei-jie.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen truly had helped her out a lot, she only had a bit more than forty million in liquid assets, if she bought and lost the bet on that rock, she might have already committed suicide.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mei-jie.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen wasn’t a fool, other people couldn’t even begin to wish for such a beautiful older sister.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha, look and see if there is any ores you like here. Older sister will buy one for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sis, buy this one.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pointed at that square and black rock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This one?” Xiao Yumei frowned. Although she didn’t know how to select rocks, she did understand some of the basics.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This rock was clearly an useless piece of rock. If they bought it, they would definitely lose on it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That rock is clearly an useless piece of rock. How about sis helping you pick another one? Don’t worry, sis will pay for you,” Xiao Yumei said in goodwill. Ye Zichen helped her out many times, and had refused money in return, so she wanted to repay him through other means.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need, it looking promising doesn’t mean that it will give out jade. Wasn’t the one just now a good lesson?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Ye Zichen said that, Director Bai and Elder Liu, who were not far away clearly tensed up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei also nodded with a smile. Since Ye Zichen wanted to buy this one, then she’d buy it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll take this piece of rock.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei handed the card over. When Elder Liu saw that, he couldn’t help but shake his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It would be weird the company doesn’t go bankrupted when you don’t use money in the right places.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Elder Liu, watch your tongue,” Xiao Yumei said coldly. She didn’t have time to deal with this old man yet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His random picking nearly caused her to lose everything. However, she didn’t cause trouble for him, she never would have thought that he would say these sort of depressing things in front of her again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Director Bai, who had lost a lot of money just now from stone gambling, also laughed coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Director Xiao, the jewelry stores couldn’t have given you too much pressure, causing you to go mad, right? You are actually buying a piece of useless rock?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Director Bai, right?” Ye Zichen glanced at Director Bai and said. “Director Bai was quite right in the head just now, you used several tens of millions to buy a useless piece of rock. Truly bold!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Say that again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Ye Zichen mentioned his sore spot, Director Bai nearly coughed up blood due to his anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He raised his finger and pointed at Ye Zichen’s nose, but then he heard a cold laugh beside him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you don’t want your finger to leave your hand, then take your hand back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young-Young Master Su!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person that spoke up for Ye Zichen just now was of course Su Yiyun. When Director Bai saw him, it was like a mouse seeing a cat, since his entire forehead was quickly covered in sweat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My bro can buy whatever he wants to buy, how is it any of your business? You think you have a good judgement after using several tens of millions to buy a piece of useless rock? I’m telling you, even if my bro bets wrongly, I can afford the loss!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Su is right!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck off!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun chased Director Bai away. Seeing that, Xiao Yumei was still in shock as she looked at Su Yiyun, who was walking towards them, and said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Su.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Director Xiao!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun’s attitude towards Xiao Yumei was also very friendly due to Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn’t think that Zichen was actually Young Master Su’s friend, it seems like older sister was stupid, I actually wanted to help you buy an ore. You could easily buy the ore yourself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei took a step back, but Ye Zichen shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mei-jie, I’m just a poor student. I definitely cannot afford such a large piece of ore. You buy it for me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A strange look flashed across Su Yiyun’s eyes. He did understand Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Ye Zichen liked to con people, he definitely wouldn’t do it to people he was familiar with.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, he had at least five million in his card, this unpromising looking rock was at most four thousand per kilogram, he could easily afford it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, Ye Zichen chose to get Xiao Yumei to buy this rock. </span><i><span style>Could it be that this rock would give out jade?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, then older sister will buy it for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei did not hesitate and directly bought the ore for Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think that you deliberately came to con Director Xiao’s money.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Liu said darkly once again. Ye Zichen merely smiled in reply and called the stonecutter over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cut the rock!”</span></p>
