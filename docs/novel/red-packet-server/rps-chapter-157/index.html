 <p><span style>Chapter 157 – The Lin Family</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen took a taxi over to the meeting spot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great Sage Sun, don’t speak recklessly later. Just stay there obediently.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen said slightly worriedly towards Great Sage Sun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He really was afraid that Great Sage Sun would go like “I, Old Sun” and “kill Yao”…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He really couldn’t deal with that!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, I, Old Sun, understand. I, Old Sun, will just not speak.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Great Sage Sun shook his hand as if he didn’t care. Then, Ye Zichen repeatedly reminded him not to speak carelessly again, then walked towards the manor in front of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you come here for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment they walked up to the gate, a man, wearing a security uniform and holding a walkie talkie, walked over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wu Haoyu told me to come.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wu Haoyu?” The security guard frowned. “There isn’t anyone called Wu Haoyu here. Hurry up and go to where you’re supposed to be.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, a guard’s so arrogant now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen tilted his head, and looked at the guard with a face full of mockery.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandson, hurry up and f*ck off…” The guard pointed the walkie talkie in Ye Zichen’s face. “The Lin family home isn’t a place for you to cause trouble!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Lin family!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled. Wu Haoyu had told him that his family’s old man, causing him to think that it was the old man of the Wu family.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>From the looks of it, the brat treated Lin Ru as his family already.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen didn’t think that despite him looking so honest, he was rather witty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shook his head with a smile. When the guard in front of him waved his hand to tell him to leave with an impatient expression, Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows, “You don’t know Wu Haoyu, but you should know Lin Ru, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The guard’s expression tensed when Lin Ru was mentioned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>How could he not know Lin Ru? That was the young mistress of them, the Lin family!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems like you know her. I know Lin Ru. Let me in.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You?” The guard revealed a mocking smile. “Taking a taxi to our Lin family, and wearing just street side clothes that are not even worth two thousand yuan. You said that you know our Young Mistress?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you going to let…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Great Sage felt a bit impatient as he scratched his face and glared at the guard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Great Sage turned into the fighter at Di Tian’s mansion, he was definitely quite a bit buffer than the security guard in front of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The security guard took a step back subconsciously, and glared at them sinisterly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Group A, Group B, someone is causing trouble at the front gate. Requesting backup.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You truly are snobbish,” Ye Zichen sighed, then licked his lips with a smile. “I had wanted to negotiate properly with you, but you are unwilling…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little brat, this lord is saying this now, if you don’t want to suffer, then hurry up and f*ck off!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The security guard clearly had a temper, and he also felt like he had a reason to act like that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those people came to the Lin family home without a car, and dressed pitifully cheaply. Someone of this level definitely could not know a Lin family member.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just what kind of family was the Lin family?</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a huge family that had contacts in the business world, the political world and even the military.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The people that came to this mansion were either rich or powerful, someone like Ye Zichen…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Could not possibly have gotten into contact with the Lin family!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Buzz…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s phone rang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Zichen, you’re still not here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Haoyu clearly sounded anxious on the phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen glanced at the guard in front of him playfully, “I got stopped by the guard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What!? I’m coming out to get you now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, two figures walked out from the manor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One of the figures walked rather hurriedly, while the other clearly seemed rather casual.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Haoyu quickly ran over, then took a glance at the guard, who was on the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You really are blind, daring to stop anyone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, Haoyu, why are you so angry?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, playful laughter sounded out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked up, and saw a soft-faced teenager walk out from the manor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Second Young Master.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The security guard quickly bowed in respect. The teenager nodded in response, “Go on, it’s none of your business here now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, sir!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The guard respectfully left from the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After that, Wu Haoyu squinted his eyes, “Lin Lin, what’s this supposed to mean? That guard was disrespectful to my friend, and even stopped him from entering, you’re just letting him off like that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Was our security guard wrong?” Lin Lin smiled mockingly. He took a few more glances at Ye Zichen, after which the disdain in his eyes became even more apparent. “Wu Haoyu, do you think anyone can come into the Lin family home? Even our family’s servants dresses better than this brat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he smiled in disdain, “Also, don’t say ‘your friend’ over and over again. If it wasn’t because my lil’ sis is determined to date you, do you think your Wu family’s tiny bit of money can get into contact with us, the Lin family?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Anger surfaced on Wu Haoyu’s honest face. He glared straight at Lin Lin and suppressed his anger, “Ye Zichen is a qigong master. I asked him to come here to treat Old Man Lin.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qigong master?” Lin Lin smiled mockingly, then looked at Ye Zichen. “Him? Qigong master? Can you not crack a joke! We, the Lin family, understands your good will, but someone is able to cure the old man. We came back to Bingcheng this time to get the old man treated. Your friend can just go to the side!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lin…” Wu Haoyu wanted to continue to argue, but Ye Zichen grabbed his shoulders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Ye Zichen shook his head and looked towards Lin Lin, who was standing on the side cockily, “Very good, very powerful.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? From the looks of it, you’re very annoyed?” Lin Lin laughed with disdain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded, “Of course I’m annoyed for being looked down upon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then keep being annoyed. I love seeing people eat shit,” Lin Lin’s words were completely blunt, and it could be said that there was no more need to go around corners.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandson, how the f*ck are you talking to my boss? Do you believe that I’ll slap you into the wall with a slap, so that you can’t be pulled out?” Third Fatty Jin glared at him angrily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, the Great Sage also stepped forward fiercely and bared his teeth, “Hey, little fellow, I…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pulled Great Sage back. Meanwhile, Lin Lin raised his eyebrows and said with disdain, “You didn’t even hire a good fighter. I, I, I, I, what? And you, fatty, say that one more time…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So what if I, Lord Fatty, f*cking says it one more time? Laozi…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop talking,” Ye Zichen said softly, causing Third Fatty Jin to instantly purse his lips and take a step back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it wasn’t a peaceful society, Ye ZIchen would definitely slap this grandson a few times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The guy was truly lucky to have his family. Otherwise, he would have been beaten to death with his personality.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, a small buggy stopped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ru jumped out from the car and ran straight to Wu Haoyu’s side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haoyu, are you looking for me? Oh? Su Yan’s boyfriend, Ye Zichen, why are you here? C’mon, don’t stand here, go in and play!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ru had a very deep impression of Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Never mind,” Ye Zichen shook his head with a smile, then glanced over at Lin Lin. “A small fry like me shouldn’t recklessly enter the gates of your Lin family. Good bye!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Wu Haoyu also shrugged off Lin Ru’s hand with a smile, “I’m leaving too.”</span></p>
