 <p><span style>Chapter 93 – Bet</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Wan looked up dumbly. She didn’t think that the situation would turn out like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though she clearly worked up her confidence in order for him to see her determination in order to invite him into the team…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He actually didn’t want Xia Keke to play for her either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Keke has her own thoughts, what right do you have for making decision for her!” Jing Wan bit her lips as anger surfaced on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m doing this to for your team and for Xia Keke. She’s definitely not suited for this sort of profession. If your team has her, you might not even be able to make it through the bracket stage.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Good advice sounds terrible, this phrase definitely had logic to it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For example, Ye Zichen was definitely saying these things to Jing Wan for her good, but she clearly couldn’t accept it right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Wan bit her lips as her eyes shone. After a long while, she lifted her head as if she made her decision and looked at Ye Zichen with a resolute gaze, “Follow me to the base.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was completely shocked when he saw the base for Jing Wan’s team.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He only truly felt the determination of Jing Wan wanting to establish her own team at that very moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen thought an apartment would be pretty nice for a base, but Jing Wan got an entire mansion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What made him even more speechless was that, this mansion…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was right opposite his home!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was facing his front entrance. He was rather worried that Lil’ White would come even when Lil’ White smelled his scent with his dog nose.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How is it? The position is pretty good, right?” Jing Wan lifted her delicate chin proudly. Ye Zichen smiled without denying it, and quickly urged her. “Hurry in.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmph, alright.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pride gradually surfaced on Jing Wan’s face, she innocently thought that it was the base which she chose that shocked Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Would told you to put on airs every single time. I’ll definitely shock you even more after we go in.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Wan thought proudly in her heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Keke, do you remember what you said just now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a long-haired boy wearing glasses sitting beside Xie Keke. He looked around seventeen or eighteen, and neither the innocence nor naivety had faded from his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know what I said to you just now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke pushed the keyboard forward, stood up from the chair and walked towards the living room sofa.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The boy hurried over to grab Xia Keke’s arm, “Keke, you can’t break your promise. Didn’t you say that you like people that are better than you at games? I won three out of five in the solo matches just now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Di Xinpeng, I only said like. I didn’t say that I would like you after you win.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then why did you play with me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have never refused someone asking me to solo.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke pouted. She had just casually said it earlier, and only instantly agreed to the match due to her personality.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She didn’t think that a thoughtless phrase would cause Di Xinpeng to have such a huge reaction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I… You…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Anger begun to rise on Di Xinpeng’s childish face. He pointed at her, but was not able to utter a word.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke twitched her mouth, then slowly moved towards the mansion door, “I’ll telling you, don’t think of doing anything to me. I have a boyfriend, if you dare to do anything to you, he won’t let you off.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke inched towards the door as she tried to comfort Di Xinpeng’s feelings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The retreating Xia Keke bumped into Jing Wan and Ye Zichen who just entered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ouch, who is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke looked back with a frown. When she saw the helpless looking Ye Zichen, she immediately leaped towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did you come?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen scratched his head when he felt the joy in Xia Keke’s tone. However, then he felt the hospitality not that far away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are Xia Keke’s boyfriend?” Di Xinpeng pursed his lips, while intense flames burned in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was stunned, but Xia Keke, who was in his arms, raised her chin, “Yeah, he’s my boyfriend, he’s ten thousand times better than you in games.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then let’s compete.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two of them immediately started opposing each other with an intense smell of gunpowder without either of them asking Ye Zichen’s opinion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at the conflicting people in confusion, “What’s going on?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, Xia Keke immediately told Ye Zichen everything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment she finished, Ye Zichen did not accept the fight, nor did he talk about their childishness. He merely looked towards Jing Wan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“See? This is but one of the issues. Xia Keke definitely cannot join your team. I think you should find another player.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Wan didn’t think that such an issue would arise from the time she wasn’t here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, why aren’t you letting Xia Keke join this team?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Di Xinpeng was immediately unhappy before Jing Wan replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t this obvious? There is someone with ill intentions like you in the team, can I let my girlfriend come here to face the danger?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes speechlessly. Hearing that he admitted her as his girlfriend, Xia KeKe immediately blushed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your affability level with Xia Keke increased by 50. Current affability level: 220.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Di Xinpeng was immediately turned speechless by Ye Zichen. He was interested in Xia Keke, rather, it was love at first sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He immediately felt his heart stolen when he saw Xia Keke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To be honest, it was just because this brat played too many games, and it was the first time he saw a girl saw a girl as pretty as Xia Keke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was normal for him to be moved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Di Xinpeng wasn’t willing to give up, he clenched his teeth, “The fact that you can be Keke’s boyfriend means that you should be pretty good at playing games. Let’s compete, best of three. If I win, then you quit, if you win then I quit!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Young people were young.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen laughed after hearing Di Xinpeng’s words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What sort of nice dreams are you having?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows and put his arm around Xia Keke’s waist. “This is my girlfriend, the heck does she have to do with you. Yet you’re shamelessly saying that you’ll quit. It has nothing to do with you, okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your affability level with Xia Keke increased by 50. Current affability level: 270.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what do you want?” Di Xinpeng’s face turned pale upon hearing Ye Zichen’s words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothing much, I don’t want to compete with you. You can’t beat me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, compete with him,” Xia Keke suddenly spoke up. She pouted, “I lost to him in a solo match. Help me win it back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was truly speechless facing Xia Keke’s desire for victory.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He subconsciously looked towards Jing Wan and sighed, as if he was saying…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Do you see this? This is Xia Keke, and you still want her to play in professional games?</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Di Xinpeng, who still didn’t give up, added, “Yeah, you’re Keke’s boyfriend, so help her win it back. What’s a man that can’t protect his woman…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was speechless once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was too childish.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no helping it, Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows, “Didi, are you underage?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Di Xinpeng blushed for an unknown reason and snorted, “I’ll be an adult very soon. Don’t change the topic, are you competing or not?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at Di Xinpeng’s expression of not giving up until he loses and Xia Keke’s gaze of anticipation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shrugged with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then let’s compete, but we have to change the stakes.”</span></p>
