 <p><span style>Chapter 257 – Ore Trading Center</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wei Chen looked at the fallen man with a human’s body and snake tail with a shake of his head. A slither of smoke blew out from his mouth. Only half of his cigarette had been burnt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yellow Emperor’s life is truly filled with disasters, even half-beastmen came. It seems like I have to find some helpers, otherwise, I won’t be able to defend him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Wei Chen chucked the cigarette beside the half-beastmen’s body and left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, two men appeared by the half-beastman’s side. They glanced at the cigarette, that was still smoking, and the dead half-beastmen on the ground, then dialed a number.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Number Three mission failed. Recovering him now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the next day, Ye Zichen took Mu Chuang to the jewelry store.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Ye.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Dahai’s face was covered in a smile. Since Ye Zichen completely handed the jewelry stores to him, he didn’t have to follow other people’s decisions, making him the boss of the jewelry stores, so his recent days have been very comfortable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ve lived a good life recently. You got fatter again,” Ye Zichen patted his shoulders with a faint smile. “Oh yeah, let me introduce someone to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Ye Zichen pointed at Mu Chuang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is the helper I got for you, Mu Chuang! Didn’t Yumei take Li Shuang to the medical company, he can stay here to assist you, and learn from you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem, no problem!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>People that Ye Zichen brought over in person was definitely royalty. </span></i><span style>Bai Dahai was an intelligent person, so he quickly smiled, “Recently, I’ve been looking for an assistant. Thank you so much, Young Master Ye.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled and eyed Mu Chuang, “This is the general manager of our jewelry store, Director Bai, Bai Dahai! Just follow him from now on!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Director Bai.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chuang and Bai Dahai nodded towards each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen wandered around the store a few times, then raised his eyebrows, “How has business been recently?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s been pretty good. It’s just that we don’t have much ore left on hand, so we have to control the amount we put out,” Bai Dahai replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Control for what? Is there an ore trade today?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Dahai’s heart leaped when he heard that. </span><i><span style>Is this master going to make a move again?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>This is definitely great news!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, yes, yes. I just received an invitation to an ore trade a few days ago. Young Master Ye, are you going…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, I have nothing better to do.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, sure!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Dahai and Ye Zichen left Mu Chuang at the jewelry store, then the former gave some orders to the store’s manager and supervisor before driving Ye Zichen to the ore trading center.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Plenty of people recognized Ye Zichen the moment they entered the hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mr. Ye, I wonder if you can sell me a few pieces this time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mr. Ye, I can use a high price to…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mr. Ye…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>More and more people begun to surround them. That was inevitable, since Ye Zichen had swept up goods way too fiercely a while ago in the stone gambling circles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since he managed to get it right every single time, he was already called a god.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on over there?” Han Yu looked at the crowd with a frown. He did have a jewelry store of a decent size that was subsidiary to his company, so he had come with an invitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I heard Stone God or something. It should be someone that’s rather good a stone gambling,” The expert beside Han Yu frowned slightly, then smiled. “It is impossible for a person to get jade every single time when stone gambling. That Stone God is probably coined due to exaggeration.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s true,” Han Yu nodded. </span><i><span style>After all, nobody had x-ray vision to be able to see what was in the stone.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Stone gambling was all luck, although experience was also very important…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>However, no matter how experience the person, they will get it wrong a few times.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Just as he shook his head and was about to leave, a laughter sounded out behind Han Yu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Han, what a coincidence, I actually bumped into you here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled playfully, but his eyes were completely cold. </span><i><span style>This brat nearly took my life yesterday!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Ye?” Han Yu raised his eyebrows, then couldn’t help but be shocked when he saw the people around Ye Zichen. “Young Master Ye is that stone god?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems like it!” Ye Zichen eyed the people around him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s reply truly surprised him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Experience from stone gambling needed to be built up. At such a young age…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yu hid the astonishment in his heart, then said respectfully, “Young Master Ye, that is truly admirable.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, speaking of admiration, I admire Young Master Han quite a lot. I was terribly shocked by the huge present you sent me yesterday,” Ye Zichen smiled coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yu put on a look of confusion, “What present?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pretend, keep pretending!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had pretty much cursed all eighteen generations of Han Yu’s ancestors, but he couldn’t do anything if Han Yu didn’t admit it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had no proof that Han Yu did it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But the chances were over eighty percent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled faintly and did not continue down the topic. Instead, he glanced at the stone gambling expert beside Han Yu, “Geezer Liu, we meet again!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Expert Liu’s face immediately darkened when he saw that playful smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it wasn’t for the brat in front of his eyes, he might still be receiving the best treatment in Xiao Yumei’s jewelry shop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph,” Expert Liu snorted coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows with a smile, “So angry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You know each other?” Han Yu raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shrugged, “We’ve met when stone gambling before. This Expert Liu is a titan-class person in the stone gambling scene. Young Master Han has found a prize!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he glanced at Expert Liu, “I hope Expert Liu can help Young Master Han pick a few good stones that can open up green.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, he walked into the ore auction area.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yu squinted his eyes with a smile, “Come, let’s follow him and see.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen arrived at the trading area, he naturally met another group of people that respectfully begged him for stone. After he nodded in response to their demands with a smile, Ye Zichen’s eyes flashed with a gold light…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Fiery Eyes of Truth, activate!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“This stone can open up jade, who wants it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pointed to a stone covered in moss. Since he had the Fiery Eyes of Truth, he didn’t have to look all over the place like other experts. He was able to tell whether a stone could open up jade with a single glance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Ye, I want this stone!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Screw off, I’m going to take it. Young Master Ye, let me buy it, I can give you a consultation fee!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want it…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want it…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the jewelry business men surrounded him like locusts after hearing Ye Zichen’s words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Yu was also stunned. </span><i><span style>He picked it so quickly. </span></i><span style>However, what made Han Yu even more speechless was that those jewelry businessmen started to fight over it without thinking at all.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Weren’t they afraid of it not opening up jade and losing the bet?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t be anxious, take it slowly. Everybody has a chance!” Ye Zichen smiled, then picked twenty-odd more stones, which those jewelry businessmen snatched away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everyone, are you not afraid of it not opening up to anything?” Han Yu couldn’t help but ask.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The businessmen nearby looked at him as if they were looking at a retard. If it wasn’t due to Han Yu’s position, some people might have even started to scold him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen merely smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Open them, show Young Master Han whether you guys won or lost the gamble!”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Original Chapter Teaser:</b>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Ahhh, life's great now. Submitting to Young Master Ye was definitely the best decision I've ever made in my career. Sure, I'm not the big boss of my own company anymore, but the size of this new jewelry company is so much larger. Also, not only is my position only under two people, neither of them actually sticks their hands here! Both Young Master Ye and Director Xiao just lets me run the show completely!</p>
 <p>Argh, there is a problem though, We're running very low on ores, so we have to limit sales. That's not exactly good for the company.</p>
 <p>There is a stone gambling event today, but none of us are like Young Master Ye. We're nowhere as good as he is when it comes to that, so we'll only be able to get enough to continue the business...</p>
 <p>Wait, speak of the devil! Ahh, Young Master Ye is here!</p>
 <p>Hmm... Who's that kid with him? His relative? Maybe his little brother or a cousin?</p>
