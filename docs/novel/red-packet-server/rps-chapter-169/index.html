 <p><span style>Chapter 169 – New Function activated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ta! Ta!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ten-odd subordinates also imitated yellow-hair and saluted after the latter did it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hello, Boss’s Boss!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was speechless.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>There was something wrong with this yellow hair’s brain, why are all his subordinates the same as well?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Even if they didn’t find it shameful, Ye Zichen did.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen quickly dragged down yellow hair’s hand as the bystanders started to point at them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, what is it, do you have some sort of mission for me? I’m ready any time!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yellow hair stomped onto the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he displayed an expression as if he was willing to sacrifice himself for the organization at any moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Be more f*cking normal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh,” yellow-hair answered dumbly. Then he took a peek at the surrounding bystanders and leaned close to Ye Zichen’s ear. “Boss, I understand, we can’t leak the news of us, the Namekians, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was truly defeated by stupidity of this dumb brat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen no longer wanted to explain anything, and merely nodded. He’ll just act as if the brat was right.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You… Come over here,” Yellow-hair pointed at red-hair, who was completely dumbfounded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Red-hair immediately walked over timidly as he held his arm, “Boss.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry up and apologize to Big Boss,” Yellow hair kicked red-hair on his butt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Red-hair tripped and nearly kneeled down onto the floor, “Big Boss, I was wrong, I shouldn’t have caused trouble for Sis…”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Sis!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qianqian blushed, while Su Yan and Xia Keke were both shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sensing the weird atmosphere, Ye Zichen kicked red-hair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t say things recklessly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yellow hair clearly felt the weirdness of the atmosphere as well, so he reached out to yank red-hair’s ear, “Are you a f*cking retard? Didn’t you see that there are two more Sisses on the side? Big Boss’s relationship with this Sis is clearly an underground relationship. Aren’t you just making Big Boss look terrible to blatantly say it outloud like this!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yellow-hair wasn’t subtle when he spoke at all…</span></p>
 <p><span style>His voice caused even the bystanders to hear everything clearly.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck you!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Who exactly is the one making me look bad!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>What made Ye Zichen even more speechless was…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, I educated this brat now. From now on, we’ll definitely help you keep your secrets properly from now on.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Creak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clenched his teeth with force.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*cking f*ck off!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>While yellow-hair’s subordinates were outside cleaning the black dog blood, he stayed beside Ye Zichen and fanned Ye Zichen with a small fan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, why haven’t there been any actions from the androids recently?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who was drinking water, spat out his mouthful of water.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This brat was truly determined.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“When I transformed into a Super Saiyan earlier, I beat him up, so he didn’t dare to do anything.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss transformed! It’s such a pity that I didn’t see it in person!” yellow-hair said sadly. “However, leaving the androids here is still going to bring trouble, why didn’t you directly eliminate him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A peaceful society, peaceful life… My wish is for world peace!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss’s mentality is truly not something us mortals can compare to.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yellow hair flattered exaggeratedly. At the same time, Ye Zichen already didn’t want to say anything about this brat’s idiocy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, it’s been cleaned.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let me take a look?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yellow hair placed his fan into his subordinate’s hands, then went to the entrance to check a few times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Liu Qianqian and co. also walked over and bit her lips, “Ye Zichen, thank you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Red hair also walked over with his head lowered, while holding his arm, “Big Boss.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm, bring your arm over.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He raised his arm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Snap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen put red hair’s arm down, then stood up from the chair and swept his gaze across yellow hair and red hair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Although you said that you cleaned up the entrance, but…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gulp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Red hair gulped, while Ye Zichen turned his gaze towards yellow-hair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have a reputation on this Antique Street, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s alright, it’s enough for me to feed myself,” yellow hair scratched his head and smiled coyly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen nodded, “Alright, then be free fighters for this pawn shop from now on.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem,” yellow hair answered without thinking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Liu Qianqian, who was on the side, was shocked, “What are you doing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you so dense?” Ye Zichen raised his hand and knocked on Liu Qianqian’s head. “The Antique Street has all sorts of people, just let them do some of the things that aren’t going to be convenient for you guys to do, it’s free as well… You’re just so dumb.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, yeah, we’re free,” yellow hair also answered on the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen facepalmed.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This yellow hair…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wow!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Su Yan walked over with a smile, while a ring was on her finger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked towards Xia Keke…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It wasn’t me that gave it to Susu, she snatched it from me,” Xia Keke said with a troubled expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen gulped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This ring is so pretty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan raised her hand under the sunlight, causing the ring to sparkle. However, Ye Zichen could feel from her expression…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll buy one for you tomorrow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really?” Su Yan smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen thought of her weird expression just now, he couldn’t help but nod like a chick pecking rice, “Definitely.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s more like it,” Su Yan smirked, then returned the ring to Xia Keke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Marriage string received.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the hell?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why did I get a marriage string?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Both Su Yan and Xia Keke were linked on a string with me?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could it be Liu Qianqian?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at Liu Qianqian, who was standing on the side. </span><i><span style>She didn’t seem to be linked with me.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen opened the Treasure Chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Marriage String.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Possessor: Han Xiangzi. Possessed: Immortal Lady He.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Current affability level: 50.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Confusion!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was completely confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Xiangzi: Great deity, great deity, great news!</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen received Han Xiangzi’s message, he naturally knew what the great news was, since he had already received their marriage string.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Congratulations! You lovers finally ended up together.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great deity already knows?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Xiangzi was surprised. His relationship with Immortal Lady He was just confirmed, even the others of the Eight Immortals, who lived with them, didn’t know.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What can hide from this sovereign? I know you want to share your joy with me, but hurry up and just accompany Immortal Lady He.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay celestial sovereign. Thank you so much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your intimacy level with Immortal Lady He increased by 100. Current intimacy level: 200.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Intimacy level levelled up to Trusted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bringing one Heavenly Court couple together. Intimacy level with both has reached Trusted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lovers ended up together. You received Reputation: 1.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reputation mode activated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reputation Plate x1. It has been added to the Treasure Chest.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>A new function activated.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen quickly went to check what exactly was this Reputation. However, at that moment, Blackie, whose face was swollen, floated down from the sky with a sob.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, hurry up and return to the supermarket to take a look…”</span></p>
