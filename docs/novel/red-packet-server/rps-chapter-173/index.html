 <p><span style>Chapter 173 – Immortal Heart of Pure Yang Upgrade</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within the underworld.</span></p>
 <p><span style>White Impermanence dangled her legs as she laid on the bed, while thinking about Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A mortal that could communicate with people from the Heavenly Court and the Underworld. Even the Ten Yama Kings that she felt were so high up had to treat him with courtesy.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just who is he?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>White Impermanence thought to herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Buzz.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her phone vibrated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A notification indicating that her red packet had been received appeared on the screen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She quickly turned around to lie on the bed, then sent out a message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Ye Zichen was getting confused about the red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Heaven and Earth Merits were fine, that should be something similar to cultivation experience.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>But what the hell is this Soul-Restraining Lock?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m here, what the hell is the thing that you sent me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“King Yanluo gave it to me, they seem to want to apologize to you through me. So, I thought about it and gave it all to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was completely confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These might be good things, but in the end, they were useless to Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ignoring Heaven and Earth Merits…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since he didn’t know what they could be used for aside from increasing his official position in the Underworld.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Soul-Restraining Lock.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>There was even less of a need to talk about that. He couldn’t exactly use this thingy to hook out someone’s soul, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, no matter what, White Impermanence sent them over in goodwill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you, thank you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your welcome.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A photo suddenly appeared on the screen of his phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman in the photo merely wore a traditional Chinese bodice, while her figure was… truly excellent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s so boring at night.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ugh.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nearly coughed up blood.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s with White Impermanence?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“It is really boring, but I have to rest now. As for that King Yanluo, tell him to hurry up and give me the fragment of Soul Pearl Yiyuan. It isn’t a big deal for me, but the Great Sage might be very unhappy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment he sent it, Ye Zichen hurriedly closed their chat.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Was the plot of “Ghost” going to f*cking happen!?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>And she’s a married woman.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style><span>Wouldn’t I become the Old Ye next door? <a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></span></span></i></p>
 <p><span style>White Impermanence felt a bit of disappointment when she saw the message, then checked out the reflection of her beautiful figure through a bronze mirror.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Am I not beautiful?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Playboy demon! You aren’t even letting ghosts off!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing laid beside Ye Zichen and twitched her mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, be more reasonable. I’ve never tried to chat her up,” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes, then looked at Liu Jing, who was lying beside him as a hint of a naughty smile appeared on his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He threw his phone off to the side, then locked Liu Qing’s hands with his hands and pressed her down into the bed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you doing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn’t you say that I’m not even letting ghost girls off? So how can I let such a cute ghost girl beside me go?” Ye Zichen revealed a lecherous gaze and licked his lips as he replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t-Don’t-Don’t-Don’t be impulsive, young man! I’m a ghost girl, a ghost girl…”</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>“So what if you’re a ghost girl? Wasn’t it the same for Ning Choisan and Nip Siusin back then!? <a id="footnoteref-2" href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>”</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>“I-I… Oh yeah, did you use that Immortal Heart of Pure Yang yet!?” Liu Qing’s words immediately turned Ye Zichen serious.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Oh yeah, he still hasn’t used the scripture of Immortal Heart of Pure Yang.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen got off Liu Qing, and took out his phone to open WeChat…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Phew,” Liu Qing let out a long sigh. At the same time, she glared at Ye Zichen, while a unknown hint of disappointment spread through her heart. “Damn pervert!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing frowned angrily at him, then went beside him to look at his phone.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Immortal Heart of Pure Yang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Withdraw.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Would you like to learn Lü Dongbin’s Immortal Heart of Pure Yang? If you have a studied a low leveled Immortal Heart secret technique, it will be replaced.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the hell?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He hasn’t learned any Immortal Heart secret scripture before, so he didn’t think much about it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Confirm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You have learned the secret scripture of Lü Dongbin’s Immortal Heart of Pure Yang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A bar suddenly appeared at where the notifications were.</span></p>
 <p><span style>False Spiritual Body (Experience 0/100)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Current Immortal Heart Level: 1. Experienced gained per day: 1.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Materials needed to increase Immortal Heart to Level 2 are unknown.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wasn’t it the entire secret scripture?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why did it need materials to increase the Immortal Heart level?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows, then went to ask Han Xiangzi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Han Xiangzi.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Han Xiangzi was getting intimate with Immortal Lady He. When he saw Ye Zichen’s message…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The great deity is looking for me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then hurry up and see what’s up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was a true matchmaker for them. If it wasn’t for him, they might not have been able to make their feelings clear to each other even after several thousand years.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Xiangzi nodded, then looked at the message…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great deity!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t the Immortal Heart scripture you gave me the entire thing? Why is there a need for materials to increase its level?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Xiangzi smiled understandingly when he saw this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great deity, you might not know. The secret scripture I gave you is indeed the entire volume. With this volume, there is no need for you to understand the higher level of the Immortal Heart, but you do need materials to increase its level. My Esteemed Master had done the same.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was speechless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He understood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With this set of Immortal Heart secret scriptures, he didn’t have to spend any effort in understanding the higher levels of the Immortal Heart, but he still needed to go and get the materials to increase its level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, go and accompany Immortal Lady He. I’ll gather the materials myself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment he sent it over, Han Xiangzi sent him four red packets.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wedding candies?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was confused, then clicked open the red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thousand year sanders x1</span></p>
 <p><span style>Illusionary Spirit Grass (Level 2) x1</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jade Ganoderma (Level 2) x1</span></p>
 <p><span style>3 grams of Kunpeng Blood</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Celestial Sovereign, I coincidentally have a set of materials to upgrade the Immortal Heart to level 2. I don’t know whether you need it or not, but please accept it as a sign of my good faith.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen also received a notification when Han Xiangzi’s message was sent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your Immortal Heart level can be increased. Would you like to upgrade it?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>False Spiritual Body (Experience 0/100).</span></p>
 <p><span style>Current Immortal Heart Level: 2. Experience gained per day: 2.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Materials needed to increase Immortal Heart to Level 3 is unknown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thanks. Alright, hurry up to accompany Immortal Lady He.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“See you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the level 2 Immortal Heart did not increase anything much, Ye Zichen still felt happy about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only issue was that the unknown materials for level three were rather troublesome.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he knew the materials needed for level three, he might be able to trick the Great Sage and the other deities for a bit to increase the Immortal Heart level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the notifications, the experience bar seemed to be the experience he needed to up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he could upgrade his Immortal Heart to level 9….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then what the heck was a puny False Sky Immortal like the Great Emperor Qingming?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Beat him up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within the Immortal Region.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the Qingming Immortal Manor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Great Emperor Qingming sat cross-legged on a straw cushion, when all of a sudden, he felt his nose itch…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Achoo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Great Emperor Qingming rubbed his nose and frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was impossible for someone of his level to get a cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fuck, which grandson is cursing laozi behind my back?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Great Emperor Qingming twitched his mouth, before concentrating once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He started to form signs with his fingers once again.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just who was the new person that entered the Reputation Leaderboard? Why can’t I figure it out!?</span></i></p>
