 <p><span style>Chapter 330 – My Dear Son</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man who walked down from the second floor wore completely black clothes, while the folded fan was placed at his collar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nobody recognized the man in front of them, nor did they know who was the “son” that he was referring to.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only Ye Zichen…</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he raised his head, he looked at the man in front of him in shock, while his hands trembled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you thinking? Aren’t you happy to see your father?” the man slowly walked towards Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gou Yuzhan and Gu Tian, who were both chasing the crowd in the room, also stopped…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That uncle looks so similar to Ye Zichen,” Gou Yuzhan bumped Gu Tian’s shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Indeed,” Gu Tian nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen!” Lu Lu prodded Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did he return to his senses, while he continued to stare at the man in front of him, “You…”</span></p>
 <p><span style> “Call me dad. Did Gu Rong not even teach you the most basic of manners?” the man maintained his smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gu Rong,” Gu Tian, who was standing behind Ye Zichen was completely shocked. He looked at the man in front of him with surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man smiled faintly as if he felt Gu Tian’s gaze, “Someone from the Gu family is actually here. Why do you have that expression? Could it be that you’re very shocked to hear Gu Rong’s name? Yes, you made no mistake. I’m talking about the original Young Lady of the Gu family, Gu Rong.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Tian was completely dumbfounded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Rong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was a name he had only seen in the family tree, but it was a name which was crossed out by a red line.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had once asked his father why her name was crossed out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reply his father had given him was…</span></p>
 <p><span style>That person was exiled from the Gu family.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even now, he could still remember the wry smile on his father’s face when he gave the answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Gu Tian was shocked, Ye Zichen was even more so.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had always thought that his father was someone from the Gu family, but… </span><i><span style>Why was it mother?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Then, the man in front of me…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why do you have this sort of expression!” the man smiled. “Could it be that you’re shocked from seeing your father? That makes sense. You’ve never ever seen me, so it is natural for you to be shocked from seeing me now. But… I… extremely dislike your current expression.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the hell!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What is this man in front of me saying?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is he really my father? Why don’t I feel any hint of intimacy from him? From the very beginning, the smile on his face was merely a meaningful one.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It was as if I’m not his son at all, and am merely a joke.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>You’re saying that this androgynous man is my father!? What a joke!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m talking to you, my good son.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man suddenly raised his hand. Ye Zichen, who was several meters away from him, felt as if someone was strangling him before he was lifted into the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You really are the same as Gu Rong. I… really don’t like your expression.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh…” Ye Zichen grabbed onto the space in front of his neck tightly, as he tiptoed, and revealed a pain-filled expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man flung his arm with force, causing Ye Zichen to be swung to the corner of the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Ye!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kind shopkeeper!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone ran towards the corner of the room, while Ye Zichen laid on the floor, while intensely coughing and grabbing his neck. Furthermore, they were even able to see a faint line of blood on the corner of his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you… seeking death!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Lu, who squatted on the floor, suddenly stood up. After that, her hair turned a light blue shade, and a ferocious wind begun to spread outwards with her at the center.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within seconds, the wind mixed with ice and snow, turning the entire room into a white world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lu Lu!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who laid limply on the floor, stood up from the ground with Gu Tian and Hua Zhiru’s support. He limped over to Lu Lu, then patted her shoulders and shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you alright?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Lu’s words were of a completely caring tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled, then shook his head before wiping away the blood from the corner of his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, he brushed off the support of the people beside him, then walked towards the man a step at a time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man smiled towards Ye Zichen, who was walking towards him, as if he didn’t take the threat of Lu Lu seriously at all, “It seems like you have a lot to say to me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Indeed, I had a lot to say to you before this,” Ye Zichen stopped ten centimeters away from the man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were of a similar height, and had a similar appearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Ye Zichen felt like he was looking into a mirror.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then don’t you have anything you want to say now? My good son, you truly hurt dad’s heart,” the man squinted his eyes and mocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sad? My mom should be even more sad in comparison, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Her?” the man suddenly laughed. “Even if she is sad, it shouldn’t be because of me. Her sadness should be directed towards the family she was in. It was the Gu family that pushed her to me in exchange of a hundred years of stability. That’s all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe…” Ye Zichen smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I told you, I really hate your expression,” the man’s gaze suddenly turned dark. “You are furious and want to take revenge for your mother? My good son, you’re still too weak. Even if you want to take revenge, you should go and find your grandfather. If you don’t believe me, then go back and ask Gu Rong who is the person she hates most!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that so?” Ye Zichen smiled, while his gaze also turned sullen. “I don’t know who I’m supposed to blame. Nor do I want to open up mother’s past wounds. All I know is that… Right now, the person I hate most is you. That is enough!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clenched his fist while his hands glittered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He swung his fist at the man’s face. Since the two of them stood too close to one another, the man was unable to evade in time, and had to take the brunt of Ye Zichen’s punch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s shoulders trembled after swinging the first.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His heart was already filled with an indescribable anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He doesn’t know about the past, but from the words that the man had said, and the man’s anger-inducing looks…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen could be sure that, he… let Ye Rong down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My good son, you’re not obedient at all. It is always the father beating the son, since when was the son allowed to hit the father?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man frowned. He swiped his finger over the corner of his mouth, then, while he saw the redness on his fingers…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And I’m bleeding. This truly is outrageous!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, a suffocating aura of spiritual energy radiated out from the man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then let me act out my duty as the father!”</span></p>
