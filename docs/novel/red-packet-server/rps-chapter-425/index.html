 <p><span style>Chapter 425 – Riot in the Red Packet Server</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The capital’s Xiao family.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had done his research during the short period of time that he was in the capital, and that naturally included information on the Xiao family.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were one of the top families in the capital. They have been businessmen for generation, and they were a family specializing in the business industry, while maintaining quite a bit of power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was not too surprised when he heard that Xiao Yumei was actually someone from the Xiao family.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During their relationship, she had more than once hinted at the fact that her identity was not simple. Now that he heard her tell him that she was someone from the Xiao family, the most it did was to merely prove the suspicions he already had.</span></p>
 <p><span style> “The Xiao family is one of those very old fashioned families. I was exiled since I was rather rebellious when I was young, and the fact that my father did not really have any true status in the family,” Xiao Yumei smiled sadly as she told her story. Actually, she had already spoken as simply as possible, if she were to go into the actual details…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The full story wasn’t that simple.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then that is truly the Xiao family’s loss. With your business talent, I feel like you could definitely bring the Xiao family to a new height. I remember hearing that the Xiao family has already fallen from grace,” Ye Zichen smiled. Xiao Yumei did not retort, and merely nodded in response to Ye Zichen’s words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, my cousin came just now to tell me to return.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And the price?” Ye Zichen could tell from that grandson’s shitty appearance that he wasn’t a good person. He was definitely going to make Xiao Yumei pay a huge price for returning to the family.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He told me to give him the company,” Xiao Yumei smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, he raised his eyebrows, “He isn’t really strong, but does have a huge appetite… Seriously, what do you think?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I definitely will not give him the company, and I won’t explain the details. However, I actually do want to return to the Xiao family quite a bit,” Xiao Yumei bit her lips as she replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was not surprised by her reply at all. She was different from him. The reason he didn’t want to return to the Gu family after finding out about his background was because he had never once lived in the Gu household.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Xiao Yumei was different. She lived in the Xiao family since a young age, so she did hold feelings for the Xiao family.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So, it was natural for her to want to return.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then you don’t want to give up the company? And want to return to the Xiao family? What are you planning?” Ye Zichen asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei shook her head, “No, let’s take it as it comes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm, don’t tire yourself too much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen held Xiao Yumei’s hand tightly, then felt the phone in his pocket vibrate continuously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He took out his phone, and saw that someone was continuously mentioning him in a chat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He opened WeChat, and saw that the group chat continuously mentioning him was the Red Packet Server he created. All of the people in the group were people that he was rather close with.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He scrolled through the chat history…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Why do I feel like the thingy Old Lord Taishang presented was very familiar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: Indeed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: Monkey Bro, Yang Jian, when could have the two of you seen it? Why haven’t I, Old Pig, never seen something like that? Old Lord Taishang said that it was called… Silk Stockings? @Yue Lao, have you seen it before?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: This old man hasn’t seen it before either, but I checked out the material used to make the Silk Stockings. It’s too terrible!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: Old Lord Taishang actually didn’t give pills this time, so Old Pig found it rather strange. But… it seemed like the Queen Mother liked the silk stockings a lot. It looks like Old Pig isn’t going to get a chance at the ten thousand year immortality peaches this time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: Idiot, what are you worrying for? Isn’t big bro here?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: Oh, dear older brother, little brother’s happiness is all on you.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: I hope Great Sage can help this old man steal one as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: No problem!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: You guys are getting off topic. Weren’t we talking about the black stockings? @Monkey King, you’ve been over there as well, do you feel like the black silk stockings…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: @Only Idealism!</span></p>
 <p><span style>And thus, Yang Jian and the monkey continuously mentioned Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen could tell from their chat that Old Lord Taishang had given the black silk stockings to the Queen Mother, and she had liked it very much. That was the only reason why the group was talking about it.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Stubborn old man, you were actually getting worried.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen cursed silently, but Yang Jian and the monkey’s continuous mention of him in the group did make him slightly speechless…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, I’m here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Bro, you’re being unfair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: Yeah. You clearly know that I, Old Sun, isn’t on good terms with that old man, and you actually helped him!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: What’s going on?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: Doesn’t get it +1.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Fortune: Doesn’t get it +10086.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: You guys probably don’t know. My bro gave Old Lord Taishang that pair of black silk stockings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: No wonder. Outside of Sky Sovereign, I can’t imagine anyone getting this sort of rare treasure. @Only Idealism, Sky Sovereign, you selling black silk stockings in large amounts? I feel like this thing can get really popular in the Heavenly Court!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: @Yue Lao, yep, I’ll send you a price list later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: Sure!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: @Only Idealism, don’t change the topic. Bro, we’re sworn brothers, you clearly know the Immortality Peach Feast is starting, and you actually didn’t give that treasure to me?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You didn’t come to me!” Ye Zichen explained helplessly. “I only sent him a pair of black silk stockings since I did have something to ask Old Lord Taishang for. Don’t worry… Did the Immortality Peach Feast end yet? If it didn’t, then I’ll send you guys some treasures, alright?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: It hasn’t ended yet, it’s not Old Pig’s turn yet. Sky Sovereign hurry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: I didn’t go up yet either. Bro… Good bro!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: I, Old Sun, didn’t go up yet either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: Ai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Fortunate: Ai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the sighs, it was clear that the two have already gave their present. </span><i><span style>So, only the three of them left in the group. </span></i><span style>Ye Zichen squinted his eyes. </span><i><span style>Since the Queen Mother accepted the black silk stockings…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He smiled faintly. </span><i><span style>Since we’re messing around… Then, we’ll do something more fun.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You guys, go and see how large the Queen Mother’s feet are, and what’s her bra size. Tell me afterwards.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“37, B+!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Ye Zichen asked, Yang Jian immediately replied on the screen. After which, Yang Jian intentionally added another message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t think about it too much. Oh yeah, bro, hurry up. It’s our turn very soon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>There’s no three hundred taels of silver buried here!<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian had learnt how to tell such things from Ye Zichen during the period of time that he descended. He was able to see everything about a woman in front of him with one gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, wait a moment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen set his gaze onto Xiao Yumei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you looking at me for? I have size 36 feet, and my bra size is C+. Even if I take them off, the Queen Mother can’t put them on,” Xiao Yumei said helplessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shook his head with a smile, “I’m not asking you for it. We… Isn’t there an entire company here?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I really can’t imagine, if the Queen Mother puts on high heels, black silk stockings, and kinky underwear… Ahem, wouldn’t the Queen Mother’s husband die of bedroom happiness?</span></i></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Original Chapter Teaser:</b>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p><b>God of Fortune:&nbsp;</b>@Old Lord Taishang. Congratulations!</p>
 <p><strong>Yue Lao:&nbsp;</strong>@Old Lord Taishang, Congratulations!</p>
 <p><strong>Erlang Shen:&nbsp;</strong>Tsk. @Only Idealism, I'm going to have to get an explanation!</p>
 <p><strong>Monkey King:&nbsp;</strong>@Only Idealism, yeah, give me an explanation!</p>
 <p><strong>Canopy Marshal:&nbsp;</strong>I don't know why you're pinging him, but @Only Idealism, I need an explanation!</p>
 <p><strong>God of Fortune:&nbsp;</strong>Hmm? Why are you guys all pinging him?</p>
 <p><strong>Erlang Shen:&nbsp;</strong>Isn't it obvious? That thing that Old Lord Taishang presented to the Queen Mother was definitely from my bro!</p>
 <p><strong>Yue Lao:&nbsp;</strong>I see! No wonder it was so unique and didn't seem like anything related to pills. @Only Idealism, that silk stockings or something seems like something very well worth investing in! We can definitely make a lot of money out of it.</p>
