 <p><span style>Chapter 260 – Obligatory Education Plans for the Heavenly Court</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled wryly in response to the questioning tone that left no space for negotiations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He raised his eyebrows at the veiled lady and shook his head, “I have to pick out all of the stones that will give out jade for you? Do I owe you anything?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mr. Ye isn’t going to agree?” The veiled lady raised her eyebrows. “Isn’t it fine if you just treat it as compensating me for my previous losses?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe…” Ye Zichen liked his lips. “Fine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen did not say a single word to the woman after picking out all of the stones with jades in them, then he left the trade center with Bai Dahai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The veiled lady nodded meaningfully with her hands beneath her chin, and pointed at the stones Ye Zichen picked out, “Open them, open them all right here! I have to know just what’s so amazing about this guy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now that he had a large supply of ores, Bai Dahai promised Ye Zichen with certainty that he’d definitely double the jewelry shops’ profits.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen did not care about it all that much, since he did not have much desire when it came to money…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, he was a bit annoyed by the veiled lady for ordering him around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen frowned, then dialed Xiao Hai’s number.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, how did you find so much spare time to call Hai-ge?” Xiao Hai laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Actually, I do have business to bother Hai-ge with. I want Hai-ge to help me investigate into a person’s background,” Ye Zichen squinted his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh? Say, who is it?” Xiao Hai spoke with a bit of confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The person in charge of the ore trade center, a woman wearing a veil!” Ye Zichen replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem!” Xiao Hai replied without any hesitation. “Find some time to play with Hai-ge, we haven’t met for a long time, let’s get a drink together!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, I’ll definitely go and bother Hai-ge when I have time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen hung up the call with a smile, then habitually looked at the Heavenly Court’s chat group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone was sighing in the group, including a deity that he never saw in the group before.</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>Earthen Lord<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>!</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>Earthen Lord: Great deities, help me think of something, otherwise, this old one’s beard is going to get completely pulled out by those kids.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: This is rather difficult!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mother of Lightning: Yeah, those kids are all heavenly third generations of great deities, we can’t do anything about them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: Aren’t there plenty of great deities here? Perhaps Grandpa Earthen Lord can go directly to the parent?</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Immortality Peach Fairy, that isn’t going to work. All of these children are the treasures of their families. Even if Earthen goes to the parent, those kids wouldn’t get punished one bit, the person who’s going to suffer is still going to be Earthen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earthen Lord: Exactly!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen read the chat for awhile, then replied in the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on? Is there some sort of trouble that can’t be dealt with?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Hey, Sky Sovereign is here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: @Earthen Lord, tell Sky Sovereign about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earthen Lord: Greetings, Sky Sovereign.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sky Sovereign was a title used by extremely high ranked people, it outranked even titles such as True Lord and Dao Lord.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earthen Lord was a mere deity, it was impossible for him not to be frightened when meeting this sort of great deity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm, no need for such courtesy, Earthen Lord. What were you all saying just now…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earthen Lord, who was sitting on the ground, snuck a peek at the celestial children running around his vegetable garden.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign might not know, this puny deity resides in a place outside of the Heavenly Court. Celestials live forever. Although the Heavenly Court once had a birth control plan in place, there were still plenty of celestial children born. It was fine before, since I could handle ten-odd children, but now…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earthen Lord sighed, then continued.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Recently, there have been more and more celestial children, and they are extremely active. These old bones really can’t handle their torture. However… this puny deity is low-ranked, and doesn’t dare to get mad at these celestial children, nor can I go and seek out their parents!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded, the issue just laid with children’s hyperactive period. Since their parents were busy with work, they were unable to take care of them. There were no nurseries or kindergartens over there either, so it seemed like Earthen Lord couldn’t seem to take it anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This issue can be easily dealt with.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, please solve this little deity’s troubles.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earthen Lord and the other deities in the group were all shocked. This issue had been troublesome for the Heavenly Court for a long time, but they have never seen anyone being able to deal with it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We have to go and talk to our Heavenly Court’s butler, Great Deity Taibai. @Taibai Jinxing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing: What is it!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It seems like this old brat is keeping an eye on the group. He immediately popped up after being mentioned.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Scroll up and look at what Earthen Lord said!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have read all that. This problem has always been one of the major issues in the Heavenly Court. You said that you can solve it?” Taibai Jinxing raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t this problem super simple?” Ye Zichen smiled. “Established a school!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How exactly?” Taibai Jinxing asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Split the school into kindergarten, primary, middle school and high school divisions. Then, placed the celestial children of the appropriate age groups into the corresponding schools and manage them together. This way, not only can you deal with the problem of the celestial children running around, you can develop their celestial spiritual energy from a young age, allowing them to win at the finish line!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Amazing, Sky Sovereign’s solution is truly amazing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder and the other deities all applauded, while Taibai Jinxing raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why did I never think of this solution before?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“But… Someone still needs to manage the school if it is established, right? Then, who is going to be the ones to manage these celestial children?” Immortality Peach Fairy blinked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The school will naturally have teachers, and these teachers definitely have to be able to control these children. That’s why, you can choose from those celestial second generations. These celestial second generations are mostly deities with nothing to do. Getting them to teach at the school is kind of finding work for them as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s more, the school needs to have a principle and a registrar. These positions can be filled by great reputed deities that are not very busy normally. This will form a hierarchy where one levels manages the next!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing slapped his thighs when he saw Ye Zichen’s thoughts.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Amazing!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Since those celestial second generations have nothing better to do, and they organize gang fights or steals random stuff when they are bored; this not only deals with the problem of no one managing the celestial children in the Heavenly Court, it even deals with the problem of those second generation deities.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll report it to the Jade Emperor right now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Taibai Jinxing sent that message, Ye Zichen saw Taibai Jinxing sent him a red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received Taibai Jinxing’s red packet, cultivation experience x200000.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Laddie, you are promising. Not bad! You essentially dealt with a huge trouble for the Heavenly Court. I will ask the Jade Emperor right now, if it passes, then there’ll be benefits for you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your intimacy level with Taibai Jinxing increased by 200. Current intimacy level: 400.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled faintly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earthen Lord has sent you a friend request.</span></p>

 <p style="text-align: center;">It was just another day,</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;">With trouble brewed and kids astray.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;">Little could poor Earthen do,</p>

 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;">When rich brats pulled on beards that grew.</p>

 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;">Avoiding them he tried and did,</p>
