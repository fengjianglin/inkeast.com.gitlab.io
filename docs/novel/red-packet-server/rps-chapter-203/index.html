 <p><span style>Chapter 203 – Gu Tian’s Deal</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Young Master Ye?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Cui Xuan, who was at the side, was completely shocked. </span><i><span style>This young master in front of me is famous in Bingcheng.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>His family’s business is also top class. Even if my father saw this young master, he would have to act respectfully.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But he actually called Ye Zichen, Young Master Ye!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, Cui Xuan felt as if his brain had short-circuited.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed like his old classmate wasn’t just simply doing good.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qu Yaoyang…” Ye Zichen smiled wryly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qu Yaoyang quickly nodded, “Young Master Ye, I’m here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have a seat,” Ye Zichen pointed at the sofa in the room, then led Mu Jinglei over.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I didn’t think that I would bump into this great lord here.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Qu Yaoyang felt beyond awkward. Ignoring the fact that he had been beaten, he wasn’t in a position to get back at Ye Zichen either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The meeting between the two was as awkward as it could possibly get.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the most awkward person present was definitely Cui Xuan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In his mind, Young Master Qu was a very important person. From the looks of things, Ye Zichen seemed to be a very important person in the minds of the person he regarded as a very important person...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why aren’t you speaking!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sat on the sofa and crossed his legs, while both Qu Yaoyang and Cui Xuan forced a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen glanced at his ex-classmate, who was on the side, and said softly, “Qu Yaoyang, let me introduce you. This is my old classmate, Cui Xuan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve heard a lot about you,” Qu Yaoyang quickly stood up from the sofa, while Cui Xuan also did the same to shake hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I heard that you two have some sort of cooperation going on… Hmmm, take good care of my old classmate in the future!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem, a friend of Young Master Ye is a friend of mine,” With that, Qu Yaoyang patted Cui Xuan’s shoulders. “Cui Xuan, about financing your company, just directly come to see me with the contract.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“About this…” Cui Xuan was shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had troubled himself a lot for this financing matter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He never would have thought that just because of a single one of Ye Zichen’s sentence that it was passed through!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you Young Master Qu, thank you Young Master Ye. Continue chatting here, I’ll be leaving first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Cui Xuan wasn’t someone that couldn’t read the mood, he understood that he was just in the way after finishing the talk about the contract.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, Cui Yang left the room with an apologetic smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Qu Yaoyang also smiled coyly, “Young Master Ye.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm, it seems like you recovered pretty well, I can’t tell that you were ever wounded,” Ye Zichen nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Qu Yaoyang’s expression froze as he maintained his smile, “Young Master Ye, last time, this little brother had eyes, but no pupils, I hope Young Master Ye does not take it to heart.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won’t, don’t be nervous, I’m not the type to hold a grudge.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you for Young Master Ye being magnanimous,” Qu Yaoyang smiled coyly. When he saw Ye Zichen’s impatient expression, he immediately spoke up. “Young Master Ye, I’ll leave this room to you. I won’t disturb your world of two.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t want to stay to have a bite?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need, no need!” Qu Yaoyang waved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>How would he dared to stay?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fine, then go. When you go out, tell the manager to take the dishes over here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Ye Zichen sent Qu Yaoyang away, Mu Jinglei, who was sitting beside him, spoke up in confusion, “Zichen, we haven’t met for a bit more than a month, but you changed so much that sis doesn’t really know you anymore!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows and smiled, “How is that possible? Aren’t I the same as before?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Jinglei shook her head and said with a hint of confusion in her eyes, “When I went out for business, I saw your header on Weibo. I’ve also heard about a talent agency taking you on board. When you told me that you earned a bit of money, I thought you signed with a talent agency, but from the looks of it, it isn’t as simple as I thought!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The meal continued slightly awkwardly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the meal, Mu Jinglei’s questions continuously flew towards Ye Zichen like bullets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her title of the Kind Killer was not just for show. Although her questions seemed normal, but each one was deadly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen felt like his head was going to explode just from answering the questions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they left the restaurant, Mu Jinglei squinted her eyes and smiled meaningfully, “Our Zichen grew up…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sis, you are really making me feel troubled,” Ye Zichen smiled wryly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Jinglei giggled and stopped a taxi, “Didn’t you say you have stuff to busy yourself with? Then go, but the lessons tomorrow…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll definitely be there!” Ye Zichen quickly stood straight and saluted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry, sis isn’t such a not understanding person. Since you’ve achieved so much, it doesn’t matter if you go to lessons or not.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sis, I’ll definitely be there!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sis is very happy when I see that little brother loves studying so much. Remember to come to class tomorrow!” With that, Mu Jinglei opened the taxi door and left the restaurant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did Ye Zichen let out a long sigh…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Women are truly creatures that are hard to understand.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the phone in his pocket rang annoyingly once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but frown and take out his phone when he heard his phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry, hurry, hurry for what! I was eating just now, would I keep owing you a toy!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>While he was eating, Xie Lei kept on hurrying him to send the toys over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he wasn’t Xie Bian’s grandson, Ye Zichen would’ve just ignored him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can I interpret this as you getting angry with me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>XIe Lei pretty much replied instantly, while his unfriendly tone caused Ye Zichen to roll his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Cocky for what.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>When my Immortal Heart of Pure Yang is of a high level and I’ve become an Immortal King, even your grandpa’s going to be of no use.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, he wasn’t able to match this brat at this moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, I just didn’t want you to be anxious. This lowly one will go and buy the toys now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then hurry up. Oh yeah, buy a puzzle as well. Bu Er said that he wants to play.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I’ll endure it.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It doesn’t cost much anyways, so I’ll just buy it.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen replied Xie Lei bitterly, then stopped a taxi to go to the toy store.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, before he got on, Ye Zichen realized that he should buy a car.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ever since the 918 Xiao Hai gave him was trashed, he never had another car.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I’ll buy one for myself when I have time. No matter what, it is still more convenient.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen got to the toy store, he bought the Transformers and puzzle, then sent it to Xie Lei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He thought he could earn a bit of intimacy level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>There wasn’t even a word of thanks, not to mention intimacy level.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It was still Cold at 0.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Clap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Ye Zichen was looking at his phone screen and retorting about how sissy Xie Lei was, he felt someone suddenly pat him on the shoulders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He shuddered, put away the phone and turned around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a face with a bright smile, but what awaited the face was Ye Zichen’s fist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Tian felt really dizzy by Ye Zichen’s punch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a long while, he finally muttered in an extremely troubled tone, “Why did you hit me again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My hands itch whenever I see you,” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes. Then he took out a cigarette from his pocket and lit it for himself. “Say it, what did you seek me out for this time!? Don’t tell me it was a coincidence, we really don’t have such fate!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to discuss with Brother Zichen about a deal!” Gu Tian smiled, and took out a piece of ancient wood. “This… is the pay!”</span></p>
