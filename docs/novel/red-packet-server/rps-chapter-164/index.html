 <p><span style>Chapter 164 – Gifting a phone is only the first step</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen ran over to a phone shop to buy a smartphone, then sent it over to Han Xiangzi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lü Dongbin received your red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within the Eight Immortal Manor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Xiangzi’s hands trembled when he looked at the phone Ye Zichen had sent over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The phone was a lot prettier than the ones they could buy in the Heavenly Court. What’s more, this great deity actually bought him a phone…</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was advanced technology that they, the Eight Immortals, could only buy after using up all their savings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Celestial sovereign, I really don’t know…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Xiangzi was so excited that he was unable to say anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pursed his lips and smiled, “Try to see if you can use it first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He did send the phone over, but he didn’t know if the technology over at the Heavenly Court was the same or not.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was another business opportunity if he could make use of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he couldn’t, then it’s all pointless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen prompted Han Xiangzi to familiarize himself with the phone, then put his own phone back in his pocket. Only then did he see Xia Keke tilting her head as he looked at him with her bright eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You were chatting with Han Xiangzi?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah,” Ye Zichen nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason he did everything openly around Xia Keke was actually because he didn’t want to lie to them anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everything will be known sooner or later, he might as well reveal it earlier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So that he didn’t have to get so worried every single day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had already thought up of a series of explanations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However Xia Keke merely blinked, “Oh!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Oh.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Oh.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Oh!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>She only said ‘Oh!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Aren’t you curious?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What should I be curious about?” Xia Keke stared at him. “I believe in the Great Sage’s existence, so I naturally believe in Han Xiangzi’s existence. Since the Great Sage could come here to play with you, what’s so surprising about you WeChatting Han Xiangzi!?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Damn!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but to touch Xia Keke on her forehead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you think you are doing!” Xia Keke pouted unhappily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did I forget to take pills today, or did I wake up too suddenly? You seriously don’t find it weird?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nope,” Xia Keke’s reply was extremely simple, causing Ye Zichen to be stunned for a long time as he stood on the spot…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wow, this girl really isn’t a normal person!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your intimacy level with Han Xiangzi increased by 50. Current intimacy level: 300.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment the news came out, Han Xiangzi’s profile pic lit up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Xiangzi: Great deity, I can use the phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Snap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen snapped his fingers.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The phones from this side could actually be used in the Heavenly Court and he was able to feel from Han Xiangzi’s words that the phones in the Heavenly Court were outrageously expensive…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But they weren’t expensive over here!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>High-end ones, middle-class ones, cheap ones!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It was all up to you!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s good that you can use it. Just advertise it in the Heavenly Court circles for me in the future. I’m selling phones here, the stuff’s good and it’s cheap. Contact me if anyone needs one.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I want to buy a phone that’s exactly the same for Immortal Lady He….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Ye Zichen sent the phone over, Immortal Lady He already started saying that she wanted one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Xiangzi truly wished Immortal Lady He asked him for a present, thus he made up his mind that regardless how expensive Ye Zichen’s price was, he was going to buy the phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Two hundred thousand cultivation experience.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Evil!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was truly travelling far on the path of becoming an evil merchant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was selling a two thousand yuan phone for two hundred thousand cultivation experience. He essentially multiplied the price a hundred times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He only multiplied it by ten times when he was selling snacks.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Cultivation experience!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen felt that he was rather evil, but Han Xiangzi didn’t think so…</span></p>
 <p><span style>For immortals like them who gained their own dao, the thing they lacked least was cultivation experience. It could be said that cultivation experience barely even mattered to them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Xiangzi directly sent some cultivation experience over without saying anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received Han Xiangzi’s red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cultivation experience x400000.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Xiangzi: Does great deity want cultivation experience to increase the celestial position? Immortals like us, the Eight Immortals, don’t really need cultivation experience, just treat the past phone as something I bought from you.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Good brat.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>He knows how to be an Immortal!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The fact that Han Xiangzi sent several hundred thousand cultivation experience over made it seem that the people in the Heavenly Court truly didn’t treat cultivation experience as a big deal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but exclaim that selling phones was truly a good job.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had to tire himself out so much while selling snacks in order to earn several hundred thousand cultivation experience. When it came to phones, he got four hundred thousand cultivation experience with just 2.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen ran back to the phone store and bought another smart phone that was the same as the one he bought before and sent it over to Han Xiangzi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After ten odd minutes, Han Xiangzi finally appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great deity, I wonder how can I improve my relationship with Immortal Lady He?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did your relationship not improve just now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled playfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won’t hide it from great deity, Immortal Lady He’s feelings did start to change towards me just now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, that’s right,” Ye Zichen lectured him like an experienced person. “Gifting a phone was just the first step, but I have a way that could let your feelings for each other develop quickly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great deity, please tell me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Xiangzi’s expression tensed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait a moment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment he sent the message, Ye Zichen put his phone into his pocket and dragged Xia Keke along, who was completely stunned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ve finished chatting?” Xia Keke asked, showing her confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rubbed her head, “Not yet, but we have to go and do something important.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just come with me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stopped a taxi, then went to a nearby jewelry store.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What did women like most!?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Of course, it’s shiny diamond rings!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>If Han Xiangzi could give Immortal Lady He a diamond ring, Ye Zichen was sure that it would have critical effects.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It might even directly set their relationship for life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, what did you bring me here for?” Xia Keke blushed. She knew very well what sort of place this was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke’s heart beat rapidly as she swept her gaze across Ye Zichen’s body with her beautiful eyes.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could he be going to buy a diamond ring for me?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Important business.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh,” Xia Keke nodded obediently, then just let Ye Zichen hold her hand and walk over to the jewelry store counter, while her heart raced like a deer through the forest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir, do you want to buy a ring?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m just looking around.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The clerk nodded understandingly. The people that came here would often just look around, but since they came here, it meant that there was a need for them to buy it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for whether or not the shop could sell anything, it was up to them, the clerks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Take this, this, this and this out for me to have a look.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen chose several diamond rings, whose prices were all above three hundred thousand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The clerk paused for a moment. She had worked in the store for a long time, but she had never seen anyone choose a ring like that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, since the customer wanted it, they naturally had to satisfy the customer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since he dared to look at rings like that, he just might place a huge order.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as the clerk was about to take out the rings, an unusually seductively dressed woman walked out from behind Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Li, how many times have I told you? Before taking the rings out, you have to see whether they have the ability to buy it… They look like this, it’s obvious that they’re poor students, isn’t taking them out pointless?”</span></p>
