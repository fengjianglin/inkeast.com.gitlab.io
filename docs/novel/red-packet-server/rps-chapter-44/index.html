 <p><span style>Chapter 44 – Linking</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen zoned out as he sat on the chair of the mansion, while holding his phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as if Monkey Bro had disappeared from the Heavenly Court. He no longer flamed Erlang Shen in the group, nor did he brag with Ye Zichen on WeChat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at their last chat history.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The last message was from several days ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great Sage, where did you go to have fun? I haven’t seen you around.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was still no reply after a long time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Rong put the washed grapes on the stone table in the courtyard, while Lil’ White followed behind her proudly as it wagged its tail.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It’s tsundere-look caused people to be unable to resist her at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, eat some grapes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Ye Zichen put away his phone, took out a grape and chucked it into his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ White sat beside his feet and looked towards the palte.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As if saying: Give me one as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen casually chucked a few grapes from the plate. Lil’ White leaped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom, zoom, zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The three grapes directly entered Lil’ White’s mouth without touching the floor at all.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Oh wow, pretty good.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen grabbed another handful and chucked them at Lil’ White.</span></p>
 <p><span style>None of them fell on the floor either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ White wagged its tail in disdain, then left proudly with its head held high.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This little thing…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen laughed, while Ye Rong also smiled when she looked at Lil’ White.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ White is very smart, it’s like it can understand what we’re saying.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, didn’t you see who chose it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>What Ye Zichen actually wanted to say was ‘Of course, how could a dog from the Heavenly Court be bad’?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After eating grapes for a bit, Ye Rong spoke up after a brief hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows and sat straight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Although I have Lil’ White accompanying me, mom still feels a bit bored while staying alone at the mansion every day.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen could understand as well. There was hardly anyone in the mansion area.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Rong couldn’t even find anyone to chat with. Furthermore, she also did a bit of sales back in the village, she would naturally be a bit frantic since she suddenly quietened down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, there were a lot of jobs, but it would depend on what it was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen can’t exactly tell his mother to continue selling fruits, he didn’t want to see his mother get tired.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you want to do? Furthermore, we have to have a startup fund if we want to do some sort of business, your son is completely poor right now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen wanted to listen to Ye Rong’s thoughts. Furthermore, him saying “completely poor” was not a lie, he still owed people money.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although he didn’t need to return it, he still felt like it was owing money.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Rong took out a card and put it onto the table. Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This card...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is the demolition fee for owe home. I don’t know why they gave two million!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since they gave it, then we’ll keep it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no doubt that the extra money was from that grandson, Huang Ming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right now, that grandson would be completely terrified when he sees him, just like a mouse seeing a cat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He might have scared him to the point that he pissed himself back at the village. Truth be told, Ye Zichen didn’t know why this grandson was that afraid of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then maybe we should do something with the money on the card?” Ye Rong asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was truly troubled by this question. He had never started a business before, the money in his hands was like ill-gotten wealth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just keep the money with you for now. I’ll go and ask my friends to see what is suitable for you to do.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s fine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Rong smiled, and put away the card.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh yeah, son, don’t university students date? Why have I never seen you bring anyone back?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen could only run away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, I didn’t think that your family was rather rich, you can stay in such a high class mansion.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing smiled playfully at Ye Zichen when he got in the car.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled coyly and rubbed Liu Qing’s head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I told you, you’ll definitely have a good time if you follow me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tsk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing snorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she felt a certain feeling in her heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One cause of it was the head rubbing just now, her head haven’t been rubbed in such a long time. Ye Zichen was the first one that could touch her after she became a ghost.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Grandpa Gu could not do it before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, her confidence in Ye Zichen increased by a large amount.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Ye Zichen was driving, he suddenly saw an old man running sneakily down the side of the road.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Isn’t that Su Yan’s grandpa?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed like he had escaped successfully once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Beep beep.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pressed the car horn twice. When Old Man Su saw Ye Zichen, his eyes brightened, then ran over and directly sat in the front passenger seat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Ye, hurry. Start driving.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aiyo, he’s squishing me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing was sitting in the front passenger seat just now, so when Old Man Su got on the car, he had directly sat on top of her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen snickered, causing Liu Qing to curse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re still laughing, hurry up and make the old man get up for a moment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen held back his laughter. Meanwhile, Old Man Su got a bit anxious when he saw that Ye Zichen still didn’t start driving.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Ye, what are you doing! Hurry up and drive. They’ll catch up soon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, alright. But, Old Man Su, can you lift your butt for a moment?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nearly laughed out loud when he said this. Old Man Su was also a bit confused by this, but he still chose to lift his but.</span></p>
 <p><span style> “I’m finally free.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing sighed, the floated onto the back seat. Ye Zichen also held back his laughter and asked Old Man Su.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where to?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Doesn’t matter, anywhere that I can drink is fine!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen slammed down on the pedal, causing his car to disappear from the road like a bolt of lightning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long after he left, a group of men in military clothing appeared in the spot they were on just now. He watched as Ye Zichen’s car sped away and shouted into the walkie-talkie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I couldn’t catch up to Chief. He got onto a car with the plate number XXXXXX. Requesting aid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen chose to park near a barbeque store.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He still remembered that Old Man Su likes this. What’s more, people his age shouldn’t like places like a bar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After ordering a bunch of barbeques, Ye Zichen and Elder Su started to directly drink from beer bottles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Ye, such is fate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen chuckled, it really was fate, he had met Elder Su both times Elder Su escaped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Man Su, you are looking better and better.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen put the beer to the side, and took a bite off a lamb skewer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Ye, I feel like it’s all thanks to your wine,” Old Man Su took a bit off a skewer and said. “I would secretly take a few sips of the wine you gave me every day. Every time I drink it, I feel a bit better, and my body seems to get better as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, it might be because Old Man Su satisfied his alcohol thirst, and got into a good mood.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s true.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Man Su chuckled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a few rounds, Old Man Su and Ye Zichen’s topic gradually changed to Su Yan from being about alcohol.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Ye, have you contacted my granddaughter recently?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t talk about it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shook his head and sighed. They did have some sort of relationship before, but the f*cking string snapped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had been feeling troubled about the broken string.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? My granddaughter didn’t get interested in you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, and no,” Ye Zichen didn’t know how to reply. However, Old Man Su chucked, “Do you need this old man to help link the two of you again?”</span></p>
