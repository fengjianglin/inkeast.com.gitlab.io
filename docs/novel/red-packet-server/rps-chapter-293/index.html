 <p><span style>Chapter 293 – Terrifying Woman.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This is the exact scene.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Li Shuang giggled at the side as she looked at Gu Lüdan, who was completely dumbfounded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you blanking out for? Thank Chairman Ye.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This girl is just like me back then…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Can I seriously?” Gu Lüdan pinched her own arm with a lot of force, as if she had not calmed down from the shock yet…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ouch.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but chuckle when she saw the girl’s slightly idiotic look, “Everything is real. Alright, you are a supervisor of the administration department from now on. The administration department is the face of Maintaining Beauty, so you have to make sure that everything is alright!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem!” Gu Lüdan answered confidently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Later, within the elevator…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stood within the elevator with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Shuang’s heart leaped when she saw his smile, “Boss, are you thinking about that girl?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A pretty cute kid,” Ye Zichen replied like an old man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t seem to be older than that staff member,” Li Shuang chuckled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But my heart is old,” Ye Zichen shrugged helplessly with a smile. After so many things have happened to him, it would truly be unnatural if his heart did not age.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen let out a sigh, then glanced at Li Shuang, “What did you just go to do? It looks like you just came back?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mu Chuang had several things that he didn’t understand in the jewelry store. Since Director Bai wasn’t there, I went over to help!” Li Shuang smiled in response.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How is Mu Chuang doing there?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen did care quite a bit for this little brother of his. Although they weren’t real brothers, they did grow up together on great terms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s very focused.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Li Chuang, what do you think about Mu Chuang as a person?” Ye Zichen suddenly asked. However, before Li Shuang replied, he quickly spoke up again. “Never mind, pretend like I didn’t say anything.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, what did you actually want to ask?” Li Shuang couldn’t help but ask.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aii, I was just wondering whether you two might get together, and I could help pair the two of you or something. But then again, it seems like there is a kind of large difference in your ages… Never mind, pretend like I didn’t say anything!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the lift door opened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen quickly walked out of the elevator, leaving Li Shuang alone within to gaze at his back with a sad smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen directly rushed to Xiao Yumei’s office. When he got to it, he took a sniff of the flower’s fragrance, smile, then directly pushed the door open without knocking…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“SURPRISE!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had wanted to surprise Xiao Yumei, but the moment he entered…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He noticed that a business negotiation seemed to be going on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“… Do continue,” Ye Zichen smiled awkwardly as he closed the door with flowers in his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, a hand reached over to pull the office door, “Since Mr. Ye came, then let’s discuss this together, this corporation does belong to you.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This familiar tone…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was truly speechless. The person in front of him who spoke up was the woman that screwed him over in the ore trade center.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’re talking business! Since I’m a businesswoman, I will join in wherever there is profits to be made!” The veiled lady spoke with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since it was her, Ye Zichen did not mind at all and directly walked over to Xiao Yumei with the flowers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yumei, these are for you,” Ye Zichen handed the flowers in his hand over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Xiao Yumei saw the flowers, a smile bloomed on her face, “Thank you, I like them a lot.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I never expected Mr. Ye to be a romantic person as well. Director Xiao, I’m so envious!” The veiled lady sat on the office’s sofa while hugging her shoulders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but get annoyed when he looked at her, “If you’re that jealous, then find a man to send some to you. What are you getting envious here for!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? You wear a veil all the time, are you afraid of being seen? Back then, I didn’t dare to offend you since it was on your turf! It is my turf now, so can’t I act more to my liking?” Ye Zichen glared. “Yumei, what sort of cooperation did she come to discuss about?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She wants to be an agent for our company!” Xiao Yumei replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t let her!” Ye Zichen glared at the veiled lady as he said that. It was as if he was saying ‘I’m going to piss you off’, ‘I’m going to piss you off’…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The veiled lady merely smiled, then brought over a contract from the side with a shrug, “It’s been signed already.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was completely speechless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen picked up the contract from the table and took a glance…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qu Qitong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, he took a look at the actual body of the contract.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Twenty percent? It can’t be, a businesswoman like you only wants twenty percent of the profits?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Twenty percent is already quite a bit,” Qu Qitong smiled faintly. “Director Xiao is a smart businesswoman as well. When smart people cooperate, both sides naturally have to show some goodwill.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei nodded in response, then looked at Qu Qitong, “Director Qu, actually, I’ve always had a question I wanted to ask you about. Just what exactly gave you so much faith in our product?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You really want to know? Qu Qitong smiled, then took off her veil.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both Ye Zichen and Xiao Yumei were completely shocked when they saw her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An originally beautiful face was completely ruined like she had been in a car accident. The dense scars crawled along her face, which would be described as menacing without any exaggeration.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both Ye Zichen and Xiao Yumei apologized together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qu Qitong merely smiled, then put the veil back on, “There is nothing to apologize about. It should actually be me who thanked you guys.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It was this product of yours that filled my future with hope. You might not be able to imagine it, but actually, the scars on my face were much more severe three days ago,” Qu Qitong smiled faintly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, both Ye Zichen and Xiao Yumei were completely stunned.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Even more severe, just what was it like before?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, Ye Zichen actually felt a hint of pity for the girl. </span><i><span style>Just what did she go through to get her face ruined like this?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t need your pity,” Qu Qitong’s voice suddenly turned cold. “I did not get to this stage through others pity.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Can this girl read minds?</span></i><span style> Ye Zichen frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can’t read minds,” Qu Qitong spoke up once more. “I’m just a businesswoman. Observing expressions is just a basic survival skill.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen has no need to feel speechless,” Qu Qitong raised her eyebrows, then smiled. “Instead of whether I can read minds, I’m actually more interested in Mr. Ye. I brought all of the stones you picked for me back. Aside from the two useless rocks that you specifically chose to hide the truth, all of the other rocks gave out jade.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was shocked.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This woman is truly terrifying. How did she know I intentionally chose two pieces of useless rocks?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Mr. Ye, I’ve said it already, I have great observation skills,” Qu Qitong smiled faintly. “Your rate of choosing rocks with jade is a hundred percent. Even old experts that have been in the industry for several tens of years merely have a sixty percent rate. If it wasn’t because I’m rather realistic, I really would suspect you have x-ray vision!”</span></p>
