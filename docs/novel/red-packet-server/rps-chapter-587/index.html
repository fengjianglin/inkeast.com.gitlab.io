 <p><span style>Chapter 587 – Qiu Yuan – The Chosen One</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Holy woman of the Nine Li, isn’t that…” Fatty Yin muttered as he slowly walked towards Sun Yige.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This has nothing to do with her,” Ye Zichen stopped him, and blocked off his path towards Su Yige. “She’s not from the Nine Li.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She said it herself just now. She’s the holy woman of the Nine Li,” the black-robed person continued to speak in a hoarse voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen frowned, “I said she isn’t, so she isn’t. We don’t know each other, so don’t stick your head into my business.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The black robed person paused in confusion for a moment, then nodded, and walked to the side of the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty Yin maintained his gaze on Sun Yige and raised his eyebrows, “Ye Zichen, is she the holy woman of the Nine Li or not? If she really is, then she’ll be huge trouble in the future.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She isn’t,” Ye Zichen shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty Yin met Ye Zichen’s gaze for ten-odd seconds, but Ye Zichen refused to look away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whatever, you really are the same person. Even your choices are the same. I don’t care about so much. Since you said that, then I’ll pretend that she isn’t,” Fatty Yin shook his head with a smile, while his expression darkened slightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you come to find me for?” Ye Zichen yanked Fatty in away from Sun Yige’s side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty Yi chuckled, “Didn’t I say it earlier? I’m going to get you out. Mount Supreme has nothing to do with you anymore, but I do have some things to take care of before that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The Eight Formation Origin Chart surfaced above his head once more. Not long later, the scenery in front of them changed, and everyone, who were searching for treasures, returned to the Niflheim Hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">“What’s going on?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">“Why did we all suddenly return? Is it because time’s up?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But that senior didn’t say anything!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, many of the players fell into intense discussion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty Yin coughed twice, then slowly walked over to sit down on the throne as he squinted his eyes at the people underneath the throne’s dias.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All of you, quiet down.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who’s this guy? He isn’t the senior from earlier.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">“I didn’t see him when we were forming teams earlier…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on with Mount Supreme!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">“Be quiet!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty Yin slapped the armrest of the throne, and released terrifying pressure that instantly turned everybody else silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">“Mount Supreme’s games ends here. From now on, you can choose to search for treasures within Mount Supreme, or you can choose to leave,”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Whoosh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A huge door appeared at the end of the hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That leads to the outside of Mount Supreme. You can leave now if you want. Of course, the original owner of Mount Supreme did not lie to you. There are opportunities here, but at the same time, it is also filled with danger. If you want to take your chances, then you can stay here as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Mu Chengtian begun to walk out with a tremble. Qiu Yuan also wanted to sneak out…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Get back here!” Ma Teng raised his hand and grabbed Qiu Yuan once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Fatty Yin also spoke up, “Which of you is called Qiu Yuan here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qiu Yuan, who was being dragged by Ma Teng, immediately raised his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty Yin nodded, then glared at Ma Teng, causing the latter to immediately smash against the wall behind him with a cough of blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">“Come over here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qiu Yuan gulped, then walked over, “Senior.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This armor is for you,” Fatty Yin took out an armor from his spatial artifact and placed it onto the floor. “Drip a drop of a blood on it and bind it to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The surrounding people couldn’t help but feel envious when they saw it. The armor seemed to be even stronger than the bell that had been given to Gou Yuzhan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior, I’m not interested in cultivation. I think I don’t need this armor. There are plenty of people stronger than me here, you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I said it’s for you, so it’s for you!” Fatty Yin said plainly, then grabbed Qiu Yuan’s arm, and stabbed it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ouch!” Qiu Yuan leaped up in pain, while blood flowed down from his arm onto the armor.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Drip.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment blood soaked through the entire armor, it lit up and disappeared into Qiu Yuan’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Then, a teleportation gate appeared by Fatty Yin’s side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Walk through this gate. Mount Supreme’s Duan Gu’s inheritance lies behind the gate. Now go!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Everyone else in the hall looked towards the gate with a heated gaze. If they were able to get the inheritance of Mount Supreme’s master, they would definitely become the strongest person in the Three Realms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior, I’m not going to cultivate!” Qiu Yuan sobbed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go in, or do you want me to kick you in?” Fatty Yin knitted his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“O-Okay,” Qiu Yuan said with a troubled manner, then walked into the teleportation gate unwillingly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Fatty Yin also snorted at the others, “I know some of you are displeased, but let me tell you. That kid is Mount Supreme’s Chosen One. It’s natural for the inheritance to be given to him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>None of the people in the hall dared to retort. After all, the fatty’s strength had already far surpassed theirs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if Qiu Yuan was not the Chosen One, they wouldn’t dare to go against Fatty Yin’s words.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">“Alright, before Qiu Yuan finishes accepting the inheritance, Mount Supreme will remain open to the public. I’ll set down some seals later so that those above the early stage of the Sky Immortal level will be unable to enter. That means some Sky Immortal leveled people will be able to enter. However, there is no need for you to worry. I will set up a mirage formation so that anyone who enters will lose their direction. Whether you can find a treasure will be up to your luck. Let me say it once more, if you want to leave, then the door is right here. If you don’t want to, then… good luck.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">With that, Fatty Yin walked in front of Ye Zichen and raised his eyebrows. “Come with me, this has nothing to do with you anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you guys going to stay? Or are you coming with me?” Ye Zichen looked towards Zuo Mo and co.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll stay. It wasn’t easy coming down. If I don’t bring a few divine artifacts back, the clan elders will cause trouble for me,” Bai Hai smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m staying here too,” said Ruan Qingtinan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then are the rest of you coming out?” Ye Zichen glanced at the others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They all nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Ye Zichen picked Tiantian up with a smile, then looked towards Fatty Yin, “Let’s go!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Outside Mount Supreme.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Su Liu’er held her hands tightly together and paced in front of Mount Supreme. Although only several minutes had passed since the fatty went after Ye Zichen, she was still extremely anxious.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Whoosh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen and co. suddenly appeared outside Mount Supreme. The moment they appeared, many people crowded around them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">“Little friend Ye, I wonder if our…” the three Yao Emperors immediately asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows, then thought back to the three people who didn’t stay with them, “They should have stayed inside to look for treasures.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">“I see,” the female Yao Emperor nodded in comfort. “About the things that you wanted us to give you before you enter…”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">“Move aside!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">At that moment, Su Liu’er shouted, and pushed everyone else in order to walk in front of Ye Zichen, then looked at him in such a way that if looks could kill, he would have been dead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Liu’er-jie.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come with me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Su Liu’er grabbed Ye Zichen’s arm and began to leave.</span></p>
