 <p><span style>Chapter 314 – Troubled Brothers</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen chose to stay in an express inn nearby. When he got into his room, he laid on the bed and thought about what the fatty had said. He had chosen to ignore the fatty because the brat was just too annoying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, when he calmed down and thought about it, the fatty’s words did have some truth to them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Indeed, he was able to act in a powerful manner in Bingcheng. That was because he had Wei Chen and the Hou Brothers protecting him. Even if he faced something that he couldn’t deal with, they would be able to deal with it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he was a complete foreigner in the capital. It would be embarrassing if he failed at showing off in front of someone with a really powerful background.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A more important point was that Bingcheng did not have many Rogue Immortals. However, there were plenty of hidden families in the capital. If Ye Zichen bumped into them and got bullied, he could only suffer silently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since he had nothing better to do, he took out his phone and opened WeChat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen saw that plenty of friends in real life had sent him a message. Most of them asked him why he didn’t come to class, and after replying all of them, he set his gaze upon Su Yan’s message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You went over to the capital?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen did not mention going to the capital with anyone except Su Yiyun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fact she knew clearly meant that Su Yiyun had told her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm, I did.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment he sent the message, Su Yan instantly replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you arrive yet? Do you have some place to stay? Be more careful over there. Don’t be too eye-catching. You’ve got a temper, so don’t cause trouble.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The warm words caused Ye Zichen to raise the corner of his lips slightly. Since she had intentionally avoided him for so long, he did not expect that she would actually talk to him just because he had went over to the capital.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understand, I’ll stay put.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows and took out a Thousand-Li Tracking Sigil form the Treasure Chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Target lock on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, a scene appeared in front of Ye Zichen’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan hugged a brown teddy-bear in a dark room. The light from the phone’s screen illuminated her beautiful face. However, there was no hint of a smile on it at all, as her eyebrows knitted together in a look of worry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen subconsciously raised his hand to help smoothen her brows, but when his hand touched the image…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He realized that it was just an image.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s good,” Su Yan’s face displayed her worrying cease as she sent the reply to Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm. Take good care of yourself in BIngcheng. If you have anything on your mind, then talk to me about it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen replied in a testing manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m fine, I don’t have anything on my mind.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After sending the message, Su Yan stretched lazily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, it’s getting late, so I’m going to rest. Sleep earlier, and don’t stay up too late.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the image, Su Yan put her phone onto the shelf by her bed, then laid down on the bed with a wry smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen frowned when he saw her like this.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>She is obviously in a bad mood right now. Why is she deliberately hiding it from me? Could it be that she’s in some sort of trouble that she didn’t want to tell me about?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen squinted his eyes, then used his phone to dial Wei Chen’s number.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Ye, you landed safely?” Wei Chen chuckled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen answered simply, then raised his eyebrows at Su Yan’s look of worry, “I landed safely. Oh yeah, help me find out if Su Yan is in some sort of trouble. If there is, then deal with it for me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Su Yan? Sure, no problem!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After finishing giving Wei Chen orders, Ye Zichen laid on the bed and slowly closed his eyes as his eyes as he looked at the image of Su Yan in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Early next morning…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pale light shone through the window onto Ye Zichen’s face. He woke up blurrily, then after a simple wash-up, he picked up his phone from the shelf next to his bed…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His phone suddenly rang. Ye Zichen opened WeChat, and saw that someone new had sent him a friend request.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He took a look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Marshal Horse has sent you a friend request.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Who the hell is Marshal Horse?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen examined the person’s profile picture closely, then notice that it seemed to be Horse-Face of the Underworld.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Accept.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Ox-Head, do you think he will lend me the money when I ask him?” Horse-Face sat on a stone chair, while Marshal Ox-Head sat opposite him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How would I know? You maxed out your card while picking up girls, so you came to me, but it isn’t like you don’t know what sort of situation I’m in. Think about how long we haven’t worked for. Since you don’t have the money, did you really think I would?” Ox-Head said helplessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I just thought that you might have some savings? I didn’t expect that you borrowed it from others as well,” Horse-Face sighed. “Also, why hasn’t the rich ghost servant that you talked about added me? Do you think that he might know I want to borrow money, so he didn’t accept the request?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That little brother isn’t someone like that,” Ox-Head said with confidence. “If you need help, then he will definitely help. He was the one who lent me the money when the bank dunned me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ai, then I hope he will accept my friend request later!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment he said that, the communication device in his hand that looked like a phone buzzed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I have accepted your friend request. Let’s chat!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Ox-Head, that little brother added me. Hahaha…” Horse-Face opened his mouth wide.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ox-Head smiled plainly, “I told you he would accept, right? Tell him about your situation. Remember, don’t mention me. I still owe that little brother money, so you asking him as well isn’t that great of a thing. Oh yeah, lower your status when you speak as well…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When have we put on airs before?” Horse-Face sighed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even since the Underworld’s and the Heavenly Court’s relationship worsened, Ox-Head and his days in the Underworld just got worse and worse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s true,” Ox-Head let out a long sigh, giving off a pitiful feeling to onlookers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Marshal Horse-Face, I wonder what business do you have with this little one?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was not familiar with Marshal Horse. He had seem Marshal Horse talk a lot in the group, but they have never chatted there before.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>But his intimacy level is alright!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Friendly.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>At least it isn’t cold, so he definitely did not come to cause trouble.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Little brother, I wonder what you’re doing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Horse-Face started off like a friendly neighbor, causing Ye Zichen to be confused. Since he didn’t know Horse-Face’s true thoughts, Ye Zichen could only smile and reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Waiting!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see!” Horse-Face smiled, then eyed Ox-Head who was beside him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ox-Head continuously gave signals towards him, so he clenched his teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, let me tell you the truth. Actually, I want to borrow some merits from you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s going on?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ox-Head had just borrowed some from me a few days ago, and now Horse-Face too?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>They really are troubled brothers.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But since I don’t have anything to do with the merits, then alright. What’s more, I can even be their debtor, so if I go to the Underworld in the future, or have some business with the Underworld, it’ll be easier to handle.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, tell me, how much do you want to borrow?”</span></p>
 <p></p>

 <p><strong>Horse-Face:&nbsp;</strong>Big Brother Ox-Head, can I ask you something?</p>
 <p><strong>Ox-Head:&nbsp;</strong>Sure, what is it?</p>
 <p><strong>Horse-Face:&nbsp;</strong>I... I... I want to ask you for...</p>
 <p><strong>Ox-Head:&nbsp;</strong>You can't possibly asking me for merits, right?</p>
 <p><strong>Horse-Face:&nbsp;</strong>Big Brother Ox-Head is right! I am asking for merits...</p>
 <p><strong>Ox-Head:&nbsp;</strong>It's not like you don't know my situation, I only JUST cleared my debt.</p>
 <p><strong>Horse-Face:&nbsp;</strong>I just thought that you might have some private savings...</p>
 <p><strong>Ox-Head:&nbsp;</strong>I don't. If I did, I would have used them to clear up the debt ages ago.</p>
 <p><strong>Horse-Face:&nbsp;</strong>Speaking of that, how did you clear up the debt?</p>
 <p><strong>Ox-Head:&nbsp;</strong>Oh, I was just about to recommend the little brother to you. He's great, and he was willing to lend me quite a lot of money as well. If you want to ask anyone for merits, then he's definitely the guy to ask.</p>
 <p><strong>Horse-Face:&nbsp;</strong>But what if he doesn't...</p>
 <p><strong>Ox-Head:&nbsp;</strong>Oh trust me. Little brother is a great ghost. I'm sure he will!</p>
