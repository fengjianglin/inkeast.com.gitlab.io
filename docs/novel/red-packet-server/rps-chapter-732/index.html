 <p><span style>Chapter 732 – The Jade Emperor’s Thoughts</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the Cloudy Palace of the Golden Arches.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All Ye Zichen saw in front of the palace was a gigantic stoic figure pillaring in front of the palace with a hint of boredom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Giant God,” Ye Zichen greeted the smile with a giant, who was someone that was rather active in the chat group as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had offered to go and welcome Ye Zichen at the South Heaven’s Gate, but unfortunately, his job was to guard the Cloudy Palace of the Golden Arches.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you guys here? And this is… Sky Sovereign?” Giant God bent down and raised his eyebrows at Ye Zichen, who only reached his waist in height.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although they have chatted quite a few times in the group, it was their first time meeting face to face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are far taller than I imagined,” Ye Zichen smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, Sky Sovereign, you are far shorter than I imagined,” Giant God scratched his head with a chuckle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not everybody ends up filled with hormones like you,” Yang Jian retorted, causing everybody to laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These deities all got along in private, so cracking a few jokes was no problem at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, I’m tall since I eat well. Oh yeah, what did you come here for? If you’re looking for the Jade Emperor, then you’re out of luck,” said Giant God.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that so?” Ye Zichen smirked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, Jade Emperor told me to stand guard here and said that if anyone was visiting, then tell them to come a few days later,” Giant God replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What a pity. Alright, then I won’t enter,” Ye Zichen did not stand firm on his reason, causing Flame Emperor to put on an anxious look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry, he ain’t going anywhere,” Ye Zichen reassured Flame Emperor, then turned to Giant God. “If you are allowed to go in and report, then tell the Jade Emperor that I, Ye Zichen, am in the Heavenly Court and would like to see him. Of course, I may be able to help him solve the problem he is having trouble with. He can come and find me at the True Lord Manor if he makes up his mind.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, he turned around with a smile, “Yang Jian, I wonder if it’ll be alright if I stay at your place…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Listen to yourself, I can’t ask for more! Don’t worry, just settle down.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then forgive my intrusion.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Intrude what? We’re all going there today to have a good chat!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen is here for you,” a purple-robed man with face as white as mutton jade blurted out within a secret room in the Cloudy Palace of the Golden Arches.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know,” said the golden-robed Jade Emperor. He had already lost the majestic look he always had.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His hair was like hay, his eyes were covered in a thick black circle, his mouth was slightly open like a fool… And his lifeless eyes stared at the dim light in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ve been researching this for half a month now, I’m sure you can tell that the ley line is not being of any use,” the purple-robed man said once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Jade Emperor took a deep breath and leaned back on his chair, “Heaven’s Equal, honestly, this is so strange. It was perfectly fine in the Immortal Region, why is it not working after I brought it over here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How would I know?” The purple-robed man frowned. This was the true form of the Great Sacred Emperor Equaling Heaven.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He received a message from the Jade Emperor a few days prior that the latter caught the ley line, that’s why he was in the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the ley line has already lost its effects after reaching the Heavenly Court. Neither of them could sense even the tiniest bit of spiritual energy fluctuation from it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Jade Emperor couldn’t get any more, the price he paid to reach this step was almost too much to handle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Yellow Emperor still has a greater understanding of the ley line compared to you. Otherwise, we would have found some clues during the years after he hid the ley line. If it really doesn’t work, then just return the ley line to him. Are you really that desperate to break through?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How could I not be?” The Jade Emperor shot up from his chair, while an intense unwillingness to accept everything spiraled in his eyes. “I should have ascended to the God Realm long ago. It was because the Yellow Emperor hiding the ley line away that I had to wait ten thousand years. Do you know how long that is? It may just be a snap of the fingers for cultivators, but I am at my limit. The Law has been rejecting me. I could not cultivate! I could only live through the last ten thousand years meaninglessly. Ten thousand years! Can you understand how I feel!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Great Sacred Emperor Equaling Heaven fell silent. The Jade Emperor was the strongest in terms of cultivation out of the strongest people in the Three Realms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since the Great Sacred Emperor Equaling Heaven has never suffered the Law refusing his attempt at cultivation, he did not feel like he had the right to judge the Jade Emperor for what the latter has done.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have to ascend as fast as possible no matter what!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Knock knock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The furious Jade Emperor suppressed his anger, “Who is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty, Sky Sovereign Ye was at the Cloudy Palace of the Golden Arches,” said Giant God outside the door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I got it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He asked me to leave a message for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign said that he really wants to see you and said that he might be able to help you solve the problem you have. If you make up your mind, then find him at the True Lord Manor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jade Emperor remained silent.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So he found out.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Jade Emperor knew that he couldn’t hide it for long, but he wasn’t willing to accept that he didn’t gain anything from the ley line.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I got it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then this subordinate will be taking his leave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the footsteps outside the room faded away, the Great Sacred Emperor Equaling Heavens spoke up, “If it isn’t going to work, then return this ley line. He said that he can help you solve your problem, so it’s clear that he knows that you have the ley line and that the ley line lost its effects in your hands.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So what?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then we might as well sit down and have an open chat. I’m sure Ye Zichen is not an unreasonable person. If you tell him your problem, he will help you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Help me?” Jade Emperor snorted. “If he really wanted to help me, then he should have hid the ley line a bit later. I would have ascended to the God Realm in just three days! Would I even have been here for so long if not for him? Help me? Sure.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You… Ugh, I’m speechless,” the Great Sacred Emperor Equaling Heavens let out a long sigh when he saw the Jade Emperor get overcome with rage. “Then what can you even do now? You didn’t figure anything out in half a month, so are you going to keep trying to figuring it out? Or rather, do you think that he will continue waiting while you do that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That’s fair.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Half a month has already passed, but I didn’t figure anything out.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What is the point of continuing doing this?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s more, would he really let me continue my research forever?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Give me an extra half-day. If I really don’t figure it out, then I’ll go and find him myself!”</span></p>

 <p>Things have been a lot busier in real life than I would have liked them to be, but regardless I’m sure you guys don’t care for the reasons. Either way, things are starting to settle down for me now, so I can indeed start posting properly again and play catch up like I intended to. I know it’s not much, but let’s start with 2 RPS chapters today.</p>
