 <p><span style>Chapter 377 – Substitution</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within the interrogation room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sat on the chair with a despondent look on his face. The police officer from the scene walked over and placed his notebook on the desk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I got a brief understanding of the situation from Guo Jing. I feel like we can’t press any charges against you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded silently, then after a long while he finally spoke up, “Did… they all die?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They’re all dead,” the police officer nodded in confirmation. “The murderer committed suicide after killing all the victims. The situation of the case is definite now, there is nothing else to truly investigate. You are safe now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that so!” Ye Zichen smiled wryly as he stood up from his chair. When he walked of the interrogation room, he saw that people he knew were all waiting from him outside the door. Not only Su Yan and co. were there, even Liu Jing’s father, Commissioner Liu was there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You also came!” Ye Zichen smiled wryly once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Commissioner Liu nodded, “I heard that you got into some trouble from Lil’ Zhang, so I came over to take a look. How is the situation?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m fine,” Ye Zichen shook his head with a smile. “You should receive the report from your subordinates very soon…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the officer who chatted with Ye Zichen walked out. When he saw Commissioner Liu, he quickly walked over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Commissioner Liu, why did you come? That being said, I do have a case I want to talk with you about, could you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Commissioner Liu and the police officer left, Ye Zichen and co. also exited the police station. During their journey back, Ye Zichen was in a very foul mood…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Murder.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Suicide!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why did she do something like that?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s phone buzzed. When he took out his phone, he saw that it was a message from White Impermanence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where are you? Let’s meet. We haven’t met up in so long!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where are you now?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows and asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m still at Polytechnic University. I’ve only just now caught the ghosts….” White Impermanence replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then wait there for me. I’ll come back immediately!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Approximately some ten-odd minutes later, Ye Zichen immediately raced to the girls’ dormitory after returning back to school. There, White Impermanence waited for him as she wandered around while yanking four spiritual bodies along.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, you came!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she saw Ye Zichen, she immediately ran over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen took a glance at the ghosts in her hands. Those ghosts were the girls in Yao Yue’s room, but what was strange was that all of them had a blank look on their face. Even when they saw Ye Zichen, they did not act like they recognized him at all.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Strange.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows, then suddenly noticed that Yao Yue’s spirit was not present.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You only caught four ghosts here? Didn’t five die?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When I came out, they did say that five died, but I only found the four of them here. These little fellows are rather pitiful, they had a spiritual and a physical soul taken away from them. Even if they go through the cycle of reincarnation, they will only be idiots!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>A spiritual and a physical soul taken away!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was shocked. King Qinguang had told him before that many of the ghosts entering the Underworld lacked a spiritual and a physical soul…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had once suspected that to be the work of the demons. </span><i><span style>Did the demon race already stretch their claws over here?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But, where did Yao Yue’s soul go?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Strange, too strange.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen knitted his eyebrows tightly…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Fiery Eyes of Truth, activate!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A faint golden light surfaced from his eyes. When he looked towards the girls’ dormitory, he noticed that there was no demonic energy in the dormitory at all.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>If a demon actually came, then the demonic energy here should be intense.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Even if a long time has passed, there should still be traces of it.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But, I can’t feel any demonic energy here at all.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, what are you thinking?” White Impermanence waved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did Ye Zichen return to his senses with a smile, “It’s nothing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm, I just wanted to come and see you. The Underworld is rather busy, so I have to hurry back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, then keep doing your thing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>White Impermanence then disappeared with the female ghosts instantly. After that, Ye Zichen gazed at the girls’ dormitory… For a long time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, in a room inside a commercial hotel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Jing sat on the sofa within the room in a bathrobe, while a smiling man was beside her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How is it? Are you used to this body?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s alright,” Guo Jing nodded indifferently. “But using someone else’s body is still troublesome. When her parents called just now, I was rather worried.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s there to worry about? Just use her body calmly!” the man smiled darkly and took out a small glass vial from his pocket. “Guo Jing’s soul is inside this vial. If you don’t understand anything, then ask her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Soul?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t try to know too much. We’re just cooperating,” the man smiled darkly once again. “From now on, you’re Guo Jing. I will tell you what you need to do in the future.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Actually-Actually, I feel like this is enough, I don’t want to do anymore!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s no longer an issue of whether you want to, my darling!” the man patted Guo Jing’s cheek with a smile. “From the moment you agreed to my terms of exchanging bodies, you’re already in on this. It’s impossible for you to give up halfway! Now, just calmly work for me, I… will not treat you badly!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then when can I return to my own body!” Guo Jing frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That would depend on how obedient you are,” with that, the man opened his bathrobe and spread his legs. “Come, my darling!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Ye Zichen left the girls’ dormitory, he did not return to his own dorm, and instead returned to his mansion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did you rush back in such a hurry?” Ye Rong couldn’t help but raise her eyebrows when she saw how desperate Ye Zichen looked. “Wait a moment, Mom will go and wash some fruits for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need!” Ye Zichen quickly stopped his mother. “I came here because there is something I want to trouble you with.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can you feel the existence of demons in Bingcheng?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Mother Ye immediately closed her eyes, while her body shimmered with a holy light. Not long later, she opened her eyes once more and shook her head, “No. What is it? Did the demons stretch their claws to Bingcheng?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rage flashed across Mother Ye’s eyes. She had no affable feeling towards any of the demon race at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“N-No, I’m just asking,” Ye Zichen shook his head with a coy smile. “There really isn’t anything, keep doing what you were going to do!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ai, then mom will go and wash some fruits for you,” Ye Rong turned around and left without thinking too much into it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Lil’ White ran over with his tongue out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, you’re looking for demons?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhm,” Ye Zichen nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ White immediately replied, “I can sense where the demons are!”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Original Chapter Teaser:</b>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Sigh... It's been a few days already, but I still don't understand why everything turned out like that.</p>
 <p>Yao Yue was the one who dumped me, so why did she try to make others believe that she was till my girlfriend? Is money and fame really that important? And also, when we confronted each other, why did she end up going to such extremes?</p>
 <p>She could I stopped, and I gave her so many chances to... Why did she had to make me use my last card? I didn't want to ruin her. Yes, we might have gone our different ways, and yes, she did publicly shame me quite a few times, but I thought we've moved on past that. Just... Why?</p>
 <p>I cannot comprehend the meaning behind her actions, but perhaps, it is all my fault.</p>
 <p>I suppose I should still do something for the families of the victims. Even if it may not be my fault, I did indirectly affect everything.</p>
