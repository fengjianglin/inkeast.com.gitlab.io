 <p><span style>Chapter 109 – Old Lord Taishang got kicked</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen ignored Su Yiyun’s shouts of protest, then pushed him out of the supermarket before locking the door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen watched Su Yiyun indicate some stuff for a while before his phone vibrated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You grandson, you’re burning the bridge after you crossed the river!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen laughed, and replied him with “we’ll talk later”, causing Su Yiyun, who was outside, flip him a middle finger before leaving.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did the deities come find you?” Liu Qing, who was always around Ye Zichen, knew all his secrets, so Ye Zichen wasn’t surprised that she could guess it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded and sat down, while Liu Qing floated behind him and stared at his phone with a curious look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cough, cough, this sovereign is here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: You’re too slow, I, Old Sun, was about to return to Mt. Huaguo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha: Hehe, I finished my Nutri-Express. &lt;insert a row of drooling emojis&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: Celestial Sovereign, what do you want Old Pig to do?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Feeding the dog right now. Keep chatting, I’ll just look at the history later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: Celestial friend, we finished the conference, shouldn’t we talk about the stuff from the other day?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang: Hurry.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hurry.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Heh.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled coldly, then directly kicked Old Lord Taishang out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ya, why did you move him out of the group?” Liu Qing covered her mouth and exclaimed in shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at her and cursed, “Did you forget that this old guy was raising the price with me at the police station the other day? Can I spoil someone like him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But he’s Old Lord Taishang, isn’t him amazing in the Heavenly Court!” Liu Qing clearly already accepted Ye Zichen’s secret. More importantly, she completely believed in the existence of the Heavenly Court now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The heck use is being amazing? Which one in my group isn’t amazing in the Heavenly Court?” Ye Zichen laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, he saw Old Lord Taishang sent him a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Celestial friend, what was that for?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What was that for!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Heh.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen waved his hand and directly deleted Old Lord Taishang from his contact list.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen returned to the chat group, he saw the people in the group all ask. Thus, he could only reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I just cleared out the parasite in the group, let’s continue.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: Celestial friend, are you talking about Old Lord Taishang?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Yeah, him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha: What did the grandpa do?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: Mm, good kick. Old Sun didn’t like the look of this geezer since ages ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: Old Pig doesn’t care about that much.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Woof, woof…</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>Around the South Heaven Gate <a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> in the heavenly Court, Old Lord Taishang looked at the chat on Yue Lao’s phone in anger.</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old fellow, don’t be too angry, I’ll get the Heavenly Sovereign to add you back in,” Yue Lao smoothed his beard and chuckled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Old Lord Taishang glared, “Heh, no need.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Old Lord Taishang called a cloud over and left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: Old Lord Taishang is angry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: Hey, what does him being angry or not have to do with us?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey bro’s words truly spoke out Ye Zichen’s thoughts. What could he do if he was angry?</span></p>
 <p><span style>One less of his type didn’t matter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just let him be angry, we’ll chat ourselves.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone replied continuously, clearly having forgotten about Old Lord Taishang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at the price list of the snacks on the supply list and smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everyone, please wait a moment, I’ll make a price list.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was very simple to do, all he had to do was add a 0 at the end of the unit price.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For example, a bottle of sprite was 3 yuan, then it would be sold for 30 cultivation experience in the Heavenly Court. Of course, this was all an estimate, the actual price would depend on the sales later on</span></p>
 <p><span style>If the sales were high, then he’ll raise the price.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every market did exactly what Ye Zichen does.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It could be said that Ye Zichen had completely cured his disease of dragging everything along for the flowing cultivation experience in the future.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within a short hour, he finished making the price list, then went out to photocopy a few before &nbsp;he returned to the chat group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cough, cough, is everyone still here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: You’re too slow, everyone would be gone soon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: Sky Sovereign, you have to pay more attention to the time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These were the only two that replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where is Yue Lao, Third Prince and Erlang Shen?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: Nezha is acting moe over there, Yue Lao is playing Go with a bunch of geezers, Erlang Shen is showing off his muscles with the fairies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: Hee, they all stay here, but Monkey Bro and I aren’t very familiar with the people in the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately understood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>@Third Prince Nezha, @Erlang Shen, @Yue Lao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Bro, you’re finally back. I would have been taken advantage of completely if you made us wait any longer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: &lt;smirk emoji&gt; I think you enjoyed it quite a bit just now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha: Hehehe, everyone likes me so much.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: Celestial friend, you’re finally back. This old one can’t take it much longer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but feel a bit moved when he saw the deities helping him so full heartedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This sovereign will remember everyone’s aid. I won’t say too many words of thanks. Everyone can enjoy three thousand cultivation of goods from this sovereign.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: Celestial friend is courteous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha: Hehehe, how many bottles of Nutri-Express can three thousand cultivation experience buy?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: Stingy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but feel speechless when all the deities in the group were happy, but Monkey King felt that he was stingy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen directly scanned the price list in his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal received your red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao received your red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King received your red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen received your red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha received your red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: What is this, it is actually so thin, but there are characters printed on it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: It’s the same texture as the book bro gave me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: What treasure is this, it doesn’t seem like it can be eaten.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha: It can’t be eaten.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marsah: Cries… (He seems to have eaten it already)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is the product price list of the products this sovereign will sell in the future. You are my spokespeople as well as my commercial agents. You can choose to import goods from me, then sell it at a higher price, or bring customers to buy from my store. I will give you guys discounts when you buy it products from me in the future.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: So, celestial friend means that we can get treasures from celestial friend, sell it in the Heavenly Court and earn the difference?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha: That’s good too. Can all of these be eaten?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: Heh, I, Old Pig, isn’t going to do this. If I import the stuff, I finish it very quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Older people were truly wiser. Just look at the geezer Yue Lao, he already understood everything without any explanation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, Yue Lao is right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: Where are the products? How can we sell without the products?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait a moment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he said that, Ye Zichen walked down to his basement storage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked at the organized products many kind that filled the entire storeroom.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>These were all money.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>This entire storeroom of goods had to have cost at least several tens of thousands yuan.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clenched his teeth!</span></p>
 <p><span style>If you don’t take risks, then you won’t get any huge rewards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Send them all.</span></p>
