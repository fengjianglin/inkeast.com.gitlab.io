 <p><span style>Chapter 600 – Leyline</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the Demon Dragon Palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Several dragons in a different posture were engraved on the four main pillars within the hall. At the very end of the hall sat Lord Black Dragon on top of a throne, who looked down on Ye Zichen with a cold smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the two sides stood the Twelve Demon Sovereigns of the Demon Realm, alongside some acquaintances of Ye Zichen…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Such as Su Yiyun, Gu Li, and Li Min’e!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yellow Emperor!” Black Dragon chuckled and nodded towards Ye Zichen. “Grant him a seat!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lord Black Dragon, there is no need for that. I understand my position rather well. I’m merely your prisoner right now, so let’s forgo the seat. I feel more comfortable standing up,” Ye Zichen refused Black Dragon’s good will.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon nodded, “Alright, since Yellow Emperor has said so, then I shall not force the issue.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Also, there is something I would like to correct. I don’t deny being the Yellow Emperor’s reincarnation, but I dislike being called the Yellow Emperor,” Ye Zichen smiled, yet a sort of determination remained in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon chuckled speechlessly. He did not expect Ye Zichen to speak to him using such a powerful attitude in this sort of circumstance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brat, do you know where you are!?” The bald one amongst the Twelve Demon Sovereigns shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bael!” Black Dragon scolded the bald one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The baldie snorted towards Ye Zichen and went quiet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Black Dragon also responded, “Heroes truly come from a young age. Little friend Ye is truly braver than all the others. You are the first to dare to speak to me like this ever since the name of Black Dragon became known.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pursed his lips with a light smile without answering.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon gripped the handle of his throne, and leaned over and observed Ye Zichen with his gray eyes, “Are you not afraid of death?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Would you kill me?” Ye Zichen looked up with a soft smile still on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two of them met gazes for thirty seconds or so, Black Dragon laughed loudly and clapped as he shook his head repeatedly, “Interesting, interesting…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Likewise!” Ye Zichen continued to wear his faint smile, as if he didn’t care about the danger so close at hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Twelve Demon Sovereigns looked towards the two with different reactions. Su Yiyun, in particular, never allowed his gaze to leave Black Dragon, and silently pondered just what Black Dragon was up to.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, Gu Li could not wait anymore. He had brought Ye Zichen over to see him get executed by Black Dragon. However, from the looks of it, Black Dragon had no such intentions at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lord Black Dragon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know what you want to say,” Black Dragon interrupted Gu Li. “Little Friend Ye is an important guest of the Demon Realm. Don’t ever mention your thoughts again!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Black Dragon brought the sealed Xuan-Yuan Sword over with a smile, “Xuan-Yuan Sword, the number one primordial divine artifact.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is Lord Black Dragon interested?” Ye Zichen smiled again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon nodded, “Naturally. I am a normal person, so how could I not be interested? Yet…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He returned the sword to the box and looked towards Ye Zichen, “Tell me where the ley line is. As long as you do that, then I would naturally return Xuan-Yuan Sword to its rightful owner.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t understand what Lord Black Dragon is talking about?” Ye Zichen replied, still smiling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The reason there has been no new gods in the Three Realms for tens of thousand of years is due to the Yellow Emperor sealing the ley line. As the reincarnation of the Yellow Emperor, I’m sure you know where it is,” Black Dragon smiled in a heart-chilling way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you tell me, then I can treat you as the most important guest in the Demon Realm. I can disregard the entirety of the past, but if you don’t…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ll kill me?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Naturally I would not. I will never allow an enemy to leave with such ease. There are plenty of fun activities in the Demon Realm. Little friend Ye, would you like to test them for yourself?” Black Dragon raised his eyebrows with another smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No,” Ye Zichen shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then tell me!” Black Dragon slapped the armrest of his throne, shocking everyone in the hall with his sudden burst of aura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who had remained calm until that point, gulped. At that moment, he truly felt like he was on the verge of dying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lord Black Dragon, you have to give me some time to think, alright? I don’t have a particularly good impression of the Demon Realm, you should know that better than me. I cannot be sure that what you said was the truth. Treat me as the most important guest… Gu Li said that he would let my friends and I go if I gave him the Beast Fire, but he went back on his words as well,” Ye Zichen forced a calm smile onto his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon looked at him for a moment, “Alright, since that’s the case, then I’ll give you three days to consider. After that, if you don’t tell me, then don’t blame me for being inhumane!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, Black Dragon called out with a wave, “Send little friend Ye to the Ming Garden!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ones who guided Ye Zichen was Su Yiyun and Li Min’e. The two of them were acquaintances of his from the Modern Realm. Despite this, none of them spoke to one another during the walk, they did not look down on him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’re here,” Li Min’e suddenly said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen walked into the garden without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun seemed to want to say something, but in the end, he merely clenched his fist, and turned around silently with Li Min’e.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they finally left, Ye Zichen stopped walking and looked towards where Su Yiyun had left from with a sigh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The arrangement of Garden Ming was not glorious, but it was still far better than a prison cell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sat on the side of his bed while using spiritual energy to deflect the demonic energy around him. Actually, he did not need to do so as a Fallen, but he truly detested the aura of the Demon Realm from the depths of his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just what sort of thing are you planning?” Ye Zichen whispered towards his phone. “Xuan-Yuan Sword is sealed and the Beast Fire is gone from my body. What’s more, I don’t even know how or where Su Yan and Lu Lu are. You have to give me an explanation of why you told me to give up resisting, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: I naturally have my reasons for doing so. Su Yan and Lu Lu will not come into any danger, and Xuan-Yuan Sword will be unsealed. Do you not trust me?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I naturally do, that’s why I disregarded Xuan-Yuan Xiang’s objection and came with them,” Ye Zichen responded plainly. The reason he had done so in the first place was due to getting a message in his mind from the system.</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: That’s good. Since you believe me, then what do you have to worry about?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“At least tell me what your plans are. I was improvising the entire time. Thank god I was smart enough, otherwise, I might have died in the hall,” Ye Zichen twitched his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: No, even if you had been in danger, someone still would have protected you.</span></p>
