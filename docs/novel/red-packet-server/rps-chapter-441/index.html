 <p><span style>Chapter 441 – Gathering Allies</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King Li, who was sitting and chatting within his palace, was stunned. From the sounds of Erlang Shen and the Monkey King’s words, it seems like he was the only one who didn’t take a side yet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To be truthful, everything he said was just courteous words. Although he was an important general in the Heavenly Court and controlled an army, he was still the Jade Emperor’s subordinate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Jade Emperor had already forbid the deities in the Heavenly Court from even talking with Taibai Jinxing, so him entering the group was already giving Taibai Jinxing a lot of face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the words of Yang Jian and the shitty monkey clearly checkmated him, causing him to be unsure of what to do.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: @Pagoda-Bearing King Li, Geezer Li, where did you off to?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: Let me ask stealthily. What is eradicating demons?</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Little fairy, don’t ask so much about what you shouldn’t ask. But then again, the Jade Emperor…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: I nearly forgot. @God of Thunder, you have plenty of soldiers underneath your command, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Ahem…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing: Hehe, this old man doesn’t wish to trouble everyone. If you feel like it will be hard on you, then pretend like this old man didn’t say anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King Li: Taibai, you’re treating us like outsiders with your words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Yeah. To be honest, we do possess military forces, and since we’ve been comrades in the Heavenly Court for so many years, we do sincerely want to help you… But in the end, we’re under the Jade Emperor’s rule.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King Li: He said exactly what I wanted to say.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Basically, you’re just pussies. Look, why didn’t the monkey or I think so much?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mother of Lightning: You’re retarded, that’s something everyone in the Heavenly Court knows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Hey, little biatch, I was just saying, why did you insult me?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mother of Lightning: Little biatch?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: That’s a way of addressing beauties.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mother of Lightning: Oh, then I am a little biatch!</span></p>
 <p><span style>What Ye Zichen did not know that was Yang Jian’s words instantly called the phrase “little biatch” to become a new trend in the Heavenly Court. Whenever someone meets a rather pretty beauty, they would call her little biatch…</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, that’s irrelevant. Also, while these people were trying to gather allies in the group, Ye Zichen was not staying idle in private.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He went into his chat with Third Prince Nezha, but when he saw the moe shota profile picture, all of a sudden, Ye Zichen felt rather reluctant.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I would feel really bad for trying to fudge with the little guy.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, he quickly discarded his tiny bit of conscience. </span><i><span style>Just what is my conscience worth compared to my life, the Modern Realm and the Three Realms?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahem, Third Prince, what are you doing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nezha, who was playing ball with Immortality Peach Fairy in the Immortality Peach Garden, immediately put down the ball and smiled towards Immortality Peach Fairy, “Immortality Peach-jiejie, wait for me for a moment. Sky Sovereign sent me a message.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm, hurry up and talk to Sky Sovereign. Big Sis is going to watch from the side,” Immortality Peach Fairy answered with a giggle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha nodded heavily, then tapped his reply on the screen. “Sky Sovereign, I’m kicking a ball with Immortality Peach-jiejie. What did you find me for?’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy is there too?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye ZIchen squinted his eyes, but he quickly put the thought of her being there aside. </span><i><span style>This girl’s mindset is around that of a seventeen or eighteen year old. If it really ends up being an issue, I’ll just fudge with her as well.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Third Prince is actually playing ball with Immortality Peach-meimei, so fun!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, Sky Sovereign called me meimei,” Immortality Peach-meimei giggled and cheered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha also nodded and typed out his reply with a smile. “Mhmm…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How can you reply so simply?” Immortality Peach Fairy smacked the Third Prince’s head and snatched over the phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, do you want to accept Immortality Peach Fairy as your little sister? That’s a smart, intelligence, lively, cute, bright, generous and kind girl!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Ye Zichen saw this message, he guessed that Immortality Peach fairy was the person who sent it. He sighed speechlessly, then replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Immortality Peach Fairy, it’s you, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, why can’t I deceive Sky Sovereign?” Immortality Peach Fairy giggled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen replied once again. “Actually, I did wish to accept you as my stepsister, do you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that really okay? If Sky Sovereign doesn’t mind, then I’m way too willing!” Immortality Peach Fairy replied without thinking. </span><i><span style>Being Sky Sovereign Nameless’ little sister is great.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I’ll gain a huge backing with such an older brother. </span></i><span style>What’s more, she has always been very curious about this mysterious Sky Sovereign as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s great,” Ye Zichen smiled, then replied on the screen again. “Hand the phone back over to the Third Prince. I have some things I want to discuss with him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay,” Immortality Peach Fairy giggled in response, then handed the phone over to Third Prince Nezha and placed her hands on her waist. “Chat properly with Sky Sovereign, Nezha.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha nodded heavily, then typed out a message on the screen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, do you have some business with me?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Good guess!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen thought silently to himself, then messaged Nezha.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I heard that Third Prince has control over the Heavenly Court’s soldiers?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, even though I’m short, I lead even more soldiers than my dad,” Third Prince Nezha put on a proud smile. Actually, he wrote the message for Immortality Peach Fairy, who was beside him. No matter how old he is, he’s still a guy… They all like to display their strong sides to the girls they like.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, those words were not so simple in Ye Zichen’s mind. </span><i><span style>More soldiers than Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King Li. That’s definitely huge control over the military.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I really lack power right now, if I can trick the Third Prince… Ahem, correction, persuade him to become my comrade, then he’ll definitely be a force to be reckoned with.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Does Third Prince like being a hero of justice?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course,” Third Prince answered without thinking. “My dad taught me to be an ally of justice and a hero since a young age… But the Heavenly Court is too peaceful, there is no way for me to become a hero.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have a way of becoming a hero of justice. Do you want to give it a try?” Ye Zichen smiled like the fake grandma – big bad wolf.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, Sky Sovereign, tell me what I should do!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Third Prince answered urgently. He likes Immortality Peach Fairy very much, but he can feel like she keeps on treating him like a kid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s why, he needed a way to prove himself, and show her how amazing he is.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Slay demons and defend justice!” Ye Zichen squinted his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha scratched his face when he saw the message. </span><i><span style>I seem to remember my dad telling me not to get involved in this matter…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, my dad isn’t letting me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then you don’t want to be a hero anymore?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I do, but what if I don’t listen and my dad hits me?” Third Prince Nezha said slightly helplessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, Ye Zichen squinted his eyes. </span><i><span style>No worries, I still have a backup plan…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Give your phone to Immortality Peach Fairy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nezha handed the phone obediently to Immortality Peach Fairy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After getting the phone, Immortality Peach Fairy immediately replied on the screen. “Sky Sovereign-gege, I read all your messages just now. What do you want me to do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Convince Third Prince Nezha. Will you have any issues doing that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s easy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy answered with certainty. She did have a way with the Third Prince.</span></p>
