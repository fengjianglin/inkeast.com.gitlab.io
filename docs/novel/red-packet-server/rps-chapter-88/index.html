 <p><span style>Chapter 88 – Ye Zichen? Gu Family?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Family home, Bingcheng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Ye, come and have a cup of tea.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Man Su personally poured a glass of Da Hong Pao [1. An expensive type of tea. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Da_Hong_Pao" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Da_Hong_Pao</span></a>] for Ye Zichen, completely shocking Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He quickly stood up and received the tea, “Old Man Su, don’t be so courteous.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Ye, you’re this old man’s savior, it’s not much to pour you a glass of tea.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Man Su revealed a slightly unhappy expression. No matter what, ever since Ye Zichen brought the old man from the brink of death, the old man’s health became much better and he looked a lot better than before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His entire person seemed extremely energetic. Ye Zichen could tell from that the Peach of Immortality was truly a miraculous item.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I have to get a few more Peaches of Immortality from the Heavenly Court when I have the chance.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen thought to himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was the most important thing for a person?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their life!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This sort of thing that can increase how long a person has to live might be able to sell for an astronomical amount in the circle of rich people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For people of their level, money was just a number.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were definitely very willing to use a bunch of useless numbers to exchange for ten-odd or twenty years of life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, the requirement would be…</span></p>
 <p><span style>That they believe this thing can increase how long a person has to live.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Ye, you came here to find my granddaughter?” Old Man Su revealed a faint smile after Ye Zichen finished the cup of tea.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded with a smile, “Su Yan said that there’s a reunion, and wanted me to go with her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that so? It seems like you and my granddaughter are developing pretty well!” Old Man Su smiled and held his chin with his right hand. “I definitely support you being with my granddaughter. You have to work hard, there are plenty of people pursuing my granddaughter.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded after hearing that, but couldn’t help but muttering in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I already got your darling granddaughter.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The affability level of 500 on the marriage string won’t lie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The lover relationship is confirmed.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So, we are lovers!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh yeah, Old Man Su, I heard that you gave the Monkey Wine to someone else? I’ll give you another gourd.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Man Su’s eyes immediately brightened after hearing that, causing him to push the Da Hong Pao on the table aside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry, hurry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen signaled Old Man Su to not be so anxious, then withdrew a gourd of Monkey Wine from the Treasure Chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye ZIchen placed the gourd onto the table. Since Old Man Su had already known about how mysterious Ye Zichen was while he was in ghost form, Ye Zichen felt like there wasn’t anything to hide from him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Man Su raised his eyebrows silently. Even though he had seen this before, he was still kind of shocked in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, his attention was quickly diverted by the Monkey Wine.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He pulled open the cork and took a sip.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“After so long, this wine still feels the best to drink.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Man Su leaned back on the chair, while the scent of the Monkey Wine spread through the entire courtyard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Qihu followed the scent over and saw Old Man Su, who was drinking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dad, why are you drinking again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, his expression turned rather unnatural when he saw Ye Zichen, who sat opposite Old Man Su.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He truly didn’t think much of Ye Zichen in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Delinquent-like, ruffian-like and opportunistic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had all the characteristics that a loser would have.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He could not accept handing his darling daughter into the hands of this sort of person, but yet it was this person that he didn’t think much of…</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the old man was near-death, and when the experts he invited, and all the other doctors in the hospital were unable to save the old man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was him that stood up and saved Old Man Su.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had also made a bet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A bet for his daughter’s happiness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, a hint of complexity appeared in the way Su Qihu looked at Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen laughed and stood up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uncle Su.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Qihu clearly did not expect Ye Zichen to greet him. He revealed a rare forceful smile on his expressionless face as a sign of good will.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Old Man Su also spoke up, “Stop watching me, okay? It’s not like the military region is not busy. What’s more, even if anything happens to me when I drink, isn’t Lil’ Ye here? Also, Lil’ Ye’s wine is truly different from normal wine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Oh yeah.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This wine is different from other wine.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Man Su might indeed be old, and his bodily functions did worsen, but he had the wine Ye Zichen gave him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As long as Old Man Su drank his wine, then Old Man Su’s body would only get better with age.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then why did Old Man Su suddenly enter the hospital, and caused the doctor to say that they couldn’t save him?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most importantly, Old Man Su had told him to pass along a message to Su Qigu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The light in Ye Zichen’s eyes flashed, while his heart turned sullen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Su Yan, who had gotten ready, stood outside the pavilion and waved to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Man Su smiled when he saw this, “Lil’ Ye, go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay, Old Man Su, Uncle Su, I’ll be off.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Qihu only sat down in Ye Zichen’s position when Ye Zichen and Su Yan disappeared from the courtyard and looked at Elder Su with a frown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dad, you can’t really be trying to get Lil’ Yan and that brat together, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s so bad about that?” A light flashed across Old Man Su’s eyes. “Lil’ Ye saved my life. What’s more, Su Yan also likes Lil’ Ye a lot, isn’t it great for them to be together?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You say that, but…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know what you want to say,” Old Man Su interrupted Su Qigu and sighed meaningfully. “Qihu, don’t you feel like Lil’ Ye is a lot like someone from a certain family?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Qihu was stunned for a moment. A family that Old Man Su would mention was definitely someone from the capital…</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter how much he thought about it, he couldn’t think of which family a little poor kid like Ye Zichen could be related to.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, the Gu family,” Old Man Su scolded in disappointment when he saw Su Qihu not speak up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Gu family,” Su Qihu, who was sitting, opened his eyes wide.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With his identity, there were very few things that could cause him to be surprised.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But the Gu family was not just a surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a total shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I told you very long ago that you have to learn to observe people. Say, after being in the military for so long, even though I never stuck a hand into your career, I’m still there, so they would still give me a bit of face. Then why are you still only a colonel now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Qihu remained silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was indeed like Old Man Su had said, he didn’t deal with relationships that well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He feels like just looking at the surface was fine. It was fine if he thought it was fine, if he thinks its not, then it’s not.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This caused him to offend quite a lot of people in the military. If it wasn’t for Old Man Su, he might not be able to retain his position of a colonel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then you think that brat is someone from the Gu family?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Qihu licked his dry lips and said after a long time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Gu family was definitely a powerful existence in the capital, and it was different from other renowned families.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was very mysterious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was above any family in the capital.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m only guessing, even if Lil’ Ye isn’t someone from the Gu family, I still support Lil’ Yan being with Lil’ Ye. Just don’t care about their matters in the future. The young people have their own ways of living.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Man Su took another sip from the wine gourd, while Su Qihu couldn’t help but nod after remaining silent for a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He really didn’t think much of Ye Zichen, but there are some things that couldn’t help but improve his impression of Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I understand.”</span></p>
