<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p><span style>Chapter 8 – Painting of Astronomical Value.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everybody was momentarily dazed the moment that the painting appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The owner of the painting clearly didn’t want other people to know of its existence, since he had stuck the painting to the inside of the vase.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen also smiled, the purple aura was coming from this painting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He took the painting out and unrolled it…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Real.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Yong and Xiao Hai pretty much said it at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Xiao, let’s go and admire the painting together within the store?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Yong invited Xiao Hai inside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Qiang’s face nearly turned purple. He stayed in the antique street through most of the year, so he could naturally tell that the painting was real.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A real work by Bada Shanren<sup><a id="ref1" href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> cost at least five million based on current market prices.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Damn, that was really bullshit luck.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Qiang-ge, that painting…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What painting, let’s go!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Qiang replied angrily and left the antique street with Yao Yue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I really didn’t think that there was actually one of Bada Shanren’s real works within this fake blue and white porcelain.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Yong couldn’t help but exclaim, yet, his face also revealed a wry smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man had gone to him to sell the blue and white porcelain first, if he had bought it, then the painting would naturally be his.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Liu Yong was someone that could accept things, what is meant to come will arrive, what is not meant to be should not be forced. This was something that he understood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Xiao Hai and Liu Yong, the two art lovers admired the painting within the store, Su Yiyun and Ye Zichen smoked outside as they chuckled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi, you’re rich.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you see Hai-ge’s expression? I’m telling you, Hai-ge is a lover of paintings, if he wants to buy it, he would definitely give you an astronomical price.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that so…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen replied absentmindedly. Of course he could tell that Xiao Hai was someone who loved paintings, but at the same time, he could tell that the pawn shop owner was the same.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If both of them wanted to buy it, what should he do...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just at that moment, Xiao Hai and Liu Yong walked out of the shop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Yong carefully placed the painting back in Ye Zichen’s hands, then looked towards him with something to say, before stopping himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Hai also did the same.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little bro, can I talk about something with you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Yong was the first to be unable to resist speaking up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please speak.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sighed in his heart, </span><i><span style>it really happened….</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you selling this painting? I want to buy your painting at the market price. However, I promise you that I definitely will not sell this painting, I just like it that much!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I actually let you say it first,” Xiao Hai shook his head and smiled. “Actually, I also want to buy this painting. The market price for this painting is about five million, I can give you seven million!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing Xiao Hai’s price, Ye Zichen suddenly raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Damn, seven million!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Su Yiyun was much calmer, he clearly understood Xiao Hai’s ability after knowing him for so long.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, how much can you give me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What can I say when Young Master Xiao already said seven million. I’m not afraid of you making fun of me, but the most I can give is five million to buy it at market price.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Yong had a troubled expression. He was someone that loved calligraphies and paintings, when he saw the real work of Bada Shanren, he naturally thirsted for it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unfortunately, his opponent was Young Master Xiao…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, then I’ll sell this painting to the shop owner for five million.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen hesitated momentarily, then placed the painting in the shop owner’s hands. At the same time, he also tried to explain his choice to Xiao Hai with a wry smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hai-ge, just now…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need to explain to me, Boss Liu is someone that is famous for loving paintings like his own life within the circle. Selling it to him is the same as &nbsp;giving the painting a good home. I merely collect them, I don’t mind whether I have it or not.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Hai waved his hands with a light smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After leaving the antique street, Ye Zichen couldn’t help but exclaim in his heart, while sitting in Su Yiyun’s car.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had easily earned five million just by going to the antique street once.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he clearly understood that this was only brought to him by that miraculous WeChat group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, he still felt a bit troubled. That Xiao Hai was clearly an impressive person. Someone that could pay seven million to buy a painting wasn’t someone that he could just mess with.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ol’ Three, Hai-ge isn’t going to get mad over this, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re thinking too much,” Su Yiyun snickered. “Hai-ge isn’t someone that petty. I’m telling you, when you sold the painting to Liu Yong, Hai-ge even told me that you were an interesting person.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Interesting person? It’s not a derogatory term, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, it is. Just wait for death. Hai-ge is someone with a reputation in Bingcheng, you actually sold it to Liu Yong instead of him. He is very angry, hurry up and let me safeguard your phone, bank card and stuff. If you die, then at least I can still hand it to auntie.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun swore in annoyance. Hearing that, Ye Zichen actually smiled happily in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Maniac.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Buzz…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s phone rang. When he picked up his phone, he raised his eyebrows. The person calling him was actually Commissioner Liu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Liu-ge, is your body fine?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, it is,” Commissioner Liu smiled happily. “Lil’ Ye, thank you so much for yesterday.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Liu-ge is too courteous.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, Lil’ Ye, the reason Liu-ge called you this time is to beg something of you. Do you have time to come over to Liu-ge’s?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was very nervous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Commissioner Liu was the commissioner of the city’s police department. He was merely a poor university student, Commissioner Liu begging him to do something didn’t seem right.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, since he said that, Ye Zichen couldn’t very well refuse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, then tell me the address Liu-ge, I’ll come over now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun asked after Ye Zichen hung up the call.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A call from Commissioner Liu?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded without denying anything and thought about the contents of the call just now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Commissioner Liu told me to go over to his place, so take me over there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They decided to meet at a high-class business club. The moment he arrived, Ye Zichen saw Commissioner Liu and Officer Zhang standing outside the club, as if they were waiting for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Ye.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Commissioner-Commissioner Liu?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it wasn’t for him hearing Commissioner Liu’s voice, Ye Zichen really wouldn’t be able to recognize him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Commissioner Liu was a normal middle-aged man over forty years old the previous day. Yet, as of right now, Ye Zichen would have suspected him of having plastic surgery if they had not met the previous day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t recognize me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Commissioner Liu chuckled. His chuckle was full of power, then he nodded when he saw Su Yiyun, who stood off to the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t this Old Su’s child?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Commissioner Liu.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun nodded with a smile, but was very shocked in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When everyone sat down, Ye Zichen was still drowning in the shock that Commissioner Liu had brought him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>How did a person change like this after a day!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Ye, Liu-ge waited here for you for so long.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Commissioner Liu…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, Ye Zichen didn’t know how to reply. Making the city’s police department’s police commissioner wait in person for him was definitely something he could brag about for a year.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t be courteous with your Liu-ge,” Commissioner Liu patted Ye Zichen’s shoulders. Then, a light flashed in his eyes, “Lil’ Ye, your family should be from there, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was completely confused!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>From there?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>From where?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing Ye Zichen’s reaction, Commissioner Liu shook his head and smiled lightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re still playing dumb with Liu-ge, isn’t it all thanks to your pill that Liu-ge can be like this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Commissioner Liu’s heart disease could only be said to be a lifelong problem, yet, he found out his heart disease was completely cured after his checkup today. Even his metabolism had returned to what is was when he was thirty years old.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From Lil’ Zhang’s words, he was certain that Ye Zichen was definitely someone from there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen continued to be confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Never mind! Liu-ge is also someone that knows the rules, so I won’t ask too much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Commissioner Liu shook his head with a smile. Hearing that, Ye Zichen asked while he was completely confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Commissioner Liu, what did you ask me to come here for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m bringing you to see a friend.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Commissioner Liu patted Ye Zichen’s shoulders and replied with a smile.</span></p>
