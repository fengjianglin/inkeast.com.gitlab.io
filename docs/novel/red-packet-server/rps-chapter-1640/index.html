 <p>In the Upper Three Realms, Imperial Kings were already rare and lofty existences. Reaching this level meant that both their talent and their lucky encounters were exceptional.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Outside, they were revered by the masses, the absolute rulers of their territories. Yet here in the Divine Mausoleum, they’d become nothing but juniors.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When they sensed the gazes of the imperial lords gathered at the foot of the mountain, they realized their mistake. If it were possible to go inside, how could they possibly have run into this group gathered outside?</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It wasn’t that they were dense; it was just that the good fortune before them had muddled their heads.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>They knew they’d asked an overly stupid question too, so they said no more. They simply walked silently over to the edge of the mountain. The imperial kings weren’t familiar with the imperial lords, and although they were mighty, overbearing figures on the outside, here, they were a vulnerable group. They had no choice but to huddle together for protection.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“So you’re not completely brainless.” Kui Lin watched those minor, irrelevant imperial kings leave in terror, then snorted coldly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Then, he turned and looked at Ye Zichen with great interest. An instant later, he felt several presences lock onto them. This scene only made his eyes light up with even greater playful curiosity.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Alliance Head Ye, no…. Star Master Ye.” Demon Emperor Kui Lin suddenly changed his form of address. “Star Master Ye, you hid yourself awfully well. If you hadn’t entered the mausoleum, I would never have guessed you were one of heaven’s chosen twin emperors. Earlier, when Gu Li told me it was you, I didn’t believe him at all.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Then why do you believe it now?” said Ye Zichen, not bothering to hide anything.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The others at the base of the mountain all looked towards them. Those who’d reached this level all had heard of the Emperor Star to varying degrees.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>They recalled the other emperors’ behavior, then considered what Kui Lin had just said.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Emperor Star!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Although Kui Lin had called him “Star Master”, the cleverer experts present could roughly sense what he was getting at.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“He’s the Emperor Star.” Some of the imperial kings muttered to themselves, and when they looked at Ye Zichen, their eyes blazed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The light of the Emperor Star was possible to steal; God Emperor Zhou Wu was a living example of this. This Emperor Star’s cultivation didn’t seem particularly high. If they could seize his imperial starlight…</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But they’d only just barely revealed a hint of enmity when they felt several presences lock onto them.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Every last one of them belonged to an imperial lord. Add that to the murderous intent they contained, and the imperial kings instantly squashed their budding ideas.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>If they attempted to seize Ye Zichen’s imperial starlight, they’d have to cross countless impassable mountains first.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“To think that brainless bunch would even consider laying their hands on your starlight.” Kui Lin narrowed his eyes and sneered. As the Demon Emperor, he could sense their hidden intentions clearly even though they weren’t directed at him. “Even I wouldn’t dare consider such a thing given the people around you. Really… How about I clean that bunch up on your behalf?” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>The imperial kings in question instantly froze on high alert, then silently unleashed their auras. If the Demon Emperor really attacked them, they wouldn’t just stand around and wait to die.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Even though they were doomed regardless!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“If you want to, I naturally don’t mind,” said Ye Zichen indifferently. “From my perspective, if you fight to the death amongst yourselves, it's a win regardless of the outcome.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Star Master Ye, you sure are clever. No wonder you made even the other Emperor Star one of your subordinates.” Kui Lin’s gaze swept across Gu Li. “It seems that the reason you disregarded the yao’s objections and ensured his safe departure was because you’d anticipated that this day might come! I, Kui Lin, am in awe of your calculations!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Hah…” Ye Zichen laughed humorlessly, but explained nothing. It was clear that Kui Lin and Gu Li really had had a falling out.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It was possible that they’d had a difference of political opinion that led to Gu Li choosing to leave the Demon Emperor’s alliance. Now, he was with Ye Zichen, so Kui Lin mistakenly assumed Ye Zichen had recruited him as his subordinate.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But none of that mattered now!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The demons had always been a thorn in Ye Zichen’s side. Furthermore, because of the former Demon Emperor, he was sure to clash with Kui Lin one day. If Kui Lin was still following Gu Li, given Ye Zichen’s relationship with An Lu, it would be hard to put his plans into action without scruples.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>If Gu Li had left the Demon Emperor’s alliance, that was good too! &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Besides, he was more concerned about what Kui Lin had just said. He was intimidated by the people gathered around Ye Zichen….? &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Demon Emperor, you said it wasn’t convenient to strike due to the people around me. Are you saying that, if they weren’t present, you’d…”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Star Master Ye, is there any need to even ask?” Demon Emperor Kui Lin laughed calmly. “The light of the emperor star is invaluable towards achieving transcendence. Who wouldn’t covet it?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You scumbag! I’ll cut you up here and now!” Yang Jian hefted his lance, but the Demon Emperor’s subordinates were no pushovers. The instant Yang Jian moved, they unleashed their auras too.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Their spiritual power clashed. A grand battle could break out in an instant.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Surprisingly, both Ye Zichen and the Demon Emperor raised their hands at once. Then, Kui Lin burst into laughter. “Star Master Ye, do you want to fight me? I don’t think there’s any need for that. I was just telling a truth others dare not speak. How about you ask that group behind you? Would they dare tell you that, in the face of imperial starlight, they’re not at all tempted?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Kui Lin, watch your tongue!” roared the Ocean Emperor.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“It seems I was right on the mark. Xue Yang, this isn’t the Sea of Innocence. Away from the ocean, do you really think I’m afraid of you?” asked Kui Lin, his aura gradually flourishing around him. “Back then, I merely sent a wisp of my divine sense. You won a petty victory over me, yes, but do you really think that makes you qualified to speak to this emperor like that?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Try it if you dare.”The Ocean Emperor didn’t even bother talking. He simply summoned his set of three Ocean God artifacts.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In a single breath of time, the space surrounding the mountain range filled with water vapor. The damp air moistened everyone’s clothing.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Ocean Emperor, don’t sink to his level. Those petty psychological attacks are no use at all.” Ye Zichen only laughed. “He might not know this, but I’m your Sea of Innocence’s son-in-law, and you’re my father-in-law! Even if I were to suspect someone, I wouldn’t suspect you, right?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Then are you saying you suspect me?” Xuan Ji arched her brow.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You’re my aunt!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“The I…”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Your daughter is my brother-in-arms! Besides, didn’t you want to marry her off to me? In that case, I’m practically your son-in-law….”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Then look at me! It’s not like you don’t know of my relationship with Su Yan.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“There’s even less need to bring up Liu Qing. We’ve shared a bed already! Although admittedly she was just a ghost back then…”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I…”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I…”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Zichen went around the circle. Now that he was saying it out loud, it seemed that he was a son-in-law to just about all of them.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Finally, only Chao Feng and the Hermit Emperor remained, their jaws hanging open. Ye Zichen glanced at them….</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“But I really can’t be sure about you!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Dammit, it seems I’ve got to hurry up and have a daughter!” said Great Emperor Chao Feng.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Little Friend Ye, this old man has a granddaughter. She’s twenty-eight….”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Don’t even say it. Twenty-eight? More like two hundred and twenty-eight!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As he watched the Hermit Emperor and Chao Feng turn against each other, Ye Zichen laughed and turned to look at Kui Lin. “Tell me… Are psychological attacks any use?”&nbsp;</p>
