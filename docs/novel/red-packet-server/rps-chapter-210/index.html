 <p><span style>Chapter 210 – The Fiery Eyes of Truth are back</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monthly Patent Earnings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cultivation Experience x250000</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gold ingot x340.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reputation x15.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows when he saw the news. This should be ten percent of the total earnings from his game.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked at the date on his phone. </span><i><span style>Payment is received on the fifteenth!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen didn’t care about the gold ingots and the Reputation so much… What he cared more about was that cultivation experience.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your official position in the Heavenly Court has been promoted. Current Celestial Official Level: 6</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen quickly clicked on the Treasure Chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Celestial Plate did show him as a Level 6 Celestial Official, but more importantly…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cultivation experience: 924948</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Can’t I buy the Fiery Eyes of Truth soon!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qianqian, who stood in front of him, stared idiotically at Ye Zichen, who was playing with his phone. She couldn’t help but curse in her heart.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why isn’t he reacting when I offered to treat him to a meal!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>No matter what, I am a school beauty of the Polytechnic University.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Ye Zichen looked up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qianqian also suppressed her wish to retort, “Erm, I…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior, you want to treat me to a meal, right? No need for the trouble, just go into the hospital for your internship, I still have other things to do, so I’ll be leaving.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen ran to the taxi parking spot near the hospital, got in a taxi and left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I…” Liu Qianqian looked at Ye Zichen, who had begun to disappear from her sight, in a stunned manner, and clenched her delicate fist. “Dad’s right, a forced deal isn’t good! Since you’re not going eat, I ain’t gonna treat you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, she turned angrily to leave. Yet, just as she turned around, she saw Deng Cheng look at her with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandpa!” Liu Qianqian ran over happily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Deng Cheng caressed her head with a warm smile, “You know Lil’ Ye?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He is my roommate’s boyfriend,” Liu Qianqian stuck out her tongue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Deng Cheng was momentarily stunned, but didn’t react all that much, “What do you think about Lil’ Ye?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen-ge, recently, you’ve been coming to the supermarket so frequently!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhuge Kongming sat properly behind the counter in order to watch over the shop. Seeing him, Ye Zichen rolled his eyes, then directly went down to the basement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Ye Zichen sent out another wave of goods, Yue Lao asked after receiving all the red packets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, ten percent off?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, ten percent off! Three hundred thousand cultivation experience, hurry up and send it over, I have urgent use!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao was one of the rich in the Heavenly Court currently, so it was elementary for him to buy several hundred thousand cultivation experience of goods.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received Yue Lao’s red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cultivation experience x300000</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, if there isn’t anything else, then I’ll be going…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go, go!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen directly went to the Treasure Shop after quitting the chat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Secret Scripture of the Fiery Eyes of Truth Level 1. Required cultivation experience: 1000000.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Exchange.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The current operation needs to deduct 1000000 cultivation experience, would you like to proceed?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You gained Secret Scripture of the Fiery Eyes of Truth Level 1 x1.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Withdraw.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Would you like to learn the Secret Scripture of the Fiery Eyes of Truth Level 1?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shooooo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A familiar feeling reached his eyes. Ye Zichen squinted his eyes, while his eyes gradually turned gold…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Too f*cking amazing!” Ye Zichen laughed loudly in the basement storage.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why did he go through so much trouble for so long?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It was just for this secret scripture!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen walked up from the basement joyously, and heard Zhuge Kongming make a call.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, I need to stock up here. Yes, yes, yes, these…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen slapped Zhuge Kongming’s head then rolled his eyes, “You’re sticking your nose into everything.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehehe, I’m just planning ahead, okay? We need to stock up every time Zichen-ge goes down into the basement!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Emotions arose in Ye Zichen’s heart as he looked at Zhuge Kongming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had thought about such a situation happening from the moment this little fellow had arrived.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he expected, this child has gradually begun to know his secret.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t go around telling people about this, actually, don’t tell anyone, okay?” Ye Zichen grabbed his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhuge Kongming instantly nodded like a chick pecking grains, “I definitely won’t tell others, even if my parents ask, I…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before he finished, a black Bentley stopped in front of the supermarket entrance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A beautiful lady, who looked to be around twenty something years old, wearing a green qipao [1.</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheongsam" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheongsam</span></a><span style>] and had her hair in a bun walked out. Her walking posture made her seem very ladylike.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Zhuge Kongming saw the woman, his expression tensed up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He quickly bent down, then hid behind Ye Zichen and whispered, “Zichen-ge, if she asks whether I’m here or not, tell her that I’m not!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, he ran up the stairs with an arched back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, a soft giggle sounded out in the room, “Kongming, you’ve played around for so long, it’s about time to go home, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The door to the supermarket was clearly locked from the inside, but the woman acted like it was nothing and directly passed through it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She still maintained the calm steps and the kind smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, both Ye Zichen and Zhuge Kongming gulped silently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is this person a ghost?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This was too f*cking miraculous, she actually passed over just like that.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Zhuge Kongming also licked his lips with a coy smile and revealed a surprised smile, “Mom, I’ve missed you so much.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Mom!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Mom!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at the woman in front of him in shock. </span><i><span style>It made more sense to call her an older sister.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Mom?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Did everyone from their place maintain themselves so well?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Since you miss me, then why didn’t you come to find mom when you ran from your dad’s place, and instead came here?” the woman didn’t even move her mouth when she spoke, but the sound rang out from all over the supermarket.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe…” Zhuge Kongming laughed dumbly. The woman pinched his cheek, then walked in front of Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hi Auntie,” Ye Zichen quickly bowed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Our family’s Kongming has truly troubled you,” The woman smiled. “However, our family is rather special, it is trouble for you for him to keep staying here. I have come here to take him away!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not leaving!” Zhuge Kongming frowned. “I don’t want to go back, Dad always makes me learn that crappy stuff, I don’t like it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is this something that you can decide, my cute son?” The woman’s voice sounded out from all over the place again. The tone was contained neither warmth nor anger, but it carried a feeling of undeniability.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but gulp once again.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Queen-like!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen-ge, I don’t want to go back,” Since he couldn’t make progress with his mother, Zhuge Kongming could only place his hopes on Ye Zichen. “If I return, I definitely won’t have anymore nice days.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kongming, stop messing around,” the woman raised her hand. Zhuge Kongming, who was hugging Ye Zichen closely flew backwards into the woman’s arms as if he was affected by a huge suction force.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, a jade ornament also appeared from the woman’s hand and was placed onto the cashier counter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Treat this as the payment for you taking care of my son recently. You can break this jade ornament in emergencies, I will hurry over to save you once!”</span></p>
