 <p><span style>Chapter 60 – I’m a ghost servant</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Impermanence raised his hand and hit White Impermanence hard on the head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop bullshitting, how could a mortal even see us?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Impermanence ignored his retarded woman and walked over towards Liu Qing with his huge chain, while putting on a kindly appearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little sister, do you want to get reincarnated to be human? Older brother is the Black Impermanence of the Underworld, I can take you to get reincarnated.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aren’t you just an intern!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The White Impermanence muttered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the ‘customer base’ of the Underworld had gradually increased, so did the number of ghost servants in the Underworld. For example, the Black and White Impermanence that had come to capture the deceased this time were the subordinates that the two Lord Impermanences of the Twelve Yin Generals had hired.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing blinked, and looked towards Ye Zichen, who was at the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since the two of them had been together for a long time, they did have a certain level of cooperation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing understood what to say just based on his looks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Black Impermanence-gege, is what you said true?” Liu Qing showed a look of really wanting to reincarnate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, as long as you come with us, I guarantee that you can get a good home.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>White Impermanence rubbed her head and walked over, however, her words a had a hint of threat to it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing did not care about the White Impermanence’s threat, she didn’t even think about leaving with the Black Impermanence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She merely asked for fun!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But…” Liu Qing hesitated for a moment. The Black Impermanence quickly spoke up, “But what?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t want to leave my boyfriend.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing immediately hugged Ye Zichen’s shoulder. Seeing that, the Black and White Impermanence revealed an understanding expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Normal ghosts would slowly forget about their experiences in the mortal realm, but a virgin ghost girl wouldn’t.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She would remember everything that had happened during her lifetime, and would stick to someone that was very important to her while she was alive.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Especially men…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The Black and White Impermanence’s chains were unable to chain up ghosts like Liu Qing that died before their time. This was the sole reason why they did not use force.</span></p>
 <p><span style>White Impermanence was happy that this pretty ghost hesitated but the Black Impermanence was annoyed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little sister, humans and ghosts are different. It’s impossible for you to be with your boyfriend. Also, you will hurt him by absorbing the yang aura from him if you stay at his side.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Black Impermanence advised with a caring voice. However, the White Impermanence said indifferently on the side, “I think that’s pretty good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Impermanence raised his hand to hit the White Impermanence once again in anger, even Ye Zichen couldn’t stand this sort of domestic violence anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He raised his hand and grabbed Black Impermanence’s arm and threw him to the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is your woman, she should be cared for by you with your life. She isn’t supposed to be hit by you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are-Are-Are you a human or a ghost?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s move completely stunned the Black and White Impermanence How could a mortal see them, much less grab him?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course laozi is human, when laozi’s yang aura is so strong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes towards Black Impermanence and walked towards White Impermanence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>White Impermanence was shocked. She stood in her place and looked at Black Impermanence, who fell onto the floor. For some reason, she wasn’t worried at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thinking about Black Impermanence’s actions of being a ghost servant throughout so many years.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two of them might truly have been married when they died, but they only had the name of a couple left now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go and chat with Liu Qing and Elder Su over there. You guys aren’t going to be able to take these two ghosts away.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>White Impermanence nodded, then walked towards Elder Su and Liu Qing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, when the White Impermanence spoke, she actually no longer screeched.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen didn’t notice this detail as he walked towards Black Impermanence with his hands on his waist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stay away from me, I am a ghost servant of the Underworld.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Impermanence raised his dry hand and pointed at Ye Zichen. Yet, his trembling tone revealed the terror buried in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>A mere mortal could actually see him, and even catch him…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t care if you’re a ghost servant or not. What? You can take me away?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his hand and slapped the Black Impermanence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Impermanence didn’t react, but Ye Zichen sucked in a breath of cold air and shook his hurting hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His face seemed to be made out of stone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Slap yourself!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen placed his hands behind his back and ordered Black Impermanence to act.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am a ghost servant.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ghost servant my ass, it doesn’t matter even if Yama comes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Impermanence clenched his teeth and slapped himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re pretty amazing when you can only bully a woman,” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows at Black Impermanence, who was on the floor. “Slap yourself two more times, you are the kind of people laozi dislikes the most.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t cross the line too much, I am a ghost servant.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you slapping or not? If you aren’t, then I’ll help you,” Ye Zichen glared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, Black Impermanence gulped, then slapped himself two more times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen finally nodded in satisfaction after seeing that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go and apologize to your woman.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t cross the line too much, I am a ghost servant.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you going or not?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Impermanence directly stood up, walked over in front of White Impermanence and gave a deep bow, “Sorry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Be more earnest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his foot to kick him. Black Impermanence looked backwards, but when he saw Ye Zichen glare at him with wide open eyes, he instantly shrank his neck and apologized to White Impermanence, “Sorry, I shouldn’t have hit you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Slap yourself two more times.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Impermanence perfectly carried out Ye Zichen’s request, then got thrown back into the corner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tell me, who told you to come and capture Elder Su?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Impermanence already lost all of the resistance that he had at the start. If Ye Zichen was a ghost, he might have opposed with force.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Ye Zichen was human…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ghost servants had regulations stating that they couldn’t make a move on living people without any orders. If they broke it, then they would be dispersed to nothingness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, this regulation was rather good, since mortals were unable to see ghosts, and ghosts were not allowed to make a move on people. This also ensured peace between the two realms.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>But f*ck, this guy can see ghosts.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s more, the guy could even catch him.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Hero, this little one was merely carrying out orders, it is unrelated to this little one.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was so terrified.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Impermanence’s submission was something that Ye Zichen did not expect, but he wasn’t the kind of person that liked to bully the weak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since the other person had submitted, he had no interest in bullying him anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m telling you, you can’t bring these two ghosts away.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Impermanence instantly cried, “Hero, we can choose to not bring that virgin ghost girl away, but we must bring the geezer away. His time is already up, the higherups sent us over to take care of him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’ll be alive later.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hero, stop kidding. Mortals have a set period of life, when it is used up, then it is over. What’s more, soul departure has already occured, even if you find a way to allow him to get more time to live, there’s no way for his soul to return to his body.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen thought for a moment, then pointed at Black Impermanence, “Squat here. See if I don’t beat you up if you dare to stand up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, yes, yes…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Impermanence squatted obediently in the corner, while Ye Zichen walked back over to the others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How is it? What did he say?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shook his head in reply, “Black Impermanence said that Elder Su’s time is up. However, from his words, there seems to be something that can increase the time someone has. But then he said something about soul departure…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Soul departure is the separation of the soul from the body,” White Impermanence spoke up with an older-sister-type voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then how can I return the soul to the body?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not sure, but the Heavenly Court…” White Impermanence paused, then said. “Sorry, I really want to help you, but regulations prohibit me from saying too much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What you have said already, it’s enough…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled. Everything was good when the Heavenly Court was mentioned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After all, he had the Heavenly Court’s WeChat group!</span></p>
