 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You have done acts of &nbsp;a great deed, and gained Reputation x14675.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Side Mission completed. Mission Reward: Reputation x1000.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Several notifications popped up on Ye Zichen’s phone. Not long later, Xiao Yumei pushed open the office door with a look of confusion on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aside from the cash flow, all of the company’s money has been transferred into a charity account. But why did you decide to donate all of the money so suddenly!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm, to earn some merits for myself,” Ye Zichen answered. He took a look at his reputation, which had already reached 15902.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He still didn’t quite know what was the use of reputation, but did know that both the system and Taibai Jinxing pestered him to earn more reputation!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei rolled her eyes speechlessly towards his reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she didn’t say anything else. Since her man wanted to donate it, then she immediately did so. She was sure that he had his own reasons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh yeah, I asked you to contact machinery producers etc. How’s that going?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ve already got the factories, and the equipment has been bought. But we are lacking on specialized staff. We didn’t manage to get many even though we asked head-hunting companies to hunt with a huge salary.” Xiao Yumei raised her eyebrows and replied. During the last few days, Ye Zichen had asked her to do all sorts of weird things, and to be honest, she was rather curious about the reason behind it… “What are you building factories for? Isn’t the medical company doing great?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can’t explain to you. Just take me to the factory first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Ye Zichen sat in the car, while Xiao Yumei drove them to the factory, he took out his phone and spammed his chat with Yue Lao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Recently, Yue Lao was also extremely busy, since Sky Sovereign suddenly told him to buy huge areas of land in the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had run around way too much for that in recent times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just when he finally bought most of the land in the Heavenly Court, and wanted to sit down to eat a bit of ice cream, the Sky Sovereign sent him another message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, this old man is here… What do you want to do now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you finish buying all the land in the Heavenly Court?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen asked with squinted eyes. Since the system continuously stressed that he only had the last seven days, he started to get worried as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Otherwise, he would not frantically busy the others as well. Although he still did not understand the true meaning behind the words of “the final seven days…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Time was short, and he had to hurry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“More or less,” Yue Lao wipe away the sweat from his forehead. “I already bought the places you according to your request of being far away from civilian area, and are surrounded by greenery.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good job,” Ye Zichen nodded, then licked his lips. “Go to the lands that you bought. I’m going to send a red packet for you later. The treasures within takes up a quite a bit of space.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, alright.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao replied speechlessly, then put his phone back into his pocket and licked the ice cream in his hands as he called over a cloud…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I’ll fly over!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen turned back towards Xiao Yumei after settling Yue Lao, “How long is it going to take till we get there?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t be in such a hurry. The factories are naturally in the rural areas, and we haven’t even left the city center,” Xiao Yumei answered speechlessly. </span><i><span style>My little man has really been in a huge hurry these past few days!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that so!” Ye Zichen muttered, then clicked open the system notifications on his phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The remaining time to complete the mission as merely 17 hours. </span><i><span style>I wonder just what is going to happen after these 17 hours.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Was has the system been stressing that it is the final seven days? Could I be killed if I don’t complete it?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It can’t be. If I was really going to be killed, then that should have been indicated as the punishment for failure.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But this mission had no failure punishment.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rubbed his temples tiredly, then leaned back in his seat as he looked in front of him with a frown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a good three hours, Ye Zichen and Xiao Yumei finally arrived at the factory area she mentioned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What entered Ye Zichen’s site was a huge industrial area, covering a very large space.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment the two of them got off the car, someone walked over to greet them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Director Xiao, Director Ye!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm,” Xiao Yumei nodded, then smiled towards Ye Zichen. “This is the place I chose for you. What do you think?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not bad!” Ye Zichen replied softly. “Are there any employees still inside?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, Boss Ye,” the man who greeted them nodded. “There are still approximately three thousand people including normal staff and technical personnel.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tell them to leave as quick as possible. Yumei, get Finance to give them half a year of salary…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, what now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both the man and Xiao Yumei were shocked.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>These are all people we found through so much trouble. Normal staff was one thing, but those technical personnel were grabbed over from other companies using very high salaries.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Didn’t he want to open factories? Why…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Listen to me. Tell them to all come out. Then leave immediately!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, then I’ll listen to you,” Xiao Yumei let out a sigh, then turned towards the man. “Supervisor Liu, sorry. Let our cooperation end here. Tell all the staff to withdraw. I’m very sorry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No worries, let’s continue cooperating next time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man didn’t say much, and merely walked into the broadcast room to shout a few words. Not long later, a huge plethora of people walked out of the factory…</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Xiao Yumei sent the staff away, she raised her eyebrows in confusion, “What kind of stuff do you want to do now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There isn’t anyone nearby, right?” Ye Zichen activated his Fiery Eyes of Truth and scanned his surroundings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei also looked around, then shook her head, “I don’t think there’s anyone else here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s great,” Ye Zichen nodded. Then he took out his phone. “No matter what you see later, don’t be too shocked!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Al-Alright!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Scan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Ye Zichen expected, the entire industrial area could be scanned and sent through a red packet like any other items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The system has detected that the item sent through the red packet is too large, so a service charge of 200000 cultivation will be required.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It was clearly the system that told me to build a factory in the Heavenly Court, and now it’s actually charging me a service charge for a red packet.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Confirm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoosh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The entire industrial area, which required ten-odd minutes to drive from one end to another, instantly disappeared in front of Xiao Yumei’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was already shocked beyond words when she saw that.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Was Zichen talking about this just now? How could anyone not be shocked? The industrial area disappeared just like that.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>More importantly, where did he move it to?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Even though she had been by Ye Zichen’s side for a long time, and thought highly of her acceptance ability, she was still very shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen was in no mood to mind so much, as he was already maniacally spamming Yue Lao’s chat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come out. Accept the red packet!”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Original Chapter Teaser:</strong>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Seven days? Huh? Why do I only have seven days? Or rather, what is the significance of it?</p>
 <p>The system clearly has a reason behind everything it does, but just damn it. Would it hurt to even explain it a little?</p>
 <p>Seven days... Argh, fine. I'll hurry up and complete the mission and get everything sorted in these seven days. Since the system emphasized on it, it must mean that something major is going to happen as well. I suppose I should go ahead and strengthen myself as much as possible as well. Seven days should be enough for me to reach the next level of cultivation...</p>
 <p>Only seven days remain... Why do I have a foreboding feeling in my heart?</p>
