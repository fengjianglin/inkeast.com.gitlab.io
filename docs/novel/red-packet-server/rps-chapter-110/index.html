 <p><span style>Chapter 110 – The Furious Taibai Jinxing</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re going to send them all of these stocks?” Liu Qing wandered around the storage, then was pretty much certain that he was going to send all of it after looking at Ye Zichen’s expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But aren’t you afraid of them not helping you after getting all these products!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen did have that sort of worry, if he was to send all of the products to them, it may affect the sales in the future.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Perhaps leaving some behind to advertise as new products in the future might better.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he already sent the price list over, so he couldn’t really not send all of it over. What’s more, he didn’t believe that this storeroom had all the snacks and drinks in the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for working or not…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see that your group name is called Supermarket Spokesperson Selection, you might as well just leave one agent behind. If you make them compete with each other, then at least some of them will work properly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re smart, little girl!” Ye Zichen raised his hand and knocked Liu Qing on the head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her idea truly worked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ll do as you said.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Scan!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen speedily sent all the items over, totaling to several hundred red packets, meaning that he sent several hundred types of products over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What he got in exchange was an empty storeroom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although his hands were sore from sending it, the others had their hands tired out from receiving it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His phone was instantly filled with notification of xxx received your red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your intimacy level with Yue Lao increased by 50. Current intimacy level: 230.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Intimacy level levelled up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Current intimacy level: Trusted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your intimacy level with Monkey increased by 50. Current intimacy level: 225.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Intimacy level levelled up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Current intimacy level: Trusted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s phone became filled with notifications of the intimacy levels increasing. In just a few moments, Ye Zichen’s intimacy level with the five deities in the group all became trusted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a while, the deities that snatched all the red packets started to speak in the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: Celestial friend, these… &lt;insert a row of astonished emojis&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha: Delicious… (It seems like he started to eat already)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: Hahaha, generous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Bro is generous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: Delicious… (This guy started to eat as well)</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as Ye Zichen had expected, the two people that he was worried about, Canopy Marshal and Third Prince Nezha, were truly people that caused others to worry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They really started to eat the moment they got it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, this was also a risk that Ye Zichen had to take. Although the two of them started to eat, the other three haven’t!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“These are free trial products for you guys. I hope you spokespeople will help this sovereign bring a lot of revenue. As long as you guys do well, then this sovereign would definitely give benefits to you guys! Another thing, these are the only products for free trial, which means that these are for you guys to open the market in the Heavenly Court, if you eat it…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: Eat it, then what?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha: You can’t eat it?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can eat it, just eat it if you want. But you guys wouldn’t be able to advertise in the Heavenly Court after that. Then you guys won’t be able to get discounts in the future. Oh yeah, there can only be one spokesperson in the end, it will be based on your sales results.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pursed his lips and continued when he saw the silent group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright everyone, the following time is on you guys.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stretched lazily after quitting the WeChat group. He looked at the empty storeroom and took out the phone number that Su Yiyun gave him to stock up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, hello, I want to import some stock!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, in the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nezha, who was wearing a golden armor and a red bellyband, with two buns on his head, put down the snacks in his hand with an expression of reluctance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can’t eat it,” Canopy Marshal did have some self-restraint, he stopped eating the moment he decided to. However out of the pile of snacks Ye Zichen sent over…</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed like only several bottles of drinks remained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha pouted in a troubled manner and looked at the pile of snacks beside him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eating another one doesn’t matter, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as he was about to open a jelly, the Immortality Peach Fairy flown over, “Third Prince…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Immortality Peach-jiejie.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Third Prince looked up happily. The Immortality Peach Fairy landed beside him and looked at the hill of snacks in front of him in confusion, “What are these?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Celestial Sovereign Nameless sent them do me. Do you want to try it, Immortality Peach-jiejie?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Third Prince handed a fruit jelly over, then thought of the message Ye Zichen sent in the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great deity Nameless needs cultivation experience. If Immortality Peach-jiejie wants to eat these snacks, then you can buy it from him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, at places around the South Heaven Gate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao took a different approach compared to Third Prince Nezha. He acted as an retailer.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>You can try it for free, but if you want to buy it, you have to go to him!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He would sell it for a price that was 10% more than the price on the price list Ye Zichen handed him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Erlang Shen and the Monkey King also started up. All of a sudden, the South Heaven Gate suddenly became a market place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen finished ordering the products, the sky had already turned dark. Thinking about Su Yiyun, who helped him out, Ye Zichen called him to Spring Bar, near the school.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two of them sat in a booth, while the table in front of them was covered with all sorts of drinks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun raised his glass and cheers with Ye Zichen before revealing a confused expression, “Zichen, my friend said you ordered products from him again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm, I sold all of the goods in the storeroom.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It was sold out?” Su Yiyun exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He ordered the first batch, and in order to save some effort for Ye Zichen, he ordered quite a bit of each product.</span></p>
 <p><span style>According to his predictions, it would last at least half a month in that sort of isolated place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen just told him that he was all sold out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In a mere afternoon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi, you aren’t kidding with me, right?” Su Yiyun gulped. No matter how long he hard he thought about it, he couldn’t think of a sales method to sell all of the stock in such a short time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It was given out for free. How could it not sell fast?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun was completely speechless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You gave it all out?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Riche.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun didn’t know what to think about him anymore. Those stock cost several tens of thousands yuan, he just gave it out like that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t get it. Just drink,” Ye Zichen touched Su Yiyun’s wine glass with his, then took out his phone to check Yue Lao and co.’s moments.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Out of them, Yue Lao was the most serious in it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He continuously advertised in his moments, and the frequency that he posted at was as fast as the WeChat shop owners that Ye Zichen had on his contacts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, he also replied to a lot of messages as well. It seemed like Yue Lao was going to be his commercial agent in the future.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for Nezha and co., the moments didn’t show much, so he didn’t know about their situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s phone vibrated, causing his shoulder to shake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Did a customer come so quickly?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen took a look with infinite excitement, only to find that it was Taibai Jinxing that had messaged him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little fellow, you’re challenging my bottom line.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed like Taibai Jinxing was angry!</span></p>
