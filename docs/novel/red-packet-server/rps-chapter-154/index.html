 <p><span style>Chapter 154 – The Great Sage wants to kill a Yao</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Xiyue, who had been a police officer for more than a year, had been faced with a case she’ll never forget in her entire life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A muscular man in a black vest held a stick and attacked a woman that looked to be around twenty five years old.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the interrogation, she found out that neither of them had any relationship problems, and only met for the first time that day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The muscular man continuously said that he wanted to kill a yao and was determined to use his stick to hit the woman…</span></p>
 <p><span style>For some strange reason, this scene reminded her of the scene in Journey to the West killing the White Bone Spirit [1.</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baigujing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baigujing</span></a><span style>] thrice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, the main reason was because this muscular man was determined in claiming that he was the Victorious Fighting Buddha, Sun Wukong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Could this person have a mental illness?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Xiyue held a gel pen with two fingers, and continuously stroked her long hair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man who was arrested for attacking the woman was sitting in the chair opposite her, and looked around the interrogation room curiously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sun Wukong, do you have any relatives?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I, Old Sun, have millions of monkeys…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Xiyue was about to go crazy due to him. “I, Old Sun”, “kill Yao”…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He really thought that he was Sun Wukong.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>She had seen people that went crazy from gambling, and people that went crazy due to stocks falling, it was her first time seeing someone that went crazy from watching Journey to the West.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tell me, what is your motive for hitting that woman?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I, Old Sun, told you ten thousand times, I’m eradicating a Yao!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Xiyue was speechless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She let out a long sigh, then slammed her notepad onto the table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From what she saw, the man in front of her was mentally ill, she’d just leave it to a mental institute.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for the victim, it’ll be up to Lin Xiyue herself to comfort her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little girl, where are you going? Help me, Old Sun, take the thingy on my hands off!” said the Great Sage as he shook the handcuffs on his hands, when he saw Lin Xiyue was about to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great Sage, wait here for a moment, I’ll be back soon,” Lin Xiyue patted the Great Sage’s shoulder, then opened the door to the interrogation room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment she closed the door, she saw Ye Zichen rush over with Third Fatty Jin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, why did you come?” Lin Xiyue felt really weird about him. If she said that they were friends, the issue was that she would get annoyed when she saw him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If she said that they were strangers, their relationship was much more complex than that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen licked his lips, glanced towards the interrogation room and spoke softly, “I came to bring that suspect away.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he said that, he pointed towards Great Sage, who was in the interrogation room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing Ye Zichen’s voice, the Great Sage immediately turned around, “Bro!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You know him?” Lin Xiyue raised his eyebrows in confusion. “Does he have… some sort of mental issues?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He bullshitted with you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, he kept on saying stuff like ‘I, Old Sun’ and ‘kill Yao’!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen knew that the Great Sage coming here was definitely trouble.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shrugged helplessly, then nodded, “Yeah, he has a multiple personality disorder. There are times where he always wants to be Sun Wukong!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, that’s right. When I asked him what his name was, he kept on saying that he’s Sun Wukong.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm, then he might be acting up again,” Ye Zichen sighed. There wasn’t any logical explanations in this situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh yeah, hurry up and let my friend go. I already met with the victim, and we decided to compensate in private. She should be coming over soon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem,” Lin Xiyue nodded, then walked into the interrogation room and unlocked the Great Sage’s handcuffs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment he was released, he immediately ran beside Ye Zichen and frowned, “Bro, you came too slowly. Also, this girl has continuously stopped me from killing the Yao, it’s really pissing me, Old Sun, off.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded towards Lin Xiyue with a smile, then dragged the Great Sage outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, at that moment, the victim walked over with two policemen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yaoguai, watch this!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Great Sage immediately wanted to ‘kill the yao’. Ye Zichen immediately held him by his waist, then signaled towards Third Fatty Jin, “What are you being stunned for? Why aren’t you coming over to help?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll treat you to a meal later.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shouted towards Lin Xiyue, then dragged the Great Sage from the interrogation room entrance, with one person holding his waist and one person holding his arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, why did you drag me, Old Sun, away? I, Old Sun, need to suppress the yao!” the Great Sage continued to say that he needed to defeat the yao after getting on the car.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes speechlessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She’s a proper human, why did you say that she’s a yaoguai?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How is she not a yaoguai?” the Great Sage swore confidently. “I, Old Sun’s, Fiery Eyes of Truth are not just for show, her original face is not the same with that one. What is it if it’s not a yaoguai possessing her..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hehe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing, who sat beside the Great Sage, suddenly giggled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Great Sage glared at her, “What are you laughing for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was completely speechless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He understood the Great Sage’s meaning, the Great Sage wanted to say that the woman had underwent plastic surgery.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In this era, plastic surgery was far too common.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great Sage, you don’t understand! These are all humans, they can’t change their appearance easily like deities! This method of changing their face is one of the technologies developed in this secret location. It can allow people to change into the appearance that they like. However, most of those people that change their faces are self-conscious of their looks…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s actually like that!” Great Sage Sun nodded like he understood. “No wonder I, Old Sun, did not feel her yao energy just now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Fatty Jin, who was driving, didn’t even dare to breathe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was finally certain that the lord in the backseat was Great Sage Sun, who had caused a havoc in the Heavenly Court. That’s someone on the level of his Esteemed Master…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t think that Ye Zichen could actually know someone of that level. It seemed like there was a reason for his shifu to order him to follow Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for Ye Zichen, who sat in the backseat, he was wondering about whether he should buy a house.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no other way around it, Great Sage Sun was definitely an unstable element.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Ye Zichen didn’t put the Great Sage beside him, god only knows what trouble the Great Sage would cause.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen opened his WeChat, and couldn’t help but frown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao, Nezha and co. were easily dealt with. They just wanted to stock up. Ye Zichen could just send the stuff over to them when he had time to go to the supermarket.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What troubled him more were the friend requests.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Han Xiangzi and Iron Crutch Li, four more friend requests came to Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lü Dongbin, Lan Caihe, Elder Zhang Guo and Cao Guojiu!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wow</span></i><span style>, aside from Immortal Lady He, pretty much all of the Eight Immortals had sought him out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These Eight Immortals were truly a bit relentless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at the friend requests.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Monkey Bro, who sat beside him looked over, “Aren’t those the Eight Immortals… Don’t you need the Nine Heart Lotus Root that’s in their hands!?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That’s true…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen licked his lips, he also knew that he needed to ask the Eight Immortals for the Nine Heart Lotus Root.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But them adding him…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was surely to flame him!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had already flamed Han Xiangzi to no end earlier, and now a few more people came.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed like he would only be able to deal with this by destroying the Eight Immortals.</span></p>
