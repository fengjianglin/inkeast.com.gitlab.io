 <p><span style>Chapter 734 – Foreign Call</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Ye,” a purple-robed man with mutton-jade-like skin slowly walked in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The deities took a glance…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Greetings to the Great Sacred Emperor Equaling Heaven.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shock surged through the minds of all the deities.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Even the mysterious lord of the Underworld came to the Heavenly Court in person!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Didn’t the rumors say that the Jade Emperor and the Great Sacred Emperor are on bad terms? Do Sky Sovereign's words mean that they are good again?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Zeze, say, it’s one thing for the Jade Emperor to be an idiot. Why are you wasting time with him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s not like I can’t not come when he sought me out,” the Great Sacred Emperor Equaling Heavens smiled wryly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who did you call an idiot? Say that again!?” Jade Emperor pointed at Ye Zichen, then turned to the Great Sacred Emperor Equaling Heaven. “What do you mean you couldn’t not come when I sought you out? You didn’t have to come. I didn’t force you to come with a knife by your throat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The deities started to leave silently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao yanked Yang Jian as he was leaving as well, “How long do you want to keep kneeling for? Let’s go!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Jade Emperor did not…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Screw off,” Jade Emperor told Yang Jian to scram as if chasing a fly away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>When only four people remained in the courtyard, the Jade Emperor glanced at the Flame Emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He came with you as well?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How could he not? Who knows whether the Jade Emperor will kill me in anger. I’m just taking necessary precautions,” Ye Zichen shrugged with a hint of meaningfulness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Jade Emperor’s expression drastically changed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, Ye Zichen glared back at the Jade Emperor, “You couldn’t actually be thinking of doing that…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahem,” the Jade Emperor coughed. The truth was that he was actually thinking of doing something.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He did not think about killing Ye Zichen, but rather, he was thinking of how to capture Ye Zichen and force the information of the ley line out of his prisoner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He would have naturally let Ye Zichen go after he managed to break through.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But now…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Great Sacred Emperor Equaling Heavens will definitely not allow him to capture Ye Zichen based on the former’s past relationship with Ye Zichen’s past life, when coupled with the Flame Emperor, he was not confident to take on both of them together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sensing the awkwardness, the Great Sacred Emperor Equaling Heavens quickly changed the topic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s talk about something else. I’m sure you know it already, so we won’t put on any acts. The Jade Emperor does have the ley line right now, but for some reason, the ley line seems to lost its effects completely. You told the Giant God that you can fix this, so can you come with us to take a look?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, sure. Of course I will since the Great Sacred Emperor asked.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So you wouldn’t have if it was me?” Jade Emperor snorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you think?” Ye Zichen twitched his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>During their walk, Ye Zichen remained behind the Jade Emperor.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Who knows what this geezer is thinking. If I walk in front, then what if he sneaks up on me!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Once again, Ye Zichen’s worries were spot on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the Jade Emperor did not expect Ye Zichen to be so smart as to permanently remain behind him, which forced him to give up the idea.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Approximately ten-odd minutes later, they finally arrived in a secret room in the Cloudy Palace of the Golden Arches.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ley line was randomly laid across a table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as if the ley line was dead. Even though the Jade Emperor did not do anything to suppress it, it didn’t even seem to try and escape.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jade Emperor, if I was strong enough, I really would have torn you apart.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clenched his fists when he saw the ley line.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“heh, just do your job.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Jade Emperor only cared about breaking through and ascending. He had no time to mind these baseless threats.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh,” Ye Zichen walked towards the ley line with a snort.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ley line, as legends around its name suggests, was like the veins of a dragon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While it normally did not have a physical form, it could actually take physical shape.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the ley line’s physical form seemed to have been completely devastated and its “blood vessels” already dimmed down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ve been through too much,” Ye Zichen slowly caressed the ley line.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ley line looked up. When it saw Ye Zichen, it let out a soft whimper.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry, I won’t let anybody hurt you anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can communicate with the ley line!?” Jade Emperor was shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the past two weeks, he tried his best to communicate with it, but it refused to answer. Due to that, he had assumed the ley line to be something that wasn’t actually living.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen ignored the Jade Emperor. He did not expect the Jade Emperor to be so fierce as to bring so much suffering to the ley line.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was not lying earlier. If he was truly strong enough.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He definitely would have made the Jade Emperor pay.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m talking to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Jade Emperor reached out towards Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, both the Flame Emperor and Great Sacred Emperor Equaling Heavens stepped forth and stopped him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Talk it out!” Great Sacred Emperor Equaling Heavens called out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you…” Jade Emperor frowned, then stared at the two in front of him. “You want to fight me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two did not deny it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fine. I do want to see whether the two of you have grown any stronger these years.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop it!” Ye Zichen turned his head back with a shout.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He nudged Flame Emperor to the side and frowned at the Jade Emperor. “If you want to ascend, then stay there properly. Otherwise, don’t even think about leaving the Three Realms in your lifetime.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you threatening me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What if I am?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two glared at each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The glares seemed to last for centuries until the Jade Emperor finally stopped releasing spiritual pressure and sat down on a chair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tch,” Ye Zichen clicked his tongue, then turned back towards the ley line.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Great Sacred Emperor Equaling Heavens followed him, “How is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He could tell that the situation was rather terrible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s harder to deal with than I thought,” Ye Zichen replied with a dark look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the phone in his pocket rang.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>A phone call?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen quickly took out his phone.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It really is a call.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>There’s phone signal in the Heavenly Court?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But it’s an Unknown Number…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Who is it?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Although countless questions raced through Ye Zichen’s mind, he still answered it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hello…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen could hear heavy breathing from the other side the call. Then… a seemingly familiar voice choked out, “Where are you, I’ll… go and find you! And… I’ve… missed you. Did you miss me?”</span></p>
