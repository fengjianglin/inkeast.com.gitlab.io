 <p><span style>Chapter 432 – Buy! Buy! Buy!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Treasure Shop!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Buy! Buy! Buy!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fiery Eyes of Truth, Body Freezing Technique…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen bought everything he could in the shop. Previously, Ye Zichen felt like the price of the treasures in the Treasure Store were way too much, since there were so many treasures that he could not use and could merely look at.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, he only felt…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hurry up and give me a mission to unlock level three. Otherwise, it’s too much of a shame if the cultivation is left here without being able to be used.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Would you like to purchase Fiery Eyes of Truth (Level 2)? This secret scripture will disappear after use.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Would you like to purchase Seventy-Two Transformations (Level 2)? This secret scripture will disappear after use.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Would you like to purchase Body Freezing Technique (Level 2)? This secret scripture will disappear after use.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes to everything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoosh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s body continuously shimmered with golden light, as if he turned on the special effects. An astronomical amount of information surged into Ye Zichen’s mind. He instantly smiled brightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Transform!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s phone fell onto the floor, and a buzzing fly appeared in the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hahaha, too amazing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fly laughed happily in the room, and called out silently in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Fiery Eyes of Truth, activate!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The room became transparent. The structure of the room was instantly revealed to Ye Zichen. He excitedly flew around the room, then, the scene in front of his eyes…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Snow white!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Huge!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ugh.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye ZIchen, who was transformed, instantly broke through the air and returned to human form. He covered his nose in fear of blood flowing out. Then, he looked up and saw Xuan-Yuan Xiang smile at him with a smile on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little brother, is big sis so nice to look at?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her smile was slightly threatening.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately walked to Tenner’s side and pretended like he didn’t know what was going on and picked up the toy bricks, “Tenner, having fun?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah!” Tenner nodded with a giggle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re guilty, and don’t dare to admit it even after daring to act? So what if you saw it? I don’t particularly mind.” Xuan-Yuan Xiang walked as she waved her fist. Although she always teased Ye Zichen, that was purely because she found it fun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Ye Zichen dared to take one step across the line, no, even half a step…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you want to do? I’m your master, and you still want to hit me?” Ye Zichen smiled with a shudder, then said slightly threateningly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master, since you said that, how could I hit you? I just want to caress you lovingly!” Xuan-Yuan Xiang walked over with a giggle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen gulped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Freeze!” Xuan-Yuan Xiang, who was walking over, instantly froze on the spot. At that moment, Ye Zichen also put his hands on his waist and walked in front of her with pride. “Come, hit me! What a joke, I would get bullied by you? C’mon, my face is right here, try and hit me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was filled with joy as he showed off.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Having cultivation experience is good. Getting so much cultivation experience from Taibai Jinxing is great. If it wasn’t for these gifted cultivation experience, then I wouldn’t be able to buy so many secret scriptures, nor would I be able to show off using the Body Freezing Technique.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>What he did not notice was that as he was focusing on showing off, Xuan-Yuan Xiang, who was stuck in the spot, suddenly smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She immediately slapped him, causing him to be shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked at Xuan-Yuan Xiang, who was smiling at him, in shock…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, no, didn’t you get frozen on the spot? Then why can you still move?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know. Why do you think? Zeze, who was getting all cocky in front of me just now and told me to hit him? Since you requested that of me, then I could only satisfy you!” Xuan-Yuan Xiang smiled kindly and raised her right fist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A huge noise instantly sounded out in the Ye mansion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei and Tiantian hurried over in less than one minute and pushed open the bedroom door. The moment they entered, they saw Ye Zichen fall on the ground with his face up and his arms and legs spread out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen,” Xiao Yumei frantically ran over, and while she did so, she accidentally knocked over Tenner’s toy bricks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Meanie!” Tenner stood up and looked at Xiao Yumei with a pout.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen hurriedly looked towards him. Both Xuan-Yuan Xiang and Tenner were artifact spirits, so Xiao Yumei were unable to see them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, are you alright?” Xiao Yumei helped Ye Zichen up form the ground nervously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shook his head and smiled, then glared at Xuan-Yuan Xiang before he replied, “I’m fine, I just fell.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why were you so careless? You scared me to death just now,” Xiao Yumei knitted her eyebrows and pouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stood up coyly, then glared towards Xuan-Yuan Xiang once again, then smiled, “Alright, stop worrying. Let’s go out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm,” Xiao Yumei nodded warmly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before they left, Tiantian blinked her bright eyes and looked over the room one last time, before she skipped after Ye Zichen and Xiao Yumei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they got downstairs, Mother Ye also asked them what had happened. After Ye Zichen explained it to her with a soft smile, Xiao Yumei and her begun to prepare the food in the kitchen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a good amount of contact, the relationship between Mother Ye and Xiao Yumei already became the relationship of a mother-in-law and the daughter-in-law.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Tiantian sat on Ye Zichen’s lap, while her eyes were filled with curiosity, “Daddy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows with a smile then caressed her hair. “What is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, nothing!” Tiantian giggled. Then, she jumped down from his lap and ran in front of the television to grab the gaming controller, then ran back again. “Play.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After playing games with Tiantian in the living room for half an hour, Ye Zichen took out his phone to have a look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Plenty of deities still entered the Red Packet Server. What was originally a group with a single digit number of people, now had nearly a hundred members.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for the messages in the group, all of them asked Taibai Jinxing why he left the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Seriously, this geezer… He invited all these people here, but then god knows where he went.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen retorted silently in his heart. At that very moment, his heart rang out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little friend, this sovereign is about to descend. The location will be at XXX. Can you please come and get me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately replied. Then after checking the time, he immediately took a jacket from the closet and ran out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, the food’s nearly done.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not going to eat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This child…” Mother Ye shook her head, then returned to the kitchen and smiled helplessly at Xiao Yumei. “It seems like only us three are left again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei merely smiled warmly. She was already used to that sort of situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, after Tiantian saw Ye Zichen leave, she pouted, then threw the controller onto the ground, then quickly ran up to the second floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She tiptoed and grabbed the room’s handle…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then pushed open the door and entered.</span></p>
