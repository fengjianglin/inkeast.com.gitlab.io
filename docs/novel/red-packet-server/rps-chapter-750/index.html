 <p><span style>Chapter 750 – Prophecy</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cui Twelve nearly could not believe his words.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>His Majesty is…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Injured?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The Four Directional Palace was in the center of the God Realm’s nine regions. Part of the reason they were considered one of the strongest was their geographical location, but the main reason was Bi’an.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why did the powerful demons not dare to attack the God Realm? Why did the Liches who were beyond the Three Realms so wary of those of the Four Directional Palace?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bi’an’s position as one of the strongest in the God Realm was no joke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, such a powerful person was coughing up blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite that, Cui Twelve realized he had misspoken the moment the words left his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He felt a sharp gaze look over. At that very instant, he shuddered as if he was trapped in a glacier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cui Twelve dropped to his knees without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty, I saw nothing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had no choice but to ask for mercy even if he was a “Highness” in the Four Directional Palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was superior to the vast majority and only stood below one person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But he understood that his life did not belong to him. Bi’an only needed to say it to take his life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Or rather, Bi’an only needed to think that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Time slowly ticked away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cui Twelve’s sweat began to drip to the ground. His heart raced in uneasiness.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why did I say that!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Twelve.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a seemed like a lifetime, Bi’an called out slightly indifferently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cui Twelve looked up frantically and saw that Bi’an had walked in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The intense pressure almost made his heart stop. He was suffocating, but he still held on to that glimmer of hope, “Present.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have been with me for nearly a hundred years, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Honestly speaking, the reason you became a Highness in the Four Directional Palace was because I had faith in you. You are proficient in the art of prophecy and the only person who is proficient in that art is the one in the far north. He is also the one who has made our position at the center rather awkward. The ones in the far north are no weaker than us,” Bi’an’s gaze never left Cui Twelve’s eyes, causing Cui Twelve to lose his ability to think. “But over the years, you have only given me more and more disappointment. However, I will give you a chance… If you can foretell whether I will kill you or leave you alive, then I shall leave you alive.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cui Twelve couldn’t answer that paradoxical question.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>His Majesty already gave me the answer in his words. But… will I really foretell myself as being left alive?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>No.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He took several deep breaths in an attempt to calm himself down. Then, Cui Twelve’s body began to emit a holy light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Indeed, he was foretelling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was foretelling with everything he had.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Countless possibilities flashed through his mind and soon, his eyes and ears started to bleed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He did have a talent for prophecy, but foretelling his own future was difficult enough, while Bi’an’s involvement only made it more so. He was unable to do it with his current strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Bi’an waited silently for Cui Twelve’s answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment, an elder holding a book appeared behind Cui Twelve. The sight of the elder made Bi’an smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have an answer?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You will kill me, but you will revive me, then let the god avatar beneath this hall take over my body.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can leave now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty, do I still need to take the poison half a day later?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you think?” Bi’an answered indifferently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The subdimension continued to collapse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stared at the speed of the subdimension collapsing. He did not want to believe that anything happened to the white-robed man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wanted to determine whether the white-robed man was still alive or not through the speed in which the subdimension was collapsing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But the results were dire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Ye, what do you think…” Flame Emperor was uncertain, so he set his gaze upon Ye Zichen. No matter what, the white-robed man was closest to Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did we evacuate everyone from the subdimension?” Ye Zichen did not answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes,” City Lord Lin of the Hundred Flowers City answered. “There weren’t many people left inside, so we all came out the moment the collapse began. But we still have a lot of resources within.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t think there’s any point of worrying about the resources is there? If the subdimension shatters, then they’ll all fall down, but since we haven’t seen the resources, then the subdimension must have self-destructed. I’m sure you all understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s expression darkened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t want to talk about it was to prevent others from noticing, but…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He glared at Zhao Zizhao. </span><i><span style>He’s here too.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just what is he trying to do?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He gazed at Zhao Zizhao coldly. Noticing Ye Zichen’s gaze, everyone else looked towards the two.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Emperor Ye, Zizhao doesn’t mean anything bad by it. He is just blunt with what he says.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Xihe’s relationship with Zhao Zizhao has been improving greatly during the past six months and women in love were true fools.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only she would speak up for Zhao Zizhao in such a situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hah,” Ye Zichen laughed meaningfully. “I have to be honest with everyone. If the subdimension self-destructs, then everything within will be destroyed. But.. this doesn’t mean that its creator died, he might just be severely injured, so he had to withdraw the spiritual energy for recovery. I’m sure all of you understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Emperor Ye, you are making a mistake.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s smile brightened when Zhao Zizhao spoke up once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shut it, I know what you want to say. If the master of the subdimension needs to withdraw the spiritual energy to recovery and let the subdimension self-destruct, then it won’t be able to fully recover, right? I let you off just now because City Lord Lin said that you’re a blunt and open person, but now… Why are you focusing on the situation of the subdimension’s master?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m just talking about facts, what’s wrong with that!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zizhao!” Lin Xihe called out with a frown and pulled Zhao Zizhao’s hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re acting tough,” Ye Zichen pursed his lips, then looked at Zhao Zizhao meaningfully. “Did something get to you? You’re going to reveal yourself now?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Aren’t you in too much of a rush?”</span></p>
