 <p><span style>Chapter 312 – The Undefended Dog Food</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I seriously don’t know where these idiots came from. They actually came to hijack a plane without bringing anyone capable of piloting one.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Do they really think that planes can fly on autopilot the entire way without manual control?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>This isn’t a drone, which is fine with a preset program and is not afraid of accidents.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Ye Zichen’s kick completely shocked the scar-faced man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He stood up and patted his butt, “You dared to hit meh. Brothers, beat ‘im up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the hijackers in the cabin rushed over, while Ye Zichen cracked his neck…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang bang bang bang bang!</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of these hijackers fell to the floor with just a few kicks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you don’t want to get beaten up, then squat there. If anyone dares to move, then I’ll beat you to death!” Ye Zichen glared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, there were naturally individuals amongst the criminals with a bad temper. Just as that individual wanted to stand up, scar-face immediately stopped him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Idiot, don’t go over. We can’t beat him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The individual thought about it, and found truth in scar-face’s words, so he didn’t rush up and instead squatted down obediently beside his comrades.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fellow passengers. In order to ensure your safety, I’ll be leaving these criminals to you guys. If they dare to move, then use the power of the crowd to beat them. I have to hurry over to the cockpit. Otherwise, we’re all screwed!” Ye Zichen shouted towards the passengers in the cabin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The passengers nodded in response.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They understood that the criminals were actually just pretending and had used fake guns to scare them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry up, we’re here already!” Several male passengers shouted out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded in response and ran towards the cockpit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The door of the cockpit was standing open, and when he entered he saw a criminal playing on his phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The criminal was clearly of a slightly higher-level compared to the others. At least, he was in terms of vigilance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he turned around and saw Ye Zichen at the entrance, he raised his eyebrows…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re a passenger, right? You can’t enter, the bathroom is on the right. Go!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Although he was vigilant enough, his intelligence was still pitiful.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen grabbed his collar, pushed him to the ground, stepped on him, then took a glance at the terrified pilot and copilot in the corner of the cockpit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Find a place to land, I’ve already suppressed the criminals in the cabin.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay, okay, okay,” neither the pilot nor copilot noticed that the criminals were speechlessly lacking in intelligence, so they looked at Ye Zichen gratefully before returning to their positions and requested commands from air traffic control.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen picked the criminal up and chucked him beside the bunch of criminals in the main cabin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened with you guys? Why are you all squatting here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can’t you tell? We got beaten up,” the scar-face man cursed in annoyance. “I told you we should have stayed at home and farmed, but you insisted on taking on this big job and do something great. That’s great, we’ve completely failed!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It doesn’t matter. Isn’t it possible for crops to wilt? We’ll just treat it as our crops wilting. When we get off the plane, we’ll just go and apologize properly to our wives. It’s no big deal!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen wasn’t the only one speechless. Everyone who heard what the man said was dumbfounded.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Do they really don’t know about laws? They actually think that they can go home after getting off the plane…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen did not want to tell them the truth. People take desperate measures when they’re pushed against into a corner. If he was to tell them that they would be taken away by the police after landing, they might crazily retaliate, causing the passengers in the cabin to be endangered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen glared at the criminals, then returned to his seat to sit down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you,” the one who spoke up was the cold lady. Ye Zichen glanced at all, and noticed that the woman had kept a plain demeanor the entire time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her face was calm even when people did not notice the criminals’ lack of intelligence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, what surprised Ye Zichen were her words of thanks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, Xiaohua, I was the one who saved you from the abyss. I’m truly depressed that you actually thanked him. Could this world be one that looks at faces?” The fatty squatted on the floor and complained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The lady immediately snorted coldly, “I’ll say it again. I’m not called Xiaohua, I’m called Hua Zhiru! Also, as for the… harassment against me just now, I will send you a letter from my lawyer after returning to the capital. Fatty Yin, don’t think that I don’t dare to do anything to you just because you got a few shits in your family.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Ye Zichen realized that the girl and the fatty seemed to know each other!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaohua, this is where you are wrong. Why am I, your Yin-ge, on this plane? Isn’t it to protect you? Didn’t I already tell you not to get on this flight during boarding because it was dangerous? You just refused to listen!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehehe… A hundred and ten percent of what you say is false. Do you think I would believe you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But didn’t you get into danger?” the fatty raised his eyebrows with a smile. “This is my seventh time saving you. Even if you were ice, you should have been melted by my fire. Why are you still like this to me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Like what?” Hua Zhiru twitched her mouth. “Don’t try to get with me from now on. Didn’t your parents set up a marriage target for you? It’s that girl from the Qi family… Also, it wasn’t you who saved me this time, it was this guy beside me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s my bro!” the fatty hooked his arm around Ye Zichen’s shoulder and said in a familiar tone. “If he wasn’t my bro, do you think he would have saved you? As for the girl from the Qi family, I can only chuckle…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fatty’s expression suddenly darkened, “That woman… Has so many lovers outside, but she still f*cking pretends to be a tender little girl in front of my parents. I really want to ignore her!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s your fault. You were the one who loved her to no end before!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was young and naïve…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then don’t try to get with me now. I get annoyed just from looking at you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the two spoke, they begun to argue once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen became completely astounded, “Err… Can you mind the others around you when you flirt? You truly caught me off-guard with all the dog food!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who’s flirting with him!” Hua Zhiru glared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, the fatty chuckled on the side, “Naturally, that would be you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck off…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the plane finally landed, the criminals were taken away by the police to nobody’s surprise, while Ye Zichen and the others were also taken back to the station to make a statement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Originally, the police had wanted to reward him for his actions, but since Ye Zichen was in a rush, he refused it with a smile, then took the quickest flight to the capital.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What made him rather shocked was that the fatty and Hua Zhiru also went with him…</span></p>
 <p><span style>What made him even more amazed was that his seat was right in the middle of theirs, and they argued for the entire journey.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Seriously, the dog food…” Ye Zichen sighed. He truly regretted not buying any earplugs before boarding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, it was fortunate that it did not take long for the flight to land.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The capital…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I’ve arrived!</span></i></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Original Chapter Teaser:</b>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p><strong>Scar-face:&nbsp;</strong>How dare you hit me!?</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>That was just an accident...</p>
 <p><strong>Scar-face:&nbsp;</strong>Accident!? Do you think laozi is stupid? We...</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Ugh, here we go again. I really just wanted to get to the capital in peace. First the loudmouth fatty, and now this... Why am I so unfortunate!?</p>
 <p><em>One minute later.</em></p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Alright now. All of you put all your weapons onto the floor and kick them to the side. Then, squat down like some good kids.</p>
 <p><strong>Hijacker A:&nbsp;</strong>Argh, laozi will kill you.</p>
 <p><em>Ye Zichen smacks Hijacker A.</em></p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Now now, be a good kid and stay put if you don't want to die.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>EVERYONE, I'll be leaving these hijackers in your hands. Use your combined power to knock them out if you have to. I'll be going over to the cockpit to take a look.</p>
