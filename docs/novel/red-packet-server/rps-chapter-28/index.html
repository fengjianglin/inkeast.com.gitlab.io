 <p><span style>Chapter 28 – Deconstruction Incident</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ten days later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It could be said that Ye Zichen was completely immersed in his own little world due to studying that Unbreakable Body, even though he wished to stop, he couldn’t.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The secret scripture that Erlang Shen had sent him was Level 1 of Unbreakable Body. It could pretty much stop knives, lances and sticks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it couldn’t really do much against hot weapons, such as firearms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Basically, this Unbreakable Body was a layer of protective qi, and it could be released and retracted whenever he wanted to. You would release it when you wanted to use it, and retract it when you didn’t.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In one word.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Convenient!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi, what are you doing on the weekend? How about going out with me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun leaned on his expensive Ferrari and raised his eyebrows towards Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No time, I have to go home and bring my mom over here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before he had even finished, Ye Zichen’s phone rang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The caller ID was Auntie. Actually, this Auntie wasn’t his relative, it was a neighbor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she has always helped out his home a lot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Auntie.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled slightly, then very quickly turned somber.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, I understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slam.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He hung up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the call had ended, Ye Zichen’s expression was terrifyingly dark.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi, what happened?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi, what exactly is going on?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun was very worried as he looked at Ye Zichen’s dark expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen remained silent, but his clenched fists did not relax one bit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ol’ Three, take me back home.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s home was in a small village outside of Bingcheng. Due to the development of the rural areas, the surrounding villages and areas were gradually being bought by the developers and being deconstructed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Several tens of people surrounded a fallen building. Most of these people were villagers of the village.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most of them held stuff like shovels and pickaxes in their hands. Opposite them, there were also ten odd men in black vests, holding sticks in their hands, standing with the developers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mom…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just at this moment, a voice rang out from the crowd.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The surrounding villagers and the people with the developers looked over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t that the child from Lil’ Ye’s family?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many of the villagers recognized him. At the same time, a woman walked out from beside the debris.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the woman dressed simply, she had an aura around her, and her smile was extremely intimate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was Ye Zichen’s mother, Ye Rong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, why did you come back?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Rong’s voice was mixed with a surprise that was hard to hide. Ye Zichen quickly ran over to her side and checked her thoroughly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mom, are you alright!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m fine, when the developers knocked down the building, mom was with your auntie.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Rong had a smile on her face, as if her mood was not affected by the forceful deconstruction of her home at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at that debris and felt a sense of relief.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>If his mom was truly in there at the time…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Thinking about how close danger was to his mom, Ye Zichen was unable to suppress the fires raging in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He quickly walked in front of the villagers and looked at the developers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who’s in charge here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A man about thirty years old walked out from within the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you know how dangerous forced deconstruction is? What if there was someone inside?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So what if there’s a person in there? I’m telling you, it would be better if someone was in there. If one died, then just treat it as us making an example of him. It’s just a life, it’s not like we can’t afford to compensate for it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The developer leader’s voice was full of disdain. Hearing that, all of the villagers revealed an expression of rage. Ye Zichen’s gaze also instantly turned cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clenched his fists forcefully, then stared closely at that developer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Say that again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brat, don’t get pretentious here. I’m telling you, if someone died from the forced deconstruction, then so be it, if he did, then he just got lucky.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Smack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen threw a card onto the developer’s leader’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s five million in that card.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you want do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?” A cold light flashed across Ye Zichen’s eyes. “I’m buying your life.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brat, you are f*cking looking for death, right?” The developer’s leader roared and shouted at the fighters behind him. “Teach him a lesson for me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What, are you letting me sleep?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, a young man with a cigarette in his mouth walked down besides the black business car.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man walked towards Ye Zichen with a frown. The developer’s leader immediately smiled and apologized.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Huang, someone wants to cause trouble.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who dares to cause trouble on my turf,” The young man looked up with a frown. When he saw Ye Zichen…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young-Young Master Ye.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is your project, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young-Young Master Ye, it’s all a misunderstanding. It really is only a misunderstanding.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man in front of him was Xiao Hai’s cousin, Huang Ming. This project actually wasn’t theirs, he just came here to try and get in on it, and to see if he could get something out of it with using his cousin’s name.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Misunderstanding?” Ye Zichen suddenly laughed. “You’re standing here, and you’re telling me it’s all a misunderstanding?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Huang…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Huang your mom, hurry up and apologize to Young Master Ye.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Ming slapped the developer’s face and yelled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The developer leader immediately cleared up with Huang Ming’s slap. It was clear to him that even Huang Ming couldn’t afford to piss the young man in front of him off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Ye, it’s myself that have eyes that can’t recognize Mt. Tai…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop it, I don’t want to hear that much,” Ye Zichen pointed to the card on the ground. “This card is the card used to buy your life. Enjoy it before I find you. I will come to take it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As for you…” Ye Zichen pointed towards Huang Ming. “I will deal with you, but not now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Ye, this really is a misunderstanding, please let me explain,” Huang Ming begged, while his forehead and back became covered with sweat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Ye, Young Master Ye…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, you can’t really be…” Hearing that Ye Zichen said he was going to buy the developer’s life, Ye Rong felt rather afraid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m just scaring him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You child…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Rong’s expression was full of blame, but not too much reproach.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled at her, then glanced at the developer on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“These sorts of people need to be scared.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Rong shook her head with a helpless expression. Ye Zichen chuckled, then held her hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mom, since our home has been taken down, come to live near me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s alright,” Ye Rong looked helplessly at the pile of debris. It was indeed not possible to continue living there. “But the cost of living is rather high there. We haven’t signed a contract with the developers, what if they don’t give us money after we leave?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He doesn’t dare to not give us the money, am I right, Young Master Huang…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen glanced at Huang Ming with a cold laugh. When Huang Ming felt this gaze, he felt cold sweat drip down over his body, causing him to continuously nod.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, yes, yes, we will definitely pay the money.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then thank you, Young Master Huang.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Huang, save me,” When Ye Zichen and Ye Rong left from the crowd, the developer’s leader, grabbed Huang Ming’s hand tightly. Huang Ming kicked him away immediately, “Save your ass, laozi is finding it hard to even save myself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He took out his phone tremblingly and spoke into it with a worried expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Biaoge, I seem to have gotten into trouble.”</span></p>
