 <p><span style>Chapter 48 – Liu Qing’s strangeness</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had a naughty smile as he stared into Officer Lin’s eye without avoiding her gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, a hint of skin attracted his vision. He subconsciously looked down…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To be honest, Officer Lin’s slap didn’t hurt Ye Zichen at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He touched his cheeks, then returned onto the chair and crossed his legs, while he raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It wasn’t intentional, it was a pure subconscious reaction. To be fair, it’s your fault, since it’s an interrogation, why didn’t you button up your collar?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You what? Don’t you know that I’m still a university student, and am in the middle of the innocent puberty? Isn’t this clearly forcing me to commit a crime?” Ye Zichen retorted. Then, a naughty smile surfaced on his face. “I get it now, no wonder you come back yourself every time you interrogate me and shut the door so tightly. Do you have ill intentions towards me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shao Yang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Officer Lin was so angry due to Ye Zichen that her lips turned pale, thus, she roared towards outside the door. Not long later, the door to the interrogation room was pushed open and an officer ran in frantically.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Take him away.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shao Yang glanced at Ye Zichen, who crossed his legs like he didn’t care, and placed the phone in his hand onto Officer Lin’s table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Captain, take the call first. Our chief called.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Officer Lin’s expression changed. Last time, Ye Zichen had managed to leave just because she took the call!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This time, he took way too much advantage of her, if she lets him leave…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Lin!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A voice from the phone sounded out. Officer Lin bit her lips, then glared at Ye Zichen fiercely before listening to the call.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, in my hands!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He hurt a person in front of me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, I understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slam.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a few simple conversations, Officer Lin furiously hung up and walked in front of Ye Zichen front the interrogation desk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can leave now, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled, then unrulily stretched in front of Officer Lin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A piercing cold light filled Officer Lin as she said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re pretty amazing, there’s always someone to help you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How do you know whether I’m amazing? You’ve never tried it,” Ye Zichen smiled playfully, causing Officer Lin to raise her hand in an attempt to hit him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, a police officer can’t hit people,” Ye Zichen raised his hands to stop Officer Lin’s action, then walked out of the door with his eyebrows raised.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right when he was about to go out of the door, he suddenly stopped, swept his gaze over Officer Lin’s body, before finally stopping at the place that stood out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t just develop there, develop your brain as well!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The, he turned around and waved towards Officer Lin, before leaving the interrogation room at a moderate pace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Officer Lin, who was standing within the interrogation room, clenched her fist. The officer behind shrunk his neck when he saw this and quickly ran out from the interrogation room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, I have truly remembered you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen walked out of the interrogation room, he saw Su Yan waiting outside the entrance to the police station.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Su and the guard company were also beside her. At the same time, there was also a square-faced man that he has never seen before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man was expressionless, and clearly not a person that was good at speaking. Ye Zichen felt a very uncomfortable chilling aura from him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Ye, they didn’t trouble you, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Su was the first to walk up to him, while Su Yan’s expression also relaxed slightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only the square-faced man was still looking at him using a judging gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who is this person?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen twitched his mouth and commented silently, but he still chuckled casually on the surface.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How would they dare to do anything to me? It’s pretty good when I don’t do anything to them!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, it’s great they you’re fine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Su Yan looked at the expression of the square-faced man a few times, she stepped forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your affability level with Su Yan increased by 100. Current affability level: 150.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although a hero saving a beauty was cliché, it was this sort of cliché plot that was able to capture the hearts of countless beauties.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan was no exception.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Ye Zichen stood up for her, she felt that all of his negative points before turned good.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, right? Thank you for helping my daughter, Su Yan, and my father.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, that square-faced man, who hadn’t said a word till now, spoke up. However, Ye Zichen was unable to feel that he was being thanked from the tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, Ye Zichen did find something else out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This guy was Su Yan’s father!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen felt a bit frantic meeting with his father-in-law so soon!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled embarrassedly, scratched his head and replied humbly, “It’s no big deal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan’s father did not say anything else to him. He merely reached out his hand to call the car over and signaled Su Yan and Old Man Su to get in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dad, I want to go back to school!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Get in the car!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no doubt in Su Yan’s father’s voice. Su Yan bit her lips, then after hesitating for a brief moment, she walked into the car without saying anything against him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, take care.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan rolled down the window and shouted towards Ye Zichen right before the car left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled with a nod, and waved towards Su Yan. However, he smiled wryly in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That father-in-law seemed hard to deal with!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Zeze, it seems like your girlfriend’s dad doesn’t think much of you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing floated down from the sky and smiled playfully. Ye Zichen rolled his eyes at her, then took out his phone to dial Chief Liu’s number.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he did not notice that when he flipped to Chief Liu’s number, the expression of Liu Qing, who was in midair, suddenly changed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you, Liu-ge.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen already sent a message to Chief Liu before arriving at the police department.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was clear that Chief Liu had did something behind the scenes for him to escape the demonic claws of Officer Lin so quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Welcome, this is a small issue. Even if I didn’t do anything, you would still be fine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clearly knew that Chief Liu was talking about Elder Su, but since Chief Liu had helped, he still needed to thank him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Still, thank you, Liu-ge.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t be so courteous with Liu-ge. Oh yeah, Liu-ge has a small request.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come over to Liu-ge’s home when you have time. My wife has some troubles, and recently her body isn’t so great, so I wanted to ask you to come and have a look.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Chief Liu ended the call, Ye Zichen returned the phone to his pocket.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he lifted his head, he saw that Liu Qing’s expression as very weird.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, what are you thinking about?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Liu Qing shuddered, and replied with an natural smile on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothing, who were you calling just now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A friend, he’s kind of an old bro,” Ye Zichen chuckled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what did you guys talk about?” After saying this, Liu Qing’s eyes flashed with a clear interest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just a few simple words, and I thanked him. The old bro told me that his wife’s condition isn’t so good, then asked me to go and have a look when I have time,” Ye Zichen didn’t think so much into it. He merely told her about the contents of the call. When he finished speaking, he raised his eyebrows, “I’ve never seen you get so interested before, why are you so mindful of it this time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothing, nothing. Then go and have a look sooner rather than later. No matter what, Chief Liu helped you out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ll see when we have time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shrugged. He doesn’t possess any medical skills, nor is he a psychologist. He only saves people purely with the Great Recovery Pills he has.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang doesn’t appear often. The Great Recovery Pills were all from the salaries of the heavenly soldiers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A day in heaven was a year on earth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God knows when Old Lord Taishang will give out Great Recovery Pills again, and Ye Zichen still had to save some for him and his mother in case of emergencies!</span></p>
