 <p><span style>Gulp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was completely dumbfounded. </span><i><span style>Is the system telling me that he’s coming to see me?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re coming?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: Kind of. I might not see you though, it’ll all depend on how I feel. Alright, stay there and don’t move, I’m breaking through the formations right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, the system notifications gradually disappeared. </span><i><span style>I guess he’s not interested in chatting with me anymore.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Even so, Ye Zichen couldn’t help but be stunned by the news…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The person breaking the formations outside is him, the system!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rubbed his nose, then returned his phone to his pocket before walking beside the two black-robed people. The two of them did not show any hints of wanting to hurry Ye Zichen along. They merely sat quietly in different places without making a sound.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uhm, how about we not go out? What do you guys think?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay,” the two nodded together. </span><i><span style>The system really was right! They really didn’t refuse.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait, didn’t you two come here for treasures? You really agree to not going anywhere?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two people merely nodded softly once again, then proceeded to get lost in their own worlds.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This is so strange! </span></i><span style>Ye Zichen scratched his head as he looked at the two black robed people who had their backs to him. </span><i><span style>What’s up with them?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>They spent so much effort to get to Mount Supreme, and it wasn’t for any treasures? Could they just be here for fun?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But since they don’t want to do anything, then I guess that’s alright…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior!” Su Liu’er couldn’t help but speak up for her little sister, even though she didn’t dare to go against the person who was breaking the formation, when she saw that person went to play with his phone. “Are… you going to break through the formations?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Liu’er-jie, it’s hard to imagine you actually speaking to me like that. You were really fierce back then,” the man smiled plainly with a hint of wryness. “I kneeled in front of the gate of the Fox Yao’s mountain for a month, but you still didn’t even do so much as go to look at me.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>How’s that possible!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Su Liu’er’s eyes were filled with shock. Although she </span><i><span style>was</span></i><span style> rather cold, and didn’t look at most people properly, it was impossible for her to ignore an expert of a senior like the one in front of her for a month, while he kneeled in front of her household.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s more, I don’t even remember that happening.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior,” Su Liu’er asked in a testing manner. “You…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was just speaking randomly,” the man smiled. “I have to break into Mount Supreme, so Liu’er-jie, don’t worry. Just wait over to the side for the results.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, he walked in front of Mount Supreme’s arched door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior Six Eared Macaque.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you want me to do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Six Eared Macaque is a female spiritual monkey who spoke very gently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was attentive and observative, and able to discern the origins of many things.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It could be said that her strength laid not in battle, but in deduction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can you help me take a look and see which two spots on the arched door are completely identical?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Six Eared Macaque raised her eyebrows, then walked in front of the arched door as her pupils turned violet. If one looked at the door with their naked eye, the arched door seemed to have identical spots all over the place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, if one could look at it in more detail, that wasn’t the case…</span></p>
 <p><span style>An hour passed by in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Six Eared Macaque pointed out two circles on the door, then said to the man, “These two.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thanks,” the man cupped his hands towards the Six Eared Macaque, then went over and placed his hands on the two spots she pointed out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A hint of ice-cold flames begun to appear forth from the center of his palm, then the two circled locations began to get burnt black.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, he retracted the flames and formed a fist with his right hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Open!” He punched the arched door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, the entirety of Mount Supreme trembled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The door shattered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who dares to cause trouble at Mount Supreme!” An angry yell rang out the moment the arched door shattered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Duan Hai appeared at the entrance with a frown, “Leave, or die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Duan Hai, not killing you back then was truly my mistake,” the mysterious man smiled, then stretched his neck and walked over slowly. “Allow me to make up for my mistakes back then!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Buzz…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Raging spiritual energy was released from the man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the surrounding Human Immortal experts alongside Su Liu’er and the three Yao Emperors couldn’t help but kneel when they felt the pressure.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This spiritual energy.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>This is definitely spiritual energy surpassing that of an Immortal King.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You…” Duan Hai felt his eyes twitch when he felt the pressure. “How’s that possible? How could a Sky Supreme expert appear here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Afraid? You were very cocky back then. You engulfed Qiu Yuan’s soul and took over his body, causing my friends to be completely slaughtered. You… never showed this sort of expression back then,” the man smiled coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, as Duan Hai turned around to flee…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You want to leave!?” The man lifted his hand and grabbed forward, causing Duan Hai to return to his hand uncontrollably. “Allow me to repeat what you said back then. You want to run in front of me? You’re just delusional!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man smacked down on Duan Hai’s skull cap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duan Hai struggled repeatedly, but was unable to get free. Then, his gaze became empty, and his body turned small until he was the size of a four or five years old child.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Return to being an artifact spirit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duan Hai’s body shattered, then turned into speckles of light while disappeared into Mount Supreme.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, the man raised his eyebrows and looked towards the Fatty, “I’ll leave the rest to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re not going to see him?” the Fatty raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man shook his head with a smile. “There’s no need for us to meet. We will naturally meet when the time comes. Oh yeah, give the inheritance to a kid named Qiu Yuan. It’s supposed to go to him. And also… give him this armor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man took a set of armor out of nowhere and placed it onto the ground. Anyone could tell from first glance that it was no ordinary item from the glow of spiritual energy around it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Give it to him. It’ll work as a compensation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You really are daring,” the fatty was surprised. Then he picked up the armor and nodded. “I understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">With that, the man leapt into the sky and disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mount Supreme’s rules cannot be destroyed. Wait here, I’ll go and bring Ye Zichen out. Remember, no one is allowed to step in there!” the fatty swept his gaze over the Sky Immortals, then walked into the cave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rumble.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who was sitting idly in the room, suddenly felt the space around him vibrate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“An earthquake?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows and noticed his two teammates already standing up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’re running?” He looked toward his teammates.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment, three more black-robed people suddenly appeared at the entrance to their room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sun Yige, if you’re not going to make the move now, then when are you going to do it!?” The three people suddenly shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, the smaller black-robed person behind Ye Zichen suddenly took out a dagger and thrust towards Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p></p>

 <p></p>
 <p>Wait for me? So… I'm going to meet the guy behind the system now? What!?</p>
 <p>Usually in the system doesn't appear in the novels… They are usually unexplained existences or actually an old man or something. But instead, I'm going to meeting the system now!?</p>
 <p>Man, I wonder what he or she is going to be like. The person I most likely some sort of fierce warrior I suppose… actually or he might be some wacky scientist guy. I can totally imagine that as well.</p>
 <p>Wait, no. First things first, I need to ask my teammates whether they are willing to stay here.</p>
