 <p><span style>Chapter 519 – The Jade Emperor’s alt account</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was extremely hesitant about what he should do when he saw the friend request.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fact that the Jade Emperor sending him a friend request most definitely caught him off guard. He took a look at the method at which the Jade Emperor had found him, and saw that it was actually by a search.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just how did the Jade Emperor find me?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>There is definitely some sort of secret.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen bit his lips, then after hesitating for thirty seconds or so, he finally chose to accept it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He naturally checked out their intimacy level the moment the he accepted the friend request.</span></p>
 <p><span style>0.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their intimacy level naturally showed just how they would chat later. Just as Ye Zichen was considering whether he should send the Heavenly Court Big Boss a message…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Only Idealism.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jade Emperor proactively sent him a message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Ye Zichen could not feel the Jade Emperor’s tone from the ice-cold words on the screen, he imagined that it was not very friendly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Boss Jade Emperor, what business do you have with this little one?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was the Jade Emperor’s only reply.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could he be laughing?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>No, that’s impossible. It definitely wasn’t as simple as that.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I wonder why Big Boss Jade Emperor is laughing?” Ye Zichen asked in a testing manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, is the fact that Sky Sovereign Nameless calling himself little one not worthy of this Emperor’s chuckle? Sky Sovereign, there are only so few people who could call themselves as a Sky Sovereign out of the vast number of deities in the Heavenly Court.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen felt rather guilty when he saw Jade Emperor’s reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason he was able to call himself Sky Sovereign was because the ex-butler of the Heavenly Court, Taibai Jinxing, had gotten him that position previously. Now that Taibai Jinxing had departed from the Heavenly Court, Ye Zichen naturally felt rather guilty when he came into contact with the Jade Emperor, the big boss of the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hahaha…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen chuckled a bit. He didn’t want to discuss about the topic, since he would definitely get found out sooner or later if he continued.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Keep laughing. This Emperor has already checked. There are a total of twelve Sky Sovereigns in the Heavenly Court, and there isn’t a position of Sky Sovereign Nameless.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was worried. </span><i><span style>What is the Jade Emperor talking to me for? It feels like he wants to punish me.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I wonder what exactly did Jade Emperor come to me for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You still dare to ask this emperor? If it wasn’t because you kicked this emperor’s alt, would this emperor need to add you with my main?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Alt!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Stop kidding me. I wouldn’t dare to kick your alt no matter what.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wait, no, I really did seem to have just kicked an alt.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>The Little Prince was destroying the serenity within the group. I kicked him, could it be that he…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You are Little Prince?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, this emperor was the prince of a certain kingdom before becoming a deity. Originally, this emperor was lurking rather well in the group. You are truly daring for kicking this emperor out of the group.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is there something wrong with him!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>That was what Ye Zichen thought in his heart. </span><i><span style>He kept on arguing with the deities in the group without telling them who he is.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>As the admin, I have to kick out people like that. Otherwise, my group will never grow.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But I can’t tell him this. Jade Emperor is the Big Boss of the Heavenly Court. Although I’m not in the Heavenly Court, I’m still within the Three Realms. I definitely wouldn’t have a good life if I piss him off.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Jade Emperor, then what do you want to do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to re-enter the group. After that, you are forbidden to tell others of this emperor’s identity. This emperor is going to lurk in the group and see what those guys are doing every day!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Jade Emperor stopped replying after Ye Zichen’s response with a coy smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Back in the Red Packet Server, Yang Jian kept on talking about descending, and had continuously mentioned Ye Zichen…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t really have much to do recently. If you guys want to come down, then do so!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: I waited for you for so long. Alright, since you said that, then Old Pig and I will go down now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: Sky Sovereign, wait for me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: I want to see Big Brother a lot too…</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Sky Sovereign, come back to the Heaven Court and see us when you have time. I’m busy recently, so I can’t go down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chang’e: Can I come down as well?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone else instantly stopped speaking when Chang’e spoke up. All of them knew about her relationship with Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who sat in the room, rubbed his nose. </span><i><span style>Should I let her come down or not?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Just as he was hesitating…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Little Prince entered the group through scanning the QR code.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: F*ck this…</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Fortune: How did this grandson come back in again?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: …</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: Why do I have a foreboding feeling that a war is about to be triggered?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: Selling melon seeds, peanuts and water in the front line!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Little Prince: I truly feel hurt that you actually became like this as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Can you stop blabbering? Sky Sovereign, hurry up and kick this brat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen felt extremely troubled when he saw all the messages mentioning him in the chat. </span><i><span style>The ignorant are fearless.</span></i><span style> That is definitely the truth.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>They merely think that Little Prince is a retard. I wonder if they’ll end up crying if they find out that the person they have been mocking all along is the Jade Emperor…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t come to this sovereign for any matters related to Little Prince from now on. Ahem… But group members, try to argue less. We need harmony in the group. Alright, that’s that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen directly left the group. However…</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Heh, since Sky Sovereign isn’t going to care, then Little Prince, speak less from now on so you don’t piss everyone off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Fortune: Don’t let laozi find out who you are, otherwise I’ll break your leg.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: Keeping doing what you’re doing. Old Pig is going to go and find Sky Sovereign with Yang Jian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Go.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Little Prince: You guys are descending? Who allowed you to do that?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Retard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While gunpowder filled the chat group, Ye Zichen put his phone aside, and grabbed a spiritual fruit he stole from Monkey Bro.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>They really would weep out tears of despair if they end up finding out Little Prince’s real identity.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wait a sec, the preparation for the auction this time really is a bit too long. I’ve been waiting here for half an hour, and all the seats below have been filled. Why haven’t the auction started yet?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Did something bad happen?” Ye Zichen couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows, while he couldn’t help but think in that direction due to what had occurred in the prior auction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment, someone knocked lightly on his door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He glanced over, then put away his phone, which he had placed onto the table, then stood up and walked to the door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he opened the door, he saw a young man, who was obviously a rich person from first glance, around his age, smile at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I wonder if I can come and sit in your room?”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Original Chapter Teaser:</strong>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Huh? What did he send me a friend request for?</p>
 <p>Did I end up offending him? Or did he notice something?</p>
 <p>Wait, no. Why is he sending me a friend request? This makes no sense. He has no idea who I am. I doubt he even knows about my existence, so why the heck is he sending me a friend request!?</p>
 <p>Gah, what should I do? Should I accept it? Like... What should I say then? Hi, I'm Sky Sovereign Nameless?</p>
 <p>No, that wouldn't work. He probably knows that Sky Sovereign Nameless is just a fake name...</p>
 <p>FML, what the heck am I supposed to do now!?</p>
