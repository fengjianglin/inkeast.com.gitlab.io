 <p><span style>Chapter 479 – Yue Lao’s Visit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: Hello.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen walked to secluded place and looked at his phone. When he saw the system greeting him, he couldn’t help but roll his eyes. </span><i><span style>What’s wrong with this guy, why’s he spouting English now?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you want now!?” Ye Zichen said in annoyance towards his phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a while, his phone buzzed again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: Don’t be like that. I will feel depressed if you treat me like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I really want to punch you,” Ye Zichen was seriously annoyed by the system.</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: Alright, then I’ll speak to you in a normal way. Actually, there is a mission I want to issue to you. However, I wanted to ask you for your opinion on it before assigning it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is there something wrong with you? When have you become so caring!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The previous missions had all been random, and he would be fine if he completed them. If he didn’t, then he would’ve been killed.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He’s actually asking me for my opinion now. This is seriously strange.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: Times are changing, and so must I. This mission is actually pretty simple. How about picking up that girl called Zuo Mo?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s something wrong with you!” Ye Zichen immediately cursed the system the moment he saw the message. “Seriously, I think that something wrong with your brain. Why are you acting dumb now? Picking up Zuo Mo? Do you want me to die? Or are you unhappy about me being alive? If that’s the case, then just directly kill me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: Why are you throwing such a tantrum, isn’t Zuo Mo a really nice girl? She’s the future controller of the Treasure Tower. Her ability, looks, personality and talent are all top-notch. So many people are interested in this girl, and you aren’t?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you are going to continue being like that, then let our chat end here!” With that, Ye Zichen decided to quit WeChat and walk off again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: Don’t. Look, that’s why I’m asking. If you disagree, then let’s not pick her up. But I still suggest for you to get on good terms with her even if we don’t pick her up. There are many things in the future she can help you with in the Three Realms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t like purposefully getting close to anyone. If we can get on good terms, then great. If we can’t, then so what? No need to force it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: You really are young! Whatever, let’s go according to your plan!</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was not what Ye Zichen was expecting. He never even expected the system to actually submit to him. </span><i><span style>This is way too different from the strong-arm way it acted before. Am I actually dreaming…?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: Since you have already arrived in the Three Realms, then you must think before you act. Don’t act impulsively. Alright, that’s it. If Yue Lao comes to find you later, then you can tell him to start all the other factories… Ignore the Demon Realm’s actions, and ignore whether they will make a move on the Three Realms. What you need to do is earn intimacy level in the Heavenly Court. It’s still the same as before, the more the better.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoosh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ten-odd minutes after the messages appeared, they all disappeared from Ye Zichen screen once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shrugged after seeing it, then couldn’t help but retort, “It’s not worried that I didn’t see the messages.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>There does seem to be some deeper meaning behind the system’s words. Ignore the Demon Realm’s actions, and ignore whether they will make a move on the Three Realms, merely earn intimacy level in the Heavenly Court…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Of course I will earn more intimacy levels with the Heavenly Court, but this isn’t the first time he has reminded me of doing that.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What a strange fellow.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Just as he put away the phone, one of the Spiritual Breeze villagers ran over to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Ye, someone’s looking for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>An extremely excited old man stood outside the entrance to the manor. He was Yue Lao of the Heavenly Court. At that moment, he was repeatedly tidying up his clothes. Although he had talked with Ye Zichen through his phone for a long time, it was going to be his first face-to-face meeting with Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This Sky Sovereign is my boss, I have to leave a good impression.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You are?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao didn’t recognize Ye Zichen, and nor did Ye Zichen recognize Yue Lao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was the reason why Ye Zichen asked in a testing manner when he saw the old man standing in front of the gate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are Sky Sovereign Nameless, right?” Yue Lao also replied in a testing manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was momentarily shocked, before he remembered what the system said earlier, “You’re Yue Lao?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I’ve seen Yue Lao using the Great Dao of Heaven’s Birth, but this isn’t what I remember him looking like…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The old man in front of Ye Zichen could be described as a white-haired man with a youthful appearance. He also seemed to be taller than Ye Zichen remembered. </span><i><span style>More importantly, his face is so shiny that he looks like he’s in some sort of cosmetic essence ad…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s going on? This geezer actually put on makeup before coming here?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, yes, yes. That’s me!” Yue Lao nodded repeatedly with a smile. “Sky Sovereign, we have only chatted in the groups before, and now we’ve finally had the chance to meet. Honestly, you are as handsome as I thought you are, and look full of might.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen forced a smile, “Alright, it’s not our first time talking, so no need for the courteous words. It’s tiring for you to say, and annoying for me to hear. Did you to find me because Yang Jian told you to?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!” Yue Lao nodded with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then, I have a question for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a question that pondered Ye Zichen for a long time. He had always been worried that he wouldn’t get the answer he wanted, so he didn’t dare to ask the question to Yue Lao over the phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please ask away.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Would a marriage string break if one person dies?”</span></p>
 <p>Ye Zichen’s entire body trembled slightly when he asked the question. He stared straight at Yue Lao with clenched fists…</p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The existence of the marriage strings link two people. If one of them dies, then the marriage string will naturally break.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If the marriage string didn’t break, then does that mean that neither person died?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course!” Yue Lao continued to answer with certainty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Ye Zichen heard that, he lost all strength in his legs, causing him to lean back against the wall as he took out his phone and opened up the Treasure Chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first row of the Treasure Chest was filled with marriage strings. Su Yan’s, Xia Keke’s…</span></p>
 <p><span style>And Xiao Yumei’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei’s marriage string still laid within Ye Zichen’s Treasure Chest and had not disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not dead… She’s not dead!” Ye Zichen’s eyes turned red as he muttered to himself. When Xiao Yumei had suddenly disappeared in front of his eyes in the Modern Realm, Ye Zichen assumed that she had died since it was in that sort of circumstance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was only after he got to the Three Realms that he noticed Xiao Yumei’s marriage string with him still remained in his Treasure Chest when he was reorganizing it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From that moment onwards, Ye Zichen had pondered about that question. He wanted to ask it, but he didn’t dare. This time, he finally mustered up enough courage to ask the question, and…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not dead!” Ye Zichen looked up into the sky and laughed. It had been on his mind the entire time… However, Yue Lao’s reply made Ye Zichen loosen up a lot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign?” Yue Lao stood on the side, his face showing his confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows and smiled, before wiping away the tears from the corners of his eye, “What happened?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothing,” Yue Lao shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Ye Zichen was still submerged within his joy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since the marriage string didn’t break, then it meant that Xiao Yumei was still alive. That also meant that Xiao Yumei was current living somewhere in an unknown realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is great,” Ye Zichen smiled in comfort.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a long while, when he finally calmed himself down, he turned towards Yue Lao, “What did you come seek me out for?”</span></p>

 <p><b>System Notification:&nbsp;</b>Hey.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>What now!?</p>

 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>... The heck do you want?</p>
 <p><strong>System Notification:&nbsp;</strong>Nuthin' I'm bored.</p>

 <p><strong>System Notification:&nbsp;</strong>Now, now, don't be like that. You're hurting my feelings.</p>
