 <p><span style>Chapter 207 – The Yellow Emperor’s Destined Girl</span></p>
 <p><span style>At a twenty-four hour restaurant outside the Polytechnic University.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke held a mirror in her hands as she fixed her makeup. This was the first time that Ye Zichen had invited her out, and it was in this sort of hour…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could it be that tonight, they were going to…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Thinking about that, Xia Keke became beyond shy. Although she liked Ye Zichen a lot, their relationship wasn’t at that level yet, right!?</span></p>
 <p><span style>In order to decrease the nervousness in her heart, she could only continuously fix her make-up so that she would look even more beautiful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The door to the restaurant was pushed open.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen walked in with a smile. At the same time, Xia Keke’s eyes lit up, then her face started to blush, while she dipped her head and started to fidget with the corner of her clothes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Keke!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen…” At that moment, Xia Keke’s voice was like honey. She bit her lips, then asked with both nervousness and anticipation. “Why did you find me so late…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, there’s something I want to talk to you about.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Say it!” Xia Keke replied in a very soft and trembling voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Using this chance, Ye Zichen yanked Liu Qing over and raised his eyebrows, “You can see her, right!?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Her?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke’s delicate face blanked out for a moment. Then, a sliver of panic flashed across her eyes before she asked curiously, “Who? Why can’t I see her?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Keke!” Liu Qing murmured.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke let out a sigh, then put her make-up away with a smile, “This isn’t the place to talk about this, let’s speak outside.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Beside the flowerbed outside the girl’s dormitory in the Polytechnic University, Ye Zichen smoked softly, while the orange flame became extremely eye-catching in the dark night.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke had pulled Liu Qing into her embrace, then chatted secretly for a long while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How did you know?” At that moment, Xia Keke walked over with a faint smile on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zhuge Kongming told me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That shitty brat!’ Xia Keke clenched her fist, while heart-trembling rage surfaced on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a while, she let out a sigh and twitched her mouth, “Alright, you know it all, so be it. Since we’re the same, there really wasn’t anything to hide from you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then which deity does your family worship!?” Ye Zichen asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke suddenly rolled her eyes at him with a look of speechlessness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who told you that my family worship deities? Did that shitty brat, Zhuge Kongming not tell you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but roll his eyes when he thought of how tightly Zhuge Kongming had sealed his mouth, “He wouldn’t say!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm, so he does have a brain,” Xia Keke snorted with a smile. Then, her hair gradually turned gold, her eyes gradually turned gold as well, while faint traces of dragon scales slowly crawled up her arm. “Now you understand, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gulp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen did not notice the dragon scale patterns on her arm, but he did see the gold hair and eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You-You’re a Super Saiyan!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>My god!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Earth truly f*cking has Super Saiyans!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I swear to god, I only tricked the yellow hair to mess with him, f*ck…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Then did you come to Earth to collect the seven Dragon Balls?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>”Sai your ass!”</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>Xia Keke raised her hand and knocked Ye Zichen’s head, then she put her arm in front of his eyes. “Look carefully. Dragon scales! Our family is of the dragon race, an ancient divine beast. Our clan worships the Four Sacred Beasts!” <a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Dragon race.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Aren’t those what Nezha slays for fun?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“How’s your clan’s relationship with Nezha?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nezha? You’re talking about that evil dragon-slaying criminal!?” Xia Keke glared, when coupled with her ‘Super Saiyan’-look, she appeared extremely menacing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen licked his lips and took a step back. </span><i><span style>Zhuge Kongming was truly right when he said that she was a female tyrannosaur.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>However, this Nezha truly is an expert of dragon-slaying. It seems like he has a grudge with Xia Keke’s family too?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s never slayed any of the descendants of the sacred beasts’ bloodline,” Xia Keke exited her Super Saiyan mode and shrugged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You nearly scared me to death,” Ye Zichen raised his hand and smacked her on the head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke twitched her mouth in a troubled manner, then yanked Liu Qing with a pout, “Liu Qing, Ye Zichen bullied me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who allowed you to bully our family’s Keke!” Liu Qing put her hands on her waist and stood in front of Xia Keke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing this, Ye Zichen sighed silently. </span><i><span style>This pair would definitely torture him to death in the future!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke scratched her head, when a sudden light suddenly flashed across Xia Keke’s eyes, “Liu Qing, I have some things that I want to say to Ye Zichen in private.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why does it have to be behind my back?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Be a good girl, we have plenty of time to talk in the future. I have some private matters that I want to talk to him with.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright,” Liu Qing pouted in a depressed manner, then flew back into the Dragon Eye within Ye Zichen’s pocket.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke squinted her eyes, “I’m very curious about how you got into contact with Liu Qing. I sought her out for a long time before, but I couldn’t find her. I had thought that she had already gone to the Underworld to reincarnate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It was sort of a coincidence…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen explained to Xia Keke about how he go to know Liu Qing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he finished, Xia Keke looked at him in shock, “You can revive Liu Qing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, I’ve nearly got everything needed…” Ye Zichen scratched his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke immediately hugged him around his neck and smooched him, “You’re such a great person.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen lifted his hand and touched his warm cheek. </span><i><span style>Zeze…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Good deeds really are rewarded!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Very soon, Ye Zichen licked his lips, then smiled, “I also have a question to ask you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What question?” Xia Keke tiled her head in puzzlement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why have you always been living in the Modern World….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In order to escape from the marriage!” Xia Keke rolled her eyes in annoyance. “You saw that shitty brat, Zhuge Kongming, right? My family is determined to marry me to him, and it was an engagement done when we were young… In order to resist, I ran away!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Impossible!” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows and smiled. “if that was purely it, then your family can grab you back whenever. You definitely have other purposes to remain here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh? When did you become so smart?” Xia Keke looked at him. After a while, she sighed softly. “Fine, then I won’t hide it from you, it does kind of give you a sense of danger as well…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What sense of danger!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m staying here in order to find The One,” Xia Keke smiled, revealing cute dimples on her face. “My family did put me in an engagement with Zhuge Kongming, but that is just a façade to protect me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen didn’t understand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re so dumb,” Xia Keke raised her hand and knocked him on the shoulder, before leaning close to his ear. “Actually, I’m looking for the Yellow Emperor’s reincarnation!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was stunned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yellow Emperor.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He’s a geezer from who knows how many years back, why is she searching for his reincarnation!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“My clan told me that I’m the reincarnation of Xia Liuli, a girl of the Yellow Emperor for three of his lives. They insist on me finding the Yellow Emperor, they said that it will cause the clan to be prosperous or something… How is it, do you feel a sense of danger? I’m telling you, I’m the Yellow Emperor’s destined one, hmph!” </span></p>

 <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Original Chapter Teaser:</b>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p><b>Xia Keke:&nbsp;</b>La-lala-lala. What did Riche Bro call me out so late for? At this hour... It can't be!? Oh no, what should I say? Should I accept? Or should I refuse? Ahhh so troublesome!</p>
 <p><em>Xia Keke frantically redoes her make-up.</em></p>
 <p><strong>Xia Keke:&nbsp;</strong>Kyaaaa, I mean, I like him so much. But... Maybe it's a bit too early? Maybe just a little too early? Ahhh, what should I do!?</p>
 <p><em>Ye Zichen walks in with Liu Qing.</em></p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Hey, Keke, I have something to ask you.</p>
 <p><strong>Xia Keke:&nbsp;</strong>Huh? Zichen-gege, you're already here! Uhm, I...</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Keke, be honest, you can see her, right?</p>
 <p><em>Ye Zichen points to Liu Qing...</em></p>
 <p><strong>Xia Keke:&nbsp;</strong>I don't see anyone there?</p>
 <p><strong>Liu Qing:&nbsp;</strong>Keke...</p>
 <p><strong>Xia Keke:&nbsp;</strong>Fine, let's go talk about it elsewhere.</p>
 <p><em>Two hours later... After Xia Keke and Liu Qing chatted intimately for a long time.</em></p>
 <p><strong>Xia Keke:&nbsp;</strong>So... Zichen-gege, any questions?</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Yeah, just 1, which deity does your clan worship?</p>
 <p><strong>Xia Keke:&nbsp;</strong>Deity? Pfft. We don't worship any deities!</p>
 <p><em>Xia Keke's hair and eyes begins to turn gold.</em></p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>(rubs his eyes) This-This cannot be! You're a SUPER SAIYAN!!! So... YOU WORSHIP PRINCE KAKAROT!</p>
