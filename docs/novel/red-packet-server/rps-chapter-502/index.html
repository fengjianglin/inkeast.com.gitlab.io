 <p><span style>Chapter 502 – Honor Cannot be Violated</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ahem.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but blink when he heard the other person’s self-introduction, while Lil’ White laughed loudly.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Zhen Niubi.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>This name is seriously awesome</span></i><span style><span><a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></span></span><i><span style>!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Bro, what’s there to know about them?” Zhen Yingjun’s expression turned for the worse when he saw that his older brother actually went to introduce himself to the others instead of getting revenge for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yingjun!” Zhen Niubi squinted his eyes. </span><i><span style>These are clearly not people to easily offend.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The ability to take human form symbolized both status and identity. From what he recalled about his little brother, his little brother was not such a brainless person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big bro, don’t you understand yet? These people are actually human merchants. Why else would they be standing here? It is clear that they want to get into contact with us, the fox yaos, but they aren’t able to enter without an invitation,” Zhen Yingjun snorted. The yaos from powerful races such as theirs really did not care about human merchants at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That feeling that felt was exactly the same as how locals would look towards foreigners who had settled down. No matter how strong they are, they are still foreigners.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Humans?” Zhen Niubi was momentarily stunned when he hear that, before the disdain became clear on his face.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Humans.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Then why am I bullshitting with them!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“So you’re actually human merchants. I thought you were from some large family. Since you’re humans, then we have to have a nice long chat,” Zhen Niubi cracked his neck, then raised his eyebrows. “What are you going to do about hitting my little brother?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sudden change in attitude made Ye Zichen and co. completely speechless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen merely shrugged, “I hit him, so what? What do you want to do to me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? I, Zhen Niubi am rather awesome in the Central Continent. The honor of the Black Fox Yaos cannot be violated. I heard that you human merchants are rather rich. Compensate my brother fifty million spirits marks, then kneel down and apologize to him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mwahahahahahaha…” Ye Zichen couldn’t help but laugh out loud.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhen Yingjun raised his eyebrows, “Big bro, why is he laughing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They’re definitely shocked by my kingly aura,” Zhen Niubi chuckled proudly. “There isn’t anyone on the Central Continent that dares to act cocky with me, Zhen Niubi. Big bro will help you take revenge later. Not only will I make him compensate you with money, I’ll make him lose face as well!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, he walked forward with his hands on his hips, then snorted cockily with his chin raised, “Brat, don’t think that I’ll let you off just because you put on a pitiful look.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ai, you came to crack jokes, didn’t you?” Ye Zichen raised his hand and cracked his neck, then looked towards Zhen Niubi and co. “Laozi haven’t been able to loosen up too well over since I arrived in the Three Realms. Since you guys are so shamelessly asking for a beating, then I’ll satisfy you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen hooked his fingers towards them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhen Yingjun immediately walked over to his older brother… “Big bro!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, getting pretentious with me!? Get him, you guys must beat this brat to submission, and make him understand that the honor of the Black Fox Clan cannot be violated!” Zhen Niubi and Zhen Yingjun immediately rushed over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen merely stood on the spot with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang. Bang. Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhen Yingjun and Zhen Niubi ended up on the floor with swollen faces alongside their clansmen in mere moments.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Was that fun?” Ye Zichen put his hands in his pocket, then squatted in front of the two brothers. He slapped Zhen Niubi. “You still awesome or not?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brat, you tricked us!” Zhen Niubi cursed angrily on the floor. They had thought that the one who would fight the was Ye Zichen, but the one who truly attacked was Jail King and the guest chamberlains who came with Lil’ White.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every single one of them were experts of the complete stage Human Immortal level, or the Sky Immortal level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter how awesome Zhen Niubi was, he would be beaten up until he wasn’t awesome at all!</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>“I never said that I would fight you guys by myself, right?” Ye Zichen smiled, then patted Zhen Niubi’s face. “Don’t be called Zhen Niubi from now on, and call yourself Bu Niubi<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>, get it?”</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is the land of the fox yaos, you dare…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen kicked Zhen Niubi in his stomach, then squinted his eyes and placed his hands by his ear, “What did you say? My hearing isn’t that good, so I couldn’t hear you that clearly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I said this is the fox yaos’ …”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you say?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The fox yaos…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you say?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was something which repeated for six or seven times, and only when Zhen Niubi finally shut up about them being in the land of the fox yaos did Ye Zichen stop bullying him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Instead, Ye Zichen merely chuckled, “You still awesome?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, not anymore!” Zhen Niubi repeatedly shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen then squinted his eyes and chuckled, “Can the Black Fox Clan’s honor be violated?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Any time!” Zhen Niubi replied with a coy smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded in satisfaction, then lifted his foot off Zhen Niubi’s back, and slowly walked in front of Zhen Yingjun.</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>“Big bro, I’m not Bu Yingjun<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>! Not handsome at all. Just look at my face, it’s already like this…” Zhen Yingjun did not want to get beaten once again, and when he saw his older brother get beaten up so harshly, he instantly gave in.</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only thing which answered him was a merciless kick.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did I ask you anything? You immediately speaking is you trying to show off how smart you are, right? You learned to answer quickly now, haven’t you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, no,” Zhen Yingjun shook his head repeatedly with a forced smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen kicked him again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhen Yingjun muttered in a troubled manner, “I didn’t say anything special. Why did you kick me again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I just want to kick you because of your damn looks. You got a problem with that?” Ye Zichen put his hands in his pocket and asked with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhen Yingjun quickly shook his head with a tearful look, “None at all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite saying that, he still silently waited for the people from the Nine Tail Fox Clan to come.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Black Fox Yaos were a vassal clan of the Nine Tail Foxes. Although they didn’t have a particularly high status, they were still fox yaos, so it was impossible for the Nine Tail Foxes to just ignore them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Plenty of people from other clans who have come to the birthday party also noticed the situation over there. When they saw that it was actually the Black Fox Yaos getting bullied, they all became rather surprised.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Beating up the subordinate in the territory of the boss was definitely face smacking!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But the Nine Tail Foxes haven’t arrived. I wonder how the situation is going to change.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right,” Ye Zichen smiled, then reached his hand towards Zhen Yingjun…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhen Yingjun thought that Ye Zichen was going to hit him once again, so he quickly covered his face with his hands, then hid it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but chuckle when he saw how funny Zhen Yingjun looked, then kicked him a little.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t cover your face. Laozi doesn’t want to hit you right now. C’mon, give me your invitation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You won’t be able to enter even if I gave it to you,” Zhen Yingjun complained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen frowned when he heard those words, “Why do you have so much bullshit? Do you want to get beaten up?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t, don’t, don’t. Here…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Zhen Yingjun handed the invitation over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Ye Zichen reached his hand over to grab the invitation, it directly flew up. Then, when everybody looked up, they saw a foxy lady in a blue dress smile as she walked towards them.</span></p>
