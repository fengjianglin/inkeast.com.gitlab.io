 <p><span style>Chapter 43 – Taking in the ghost girl</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen zoned out when he saw the ghost girl’s smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why is that ghost girl so cute, this is too unfair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the ghost girl noticed Ye Zichen’s expression, she instantly floated to the top of the car and frowned, while covering the front of her chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you doing, don’t try to do lewd things to me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come on down.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his hand and yanked the ghost girl down by her leg. The car was only so big, so she couldn’t hide anywhere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you doing, I’m telling you I’m a virgin female ghost. If you touch me, then misfortune will fall upon you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ghost girl was completely vigilant. She looked as if Ye Zichen was really going to do something to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Say, ghost girl, we are separated by life and death, don’t be so narcistic okay? There are loads of girls waiting for me to chat them up around me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was afraid that the ghost girl wouldn’t believe him, so he took out his phone and turned to Su Yan’s Moments.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>She can’t have blocked him, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that there were no messages in Su Yan’s Moments, he sent a message in a testing manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hello!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dearly Beloved has activated friend verification. You are not his (her) friend.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Please send a friend request…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahahaha, you got deleted!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ghost girl’s voice was extremely happy. Ye Zichen immediately made a “wait a moment” gesture, and clicked on Xia Keke’s Moments.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ha, he wasn’t deleted this time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Look!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen scrolled down, but that ghost girl was dazed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Keke.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You know her?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen opened his eyes wide in shock when that ghost girl revealed a pitiful smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How is she?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed like this ghost girl really does know Xia Keke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She’s great, she’s a school beauty at Polytechnic University.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That’s great,” the ghost girl revealed a reminiscent look and smiled. “We said that we were going to get into Polytechnic University together before. I didn’t think that she truly ended up going to this university. Oh yeah, Xia Keke and I were great friends!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen subconsciously gulped, and touched his elbow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To be honest, he was getting goosebumps.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This ghost girl actually knew Xia Keke, and the two had promised to get into the same university.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And the one they had chosen was Polytechnic University.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, he could guess that they knew each other in high school.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was because there are only so many universities in the minds of children in primary or middle school.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can I ask an intrusive question? When did you die?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Two years ago, right before the National Matriculation Examinations.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ghost girl’s face was full of smiles, but that smile was filled with unspeakable trouble.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sigh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen put his hand on his chest and breathed in and out several times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had a feeling that…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had got mixed up into something huge.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Trouble before the National Matriculation Examinations…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Before her time!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Murder!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As goosebumps covered Ye Zichen’s body, he deliberately ignored his thoughts in order to calm himself down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Back to the main topic, see if there’s anywhere on me that you can stay. Just follow me in the future. Aren’t you and Xia Keke good friends? If you come with me, then you might be able to meet her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is there a need?” The ghost girl shook her hand and smiled. “Even if we meet, can we chat like this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clearly knew that it wasn’t possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason he could see the ghost girl was due to the Great Sage’s Fiery Eyes of Truth. Xia Keke was a normal person, how could she see her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Humans and ghosts were different, they are not the same.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she saw the anticipation in the ghost girl’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen replied with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ghost girl’s expression tensed, while Ye Zichen continued, “Believe me, a lot of weird things happen around me. Such as me being able to see you now. Stay by my side, I can help you get reborn.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re lying! It’s impossible for you to do something that even Grandpa Gu couldn’t do!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know who is the Grandpa Gu you’re talking about. I’m not him, so don’t use him to judge me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen squinted his eyes. He didn’t know who Grandpa Gu was, but he was definitely some sort of master since he had been able to see the ghost girl.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, so what if that person was a master? He has the group!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone in it are deities!</span></p>
 <p><span style>In order to help the ghost girl regain her confidence, Ye Zichen said another shocking thing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I promise that I will resurrect you and let you meet your parents and friends once again…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Resurrection.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ghost girl’s body trembled. She bit her lips and gripped her fists tightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is something on you that I can stay on.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Point it out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can’t find it, but I can sense it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately thought of it. He opened his phone’s Treasure Chest, and took out the Dragon Eye that he didn’t know the use for.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s this, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, the ghost girl snuck into the Dragon Eye. After she entered, the dim Dragon Eye quickly shrank to the size of a glass bead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Furthermore, it started to shine with white light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is very suitable for me to live, it can nurture my soul,” The ghost girl’s voice sounded rather joyful. Soon, she spoke up again in a solemn tone, “Can you really revive me? Even Grandpa Gu…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I said it already, I’m me! Believe me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen caressed that shimmering Dragon Eye. The Dragon Eye flashed intensely for a moment, as if the ghost girl was laughing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, I’ll believe you. Tell me your name.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hello, I’m Liu Qing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they got back to the school, it was right when the dorms were about to close. Ye Zichen rushed in right before it closed, then saw the animals strip dancing in the dorm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, why did you bring me here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing, who was in his pocket, immediately exclaimed after they entered the room. Ye Zichen slapped the Dragon Eye and said quietly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t this what a male dorm is like! If you don’t want to see, then just stay in the Dragon Eye.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aren’t I just curious? I’ve never been to university, isn’t it fine to satisfy my curiosity?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then stop being so shocked.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, what are you muttering to yourself for?” Kang Peng ran over in his boxers, causing Liu Qing to scream out, causing Ye Zichen’s eardrums to vibrate so much that it hurt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi, are you unwell?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m fine, just let me rest properly for a moment,” Ye Zichen didn’t take a shower, and directly laid down on the bed after stripping.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, go and shower!” Liu Qing said in dislike.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nope,” Ye Zichen turned around and covered himself with his blanket. Liu Qing put her hands on her waist and snorted, “Alright, you’re not going to wash, right…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahhhhhh…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s face was completely green when he walked to the public shower room with his bucket and towel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was kind of regretting bringing this ghost girl back out of good will, he clearly brought a mistress over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry up and wash, I’ll wait here for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing sat on the windowsill outside the bathroom and gazed up and the moon outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen glanced at her, then walked in with his shower gel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he turned on the tap, he closed his eyes and allowed the water to wet his hair. One name kept on repeating in Ye Zichen’s mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He doesn’t know what kind of story will unfold for her in the future.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However…</span></p>
 <p><span style>That ghost girl is really cute!</span></p>
