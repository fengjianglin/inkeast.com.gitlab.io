 <p><span style>Chapter 328 – Linhe Garden</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gou Yuzhan was truly angry.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>There are so many things to eat in Linhe Garden. I even felt really happy for finding this place after coming to the capital, but the people inside had always blocked my way and wouldn’t let me eat.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It was whatever before, since I do admit that I didn’t have a membership card…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But the guy that I don’t know already took out a membership card, those people are still not letting me in.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m telling you, hurry up and let me in. I’m not scared of you guys, if I actually get angry, even my dad’s scared of me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two strands on top of Gou Yuzhan’s hair vibrated, while he glared at the receptionist fiercely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You broke into Linhe Garden. The fact that we didn’t send you to the police station is already merciful. You still dare to act cocky with us… I’m telling you, they can enter, but you can’t!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The receptionist also glared at Gou Yuzhan fiercely. At the same time, Linhe Garden’s security guards also came over, with hostility surfacing in their eyes the moment they say Gou Yuzhan.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>We just threw him out and now he’s back again.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Fine, do you really think I, your grandfather, doesn’t dare!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A nunchuck suddenly appeared in his right hand in a magic trick like manner. Gou Yuzhan flung it around a few times, then posed like Bruce Lee.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Take this!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before he managed to fling the nunchuck, Ye Zichen directly smacked his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Take your ass.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kind shopkeeper, why did you hit me?” Gou Yuzhan wore a confused look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen let out a long sigh, then turned towards the security guards, “Bro, this friend of mine might not have a particular good reputation here, but he doesn’t have any ill intentions. He just wanted to grab something to eat. Since we have a membership card now, don’t be too strict, and just let him in.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir, it’s not that we aren’t allowing him. It’s that he has been blacklisted by Linhe Garden,” said one of the security guards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Gou Yuzhan became completely enraged, he immediately walked towards the entrance with his nunchuck in his hand, “Blacklisted? Fine, then let’s see after a good fight!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop for a moment,” Ye Zichen grabbed Gou Yuzhan by his collar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Ye Zichen suddenly smelled a faint fragrance of jasmine…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Gu,” a soft and confused voice called out. Ye Zichen turned over and saw that Hua Zhiru had suddenly appeared beside him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Hua!” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can you not copy that damn fatty? Can’t you call me Lil’ Ru or Zhiru? Why do you have to call me Lil’ Hua!” Hua Zhiru pouted in annoyance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, the security guards and the receptionist also quickly bowed in greetings, “Young Lady!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hua Zhiru nodded slightly towards the security guards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was stunned, “This is the property of your family!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm, it is!” Hua Zhiru smiled plainly. “I understand the approximate situation already. Let’s go in together!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The security guards blocking the way in front of them all quickly moved aside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As they walked in, Gou Yuzhan rolled his eyes at the security guards like a jerk, “Block my way, keep blocking my way!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he saw that the security guards did not dare to answer, Gou Yuzhan snorted proudly, then walked in behind Ye Zichen and co.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As they walked, Ye Zichen could clearly feel the gazes that the people within Linhe Garden directed towards them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>More precisely, they should be towards Hua Zhiru, who walked behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen could tell that she was extremely tired from her eyes, and thinking about what happened in the airport, it is very possible that it was caused by the situation of her family.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Gu, go around as you wish. There are some things I have to deal with,” Hua Zhiru suddenly stopped and smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go, just do what you need to,” Ye Zichen nodded towards her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After watching her leave, Lu Lu twitched her mouth then yanked the corner of Ye Zichen’s shirt with a frown, “Who is that woman? Why is she so close to you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“… Are you sure that she’s close to me? She doesn’t even know what my surname is. Do you really think that she’s close?” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes in annoyance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did Lu Lu mutter in sudden understanding, “Oh yeah, she called you Big Brother Gu just now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen patted her head and revealed a look of helplessness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Tian also smiled faintly as he glanced towards Hua Zhiru, who was walking to somewhere else, “Out of everyone in the Hua family, she should be the number one successor after Hua Lin dies. But it doesn’t seem like it’s going to be easy for her to inherit such a large family. As I expected, large families just have more stuff to care about.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t it the same for you?” Ye Zichen smiled. </span><i><span style>Large families are just trouble.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Erm… Can I go and eat something?” Gou Yuzhan asked. He had no interest in inheritance or whatnot. His greatest interest was eating…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go, go, go. &nbsp;But don’t cause trouble,” Ye Zichen said in annoyance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem!” Gou Yuzhan ran out excitedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Gu Tian decided to take Ye Zichen and Lu Lu around Linhe Garden.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Linhe Garden was actually a place for trading. There were professional appreciators for antiques as well as all sorts of flowers and plants…</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no need to be worried about being tricked there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As long as a person had enough money, they were able to buy anything they wanted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After taking a wander around Linhe Garden, Ye Zichen merely ordered a bit of snacks. On the other hand, Gu Tian actually bought quite a bit of stuff.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kind shopkeeper!” At that moment, Gou Yuzhan ran over quickly with a chicken leg in his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t call me kind shopkeeper, alright? Just call me by my name, Ye Zichen!” Ye Zichen frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s not important!” Gou Yuzhan shook his head. “That kind girl is in trouble!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kind girl?” Ye Zichen frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Lu Lu closed her eyes, then opened them after a few seconds, that Hua Zhiru is indeed in trouble. Do you want to go over to take a look?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hua Zhiru! Let’s go!” Ye Zichen frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gou Yuzhan instantly nodded, “Come with me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After going through two courtyards, Gou Yuzhan brought Ye Zichen and co. to the entrance of a large courtyard, which had two muscular men standing at the arched entrance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This isn’t a trading area. It is for staff only.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two hulks crossed their arms and blocked off the way, while a faint celestial spiritual aura was revealed.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Earth Immortal.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s eyes twitched. </span><i><span style>Bingcheng truly cannot compare up to the capital.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Even these guards are at the Earth Immortal level. It seems like the capital is truly filled with talented people.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Your young lady, Hua Zhiru is endangered inside. Let us in!” Ye Zichen frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two hulks in front of the door smiled, “That has nothing to do with us. Our mission is to stand guard here and not let anyone in!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hua Zhiru is in danger…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why waste your breath with them!” Lu Lu suddenly curled her lips, while a spiral of ice and snow appeared in her palm. “I’ll give you two two choices. Either f*ck off or die!”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Original Chapter Teaser:</b>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Are you kidding me!? You're not letting me in!? There are so many things to eat in Linhe Garden from fried chicken legs to all sorts of cakes to some really nice buns! They pretty much have everything I can ever think of. The only thing they sadly don't have is lollipop!</p>
 <p>But even so, I was super excited when I found this place after arriving in the capital. Yet, the staff here are always stopping me from eating.</p>
 <p>I mean, they had a semi-legit excuse because, since I actually didn't have a membership card before...</p>
 <p>But the guy that I don’t know already took out a membership card, those people are still not letting me in.</p>
 <p>Seriously, what do they have against me? This is definitely discrimination! I don't care what they say. If they don't let me in today, then I'm definitely going to trash this whole place!</p>
