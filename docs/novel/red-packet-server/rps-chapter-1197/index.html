 <p>The elder accompanying Chi Mei nodded, and his decrepit figure walked right towards Xiao Hu.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The elder’s hands flashed with seven-colored light. As it radiated outward, the surrounding space distorted. At the same time, it bulled a thin light from Xiao Hu’s body, which entered the hunched elder’s hand.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As time passed, Xiao Hu’s body grew indistinct.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The surrounding supremes all watched from the sidelines. They didn’t have words to express their terror. However, Yin Hu and the other yao looked relaxed; they knew who these new arrivals were, and that they wouldn’t hurt them.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Who exactly is Chi Mei?” Chi Mei had been a mystery from the moment they first met. At first, he’d suspected she was a descendant of the Five Elements Great Emperor, but then he heard the yao calling her “My Lady.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Also, that elder by her side overpowered Xiao Hu with a snap of his fingers.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>If she had such a mighty expert to protect her, why did she kick up such a fuss over a single sea condensing pill? Why did she deliberately approach him? What did she want out of him?&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Was she in it for the Yao-Sealing Pagoda? &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Or the Xuan-Yuan Sword?</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Zichen was uncertain, but the way he saw it, he and Chi Mei belonged to two different worlds. There was nothing about him worthy of attracted such a privileged young lady’s attention.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Boom!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A rift tore in the sky, and golden light mixed with lighting surged forth.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Instantly, the entire plane, from the Immortal Region, Heavenly Court, Underworld, and Endless Beast Region to the barren wastes, felt a presence bear down on them. It was so terrifying, they could barely breathe.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It shook all living things.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;Countless ultimate experts of the Lower Realms left seclusion and looked up into the rift in the heavens.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It was then that they discovered that, although everyone in their realms of influence revered them, they were petty and insignificant indeed.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>They forcefully suppressed their tremors and looked up at the rift. Just what was it, exactly? &nbsp;</p>
 <p>At that moment, however….</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Time! Stop!” A golden pendulum clock appeared in the sky. With a single crisp, clear clang, it froze.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The wind paused and the water stilled. It was as if the entire world had been frozen.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After freezing the entire plane, a child riding a blue ox rode into the wastes. “Xiao Family, you’ve crossed the line. We agreed to let you send sky supremes, but that was already a major concession. Even though you hid a wisp of a diviner’s soul in your weapon, I could look the other way. Yet now you’re trying to bring your true body down as well?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This has nothing to do with you. Scram!” A furious roar emanated from within the rift as a pair of massive hands emerged and ripped the sky asunder. Before long, a lightning-shrouded middle-aged man emerged. This was none other than Xiao Hu’s true body.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He stepped into the wastes, but as soon as he did, space showed signs of cracking around him; it couldn’t bear the pressure.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Don’t take this too far!” screamed the child from atop his ox.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I told you, don’t meddle in others’ business. If you do, I’ll kill you, too!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Crack! Boom!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A bolt of reddish-purple divine lightning crashed down onto the child, but just before it struck, a colorless barrier instantly manifested around him. Although the boy survived, the lightning destroyed almost half of the wastes.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Scram!” Xiao Hu glowered and roared, his voice booming. He was like a deity descending to the mortal realm. He stood proudly in the sky and roared at the child with no regard for his feelings.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You….” The boy glowered at him, but silently stood to the side. At that moment, however, Chi Mei appeared beside him out of nowhere. She reached out and tousled his hair, a hint of a smile in her eyes.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Don’t be afraid, little brother,” she said with a smile. “Big Sister’s here!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Next. she turned back to the elder and said solemnly, “Uncle Liu.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You want my diviner soul? I’ll be curious to see if you’re even capable of such a thing.” An illusory figure a hundred thousand feet tall manifested behind Xiao Hu. It was a hammer-bearing deity whose eyes flashed with electricity.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When Xiao Hu moved his arms, the illusory deity behind him moved along with him. They swung at the elder with enough force to shatter mountains and split rivers.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Noisy.” The elder raised his right hand without so much as lift his eyelids. To everyone’s astonishment, Xiao Hu immediately disappeared without a trace.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The shattered mountains then returned to their original state, as did the devastated wasteland. Finally, the rift in the sky knit back together.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It was as if nothing had ever happened.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At the same time, the elder held the diviner-soul incarnation of Xiao Hu and condensed it into a soul pearl.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Why’d you let him escape?” said Chi Mei after the elder handed her the soul.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“The space is too weak here. If I went all out here, I’m afraid I’d shatter the whole plane. Instead, I sent him away. Once you’ve settled things here, it won’t be too late for me to find and eliminate him.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Alright. But honestly, the Masters of Laws get worse with every generation.” She looked at the boy astride the ox, sighed, and shook her head.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She glanced at the giant pendulum clock next, then snapped her fingers. It immediately disappeared from the sky, taking the shepherd boy with it.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Where did it go?” The immortal kings of the lower realms looked up at the sky in bewilderment.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It wasn’t just them. The sky supremes gathered in the wastes looked up to the sky at a loss. Just now, they’d clearly sensed a transcendent presence descend to earth.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I can’t help but feel like I missed something.” Ye Zichen furrowed his brows too. The clock had frozen him too, but he got the sense that something had happened during that brief interval.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He looked around him, and it was as if nothing had changed. There were still the sky supremes, Chi Mei, and that elder, all standing right where they were before….</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Something wasn’t right.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>How did Xiao Hu disappear? &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Just now, his body obviously hadn’t fully disappeared yet.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“What are you think about, sweetie?” As Ye Zichen considered what had happened, Chi Mei put her hands behind her back like a little girl, walked up to him, and batted her eyes.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Chi Mei, oh, Chi Mei, just who are you?&nbsp;</em>Ye Zichen wondered to himself, then pressed his lips into a smile. “Oh, nothing. Right, where did Xiao Hu disappear to just now?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“He’s right here,” said Chi Mei. As she spoke, she took the diviner soul and placed it into Ye Zichen’s hand. “Here, a thunder-element diviner soul. It’s for you!”</p>
