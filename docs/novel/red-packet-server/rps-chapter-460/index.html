 <p><span style>Chapter 460 – The Troublesome Black Crystal Ores</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen slowly walked in front of the black iron ores, while Lil’ Yu smiled coldly as she watched from the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was already imagining Ye Zichen’s dejected face when he failed to deal with the black iron ores.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen moved closer, he noticed that the side of the lode was completely black, while it remained semi-transparent like a crystal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zeze, the little girl over there was wrong. These aren’t black iron ores at all, there are clearly black crystal ores,” Xuan-Yuan Xiang twitched her mouth and shook her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen did not mind that they were two different things, from his point of view…</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the ores were the same, since he didn’t know any of their uses at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He slowly sent celestial spiritual energy into his pickaxe and swung it down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The clear sound of an impact was heard. However, there wasn’t even so much as a crack on the face of the lode.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows, then used more spiritual energy as he brought the pickaxe down again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The counter force on his arms caused him to let go of the pickaxe. Ye Zichen looked at the ores in front of him in shock. </span><i><span style>I literally used all of my spiritual energy just now.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I, who am a mere step away from the Human Immortal level and had the enhancement of the Dragon Race’s Secret Manual…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Am actually unable to leave a mark on this lode?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ Yu smiled in satisfaction. </span><i><span style>Someone who hasn’t even reached the puny False Spiritual Body level actually wanted to work black iron ores.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ Yu smiled mockingly. </span><i><span style>Who told this guy to make up a lie to trick Lil’ Lan…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I’ll definitely make fun of him properly when he comes over.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, stop wasting time with it. With your current strength, it is impossible for you to mine it,” Stone comforted him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shook his head with a smile, then picked up his pickaxe…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zeze, so stubborn,” Lil’ Yu sneered behind them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Stone glared fiercely at her, “Seriously, there’s something wrong with you sick woman. Where did Lil’ bro piss you off? He’d just arrived, and is very nice. Do you know how we got this lode? A part of it was due to him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“None of your business,” Lil’ Yu twitched her mouth, then snorted coldly in her heart. </span><i><span style>All lying men are terrible!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stood in front of the lode and scratched his head, then looked over towards Xuan-Yuan Xiang, who floated in midair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You said that this was black crystal ore or something?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, you really are impatient, and wouldn’t even wait for me to finish. Black crystal ore is a rather high-leveled ore in the Three Realms, it is very difficult to mine even for a complete stage Human Immortal,” Xuan-Yuan Xiang answered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was rather stunned after hearing that, “Then what should I do? Am I supposed to just leave it here and submit?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I swore to myself with such confidence that I would slap that woman’s face. If I submit, then wouldn’t that be slapping myself in the face instead?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“How is this submitting? Tell that girl to come over here, she can’t do anything to the ore either,” Xuan-Yuan Xiang shrugged.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Although that’s true… </span></i><span style>But Ye Zichen couldn’t accept it…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sat his lips and sat cross-legged on the floor, then brought his phone out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ignoring whether he could mine it or not, even if he could, it would waste too much time if he just used his spiritual energy to scratch it bit by bit. Work… should be efficient.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen opened WeChat, and clicked on Yue Lao’s profile to send a message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yue Lao!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The industrial factories Ye Zichen had sent to the Heavenly Court were already started running, and naturally, Yue Lao was the person in charge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not only did the factories displease the Jade Emperor, it actually caused Yue Lao to be praised.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The factories solved many of the Heavenly Court’s unemployment issues, so the workers in the factories all worked very hard…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, only the food processing plants had been started due to Ye Zichen’s decision.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao’s phone buzzed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao, who was currently inspecting the factory, immediately walked over to an area without anyone else and replied when he saw who the message was from.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm. Our factories have already started up, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yep,” Yue Lao smiled as he looked over at the busy workers. “According to what you have said, only the food processing plant has started up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good,” Ye Zichen nodded with a smile, then raised his eyebrows. “Go and take a look at the manufacturing guide I gave you and find the chemical industry section. See if there is something on explosives.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Explosives?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao raised his eyebrows in confusion, then took out the manufacturing guide and flipped over to the chemical industry section.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long after, he replied once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yep.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Great.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled when he saw Yue Lao’s reply, then typed out his response.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Find a few technical workers to produce some explosives for me. I have an urgent use for them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem,” with that, Yue Lao immediately hurried over to find a few technical workers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time Yue Lao’s message came through, Lil’ Yu appeared behind Ye Zichen and snorted. “Do you think that the ores will jump out by themselves when you just sit here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately frowned unhappily when he felt the hostility in her words.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I don’t remember ever offending this woman. Why is she speaking like that and picking on me?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen licked his lips, then stood up from the ground and patted the dust off his pants with a shrug, “No need for you to worry. How I’m going to work is my problem.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But you not working is affecting our village’s mining progress,” Lil’ Yu continued to snort. “Don’t forget, you guys have a mission target of ten kilograms. If you can’t even reach that, then you won’t even get dinner.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I told you already. No need for you to worry. Just go back to being an overseer, alright?” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes at Lil’ Yu then ignored her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ Yu frowned, then snatched the pickaxe from Ye Zichen’s hand while he was off-guard, then swung it down to the black crystal ore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had wanted to make Ye Zichen feel ashamed, but…</span></p>
 <p><span style>No reaction.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>You deserve it!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen laughed coldly in his heart, but did not reveal any special reaction. He then snatched the pickaxe back and sneered, “Overseer, can you stop messing around here!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ Yu was extremely confused right now. </span><i><span style>That shouldn’t have happened. I am on the complete stage Spiritual Body level, and am the strongest in the village.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Although black iron ores are rather dense, it should not affect people of my level from mining it.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Did I apply my force too quickly?</span></i><span style> Lil’ Yu thought to herself. Even at that very moment, she still thought the lode was a black iron lode, mainly because she doesn’t even dare to imagine it being a black crystal lode…</span></p>
 <p><span style>If those were black crystal ores, then it was no longer an issue of whether the Spiritual Breeze Village could mine it. They might even face extermination if they dared to claim it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ Yu turned around and walked off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Ye Zichen’s phone buzzed again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, the explosives have been produced. Should I send them over to you right now?”</span></p>
