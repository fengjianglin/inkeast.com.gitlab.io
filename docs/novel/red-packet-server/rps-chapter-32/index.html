 <p><span style>Chapter 32 – Leveling the affability level</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Ye Zichen felt that warm body in his arms, he reached out his hand and patted Xiao Yumei’s back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mei-jie, you heard it all?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled gently. Yet, he saw Xiao Yumei suddenly look up and bite his lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your affability level with Xiao Yumei increased by 50, current affability level: 145.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your affability level with Xiao Yumei increased by 50, current affability level: 195.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your affability level with Xiao Yumei increased by 50, current affability level: 245.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style> Ye Zichen didn’t know how many times the affability level jumped up. Currently, he was completely immersed in Xiao Yumei’s warmth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Daddy, Mommy, Tiantian is hungry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as the two of them found it difficult to part, Lil’ Tiantian pulled on the corner of their clothes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, the two of them immediately parted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both of them looked at each other slightly awkwardly. Then, Xiao Yumei squatted down and picked Tiantian up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tiantian is hungry, Mommy will take Tiantian to eat something delicious.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Daddy come too.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmmm, let’s go,” Ye Zichen smiled, and put his finger on his lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Xiao Yumei saw his auction, she instantly looked at him for a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your affability level with Xiao Yumei increased by 5, current affability level: 500.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Affability level leveled up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Relationship status: Lovers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lovers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was shocked for a moment. The marriage string wouldn’t lie. Did it mean that the two of them truly became lovers?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>But this happened all too quickly, right?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He subconsciously looked at Xiao Yumei for a moment, and saw that Xiao Yumei was looking dazedly at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mei-jie.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t call me Mei-jie, you make me seem so old. How about calling me Yumei?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei blushed. She actually didn’t want to get related with Ye Zichen, she honestly felt like she wasn’t worthy of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she didn’t know why, but after knowing what he did for her…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her heart was uncontrollably attracted to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, she stopped forcing herself to be distant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just let nature take its course.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, Tiantian also liked him. That was more important than anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if she clearly knew that she couldn’t possibly stand by Ye Zichen’s side, then she’d just be the person behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yu-Yumei!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Daddy, Mommy, Tiantian is hungry!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tiantian’s sweet voice had a yelled out with a hint of displeasure. Hearing that, Ye Zichen and Xiao Yumei immediately rubbed her little head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, alright, we’ll go and eat now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The restaurant Ye Zichen chose was one of the restaurants under Glory Corporation. Actually, he didn’t have much of a choice, he had spent all the money on the mansion for his mother and still owed people a lot of money.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though he and Xiao Yumei were lovers now, he couldn’t bear spend a woman’s money.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Coincidentally, Xiao Hai had given him a VVVIP card, so he could eat for free. So why not?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Madam, sir, how many?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A family of three. Three people!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled. When Xiao Yumei heard from say “a family of three”, Xiao Yumei blushed, while her eyes were filled with joy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then this way, please…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t this the Riche Bro from our school?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A disharmonic voice suddenly sounded out, it caused Ye Zichen to rub his temples.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Such misfortune, why did he had to bump into these two even here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Qiang walked over in front of Ye Ziehen, while Yao Yue stayed beside him, and smiled towards the waiter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little bro waiter, your restaurant seems to be a high-class one. I understand him very well, he wouldn’t be able to afford the cost of here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yao Yue, we have split up already, why do you have to be so relentless?”</span></p>
 <p><span style> Ye Zichen felt helpless, he just didn’t get it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He never did anything to wrong his ex, the two already separated, why did she just have to pick on him and cause trouble every time she saw him?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who’s being relentless, I just want to remind this shop so that they don’t take any losses.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yao Yue continued ruthlessly with a cold laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Daddy, Tiantian is hungry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tiantian tugged on the corner of Ye Zichen’s shirt. Ye Zichen picked up her and pinched her cheek.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’re going to eat now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Daddy…” Yau Yue acted like she discovered a new continent and checked Ye Zichen and Xiao Yumei out. “It can’t be, you’re being a gigolo now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little girl, watch what you’re saying.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei couldn’t stand it anymore either, she could guess that Yao Yue should be Ye Zichen’s ex, but this ex was too much.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What, you’re unhappy now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yao Yue, shut up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Qiang roared. If Xiao Yumei hadn’t spoke, he wouldn’t have noticed her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although she was a young madam with a child, her appearance and body were top notch. Especially those alluring eyes, if he…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Qiang couldn’t help but lick his lips, then he shamelessly handed a name card towards Xiao Yumei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Beauty, let’s get to know each other.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Guo Qiang took out the name card, Yao Yue, who was on his side, froze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was hitting on someone else in front of her!</span></p>
 <p><span style>But she truly didn’t dare to say anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She could only stare fiercely at Xiao Yumei, hoping to tear her face apart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not interested.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei twitched her mouth in disdain and wrapped her arm around Ye Zichen’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Beauty, don’t get tricked by this brat, he’s just a poor piece of crap,” Guo Qiang advised. However, Xiao Yumei didn’t even look at him, “Zichen, how about we go eat somewhere else.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Qiang’s expression was a bit dark, he didn’t understand why Ye Zichen had such great luck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He thought that Yao Yue was very good already, he didn’t think that this brat actually found a young madam that was even sexier than Yao Yue after being dumped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why do we have to go somewhere else. We’ll eat here. You know that I don’t have the money to go somewhere else.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But I do,” Xiao Yumei smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t want to spend your money,” Ye Zichen rubbed his nose and handed a card from his pocket to the waiter. “I heard that this card can get stuff for free, is that so?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Supreme VIP card.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There seemed to be only three in the entire corporation, he didn’t think that he would ever see one here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir, your card is the Supreme VIP card of our corporation, with it you could enjoy the same treatment as our president.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait a minute, you’re saying that his is a Supreme VIP card?” Guo Qiang did not believe that Ye Zichen could take this sort of high-class card out. So he deliberated caused trouble, “Are you sure that isn’t fake?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“About this…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The waiter was a bit hesitant as well. After thinking about it for a moment, he replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir, it is my first time seeing a Supreme VIP card, may I get our manager to come over to have a look?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then go on, quickly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, the restaurant manager walked over speedily. He could help to not be quick after hearing that someone held the Supreme VIP card.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Which gentleman has the Supreme VIP card?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Here,” Ye Zichen handed the card over. With just a glance, the manager returned the card back respectfully, “Sir, if you please.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The manager’s action clearly proved the authenticity of this card. Ye Zichen nodded and held Xiao Yumei’s hand, and walked in while holding Lil’ Tiantian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Halfway in, he turned back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The possessor of this card would have the same treatment as the president, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir, that is correct.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then kick those two people out. They’re ruining my appetite.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled towards Guo Qiang and Yao Yue, then walked towards the room once again.</span></p>
