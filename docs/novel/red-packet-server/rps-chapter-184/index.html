 <p><span style>Chapter 184 – We’re rich!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had a speechless expression. He wanted to get mad, but he was too reluctant to do so when he saw how cute and slightly childish Xiao Yumei looked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised up his up to caress her hair, causing Xiao Yumei to open her eyes wide.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your arm…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s healed!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen lifted his right hand with a chuckle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To be honest, the healing medicine from the Heavenly Court was incredible. A bone fracture was healed so quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ve healed?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei was stunned. The look in her eyes was instantly replaced by excitement as she lifted his hand and looked it all over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was instantly confused a bit by how huge her reaction was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You arm is completely fine! Is it all thanks to that pill just now!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm!” Ye Zichen nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can you get that sort of pill in large quantities?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Xiao Yumei’s expression heated up even more, Ye Zichen blanked out a little. Then, he nodded even though he didn’t quite understand what she was getting at.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He could indeed exchange for an item costing a hundred cultivation experience in large quantities with the speed at which he’s earning cultivation experience.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shoo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei, who was sitting beside him, leaped into his arms, then looked up at him with a scorching light in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, we’re rich!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>We’re rich?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Where did she get that idea from?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei ran several jewelry stores, and was a someone with a reputation in Bingcheng. </span><i><span style>Just why did she suddenly get so worked up?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen didn’t even dare to meet her pair of eyes that were blazing with a scorching look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei tapped Ye Zichen on his forehead when she saw his confused look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you so stupid!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How am I stupid? You just suddenly said that we’re rich, but why don’t I feel like we’re rich?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re so dumb,” Xiao Yumei glanced at him in annoyance and twitched her eyebrows. “Didn’t you just say that you are in contact with the deities? Then you got those pills from the deities as well, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although he bought the level one Healing Pill from the Treasure Shop, it was more or less the same as getting it from the deities.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Precisely. Zichen, why didn’t you tell me earlier?” Xiao Yumei sighed helplessly. “You’re holding a huge mountain of gold, you didn’t use it properly at all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How did I not use it properly?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen didn’t quite accept that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was working so hard to earn cultivation experience in order to exchange for a volume of Fiery Eyes of Truth so that he could get rich.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tell me how you used it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei had a natural nose for business possiblities.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had already noticed infinite possibilities from Ye Zichen’s brief worlds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You just mentioned the Heavenly Court. Although I’m not sure what the Heavenly Court is like, but the stuff that the deities eat is definitely beneficial for us mortals, right!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s true.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Things from the Heavenly Court definitely brought great benefits to mortals.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then that’s right!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen could also feel a large door slowly opening from the conversation just now. However, it still felt a bit blurry for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why do you still not understand?” Xiao Yumei sighed with a frown. “Why did I fall for a little idiot like you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t have much talent for business. It’s not like you don’t know this, so just say whatever you want to say directly. Why did you say that I’m little? What’s more, am I little?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk,” Xiao Yumei snorted, she could naturally understand the meaning behind Ye Zichen’s teasing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We can sell the stuff from the Heavenly Court to the outside world.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows when he heard that, “Actually, I’ve thought about selling the treasures from the Heavenly Court to others.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then why didn’t you do that!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How am I supposed to?” Ye Zichen shrugged. “Was I supposed to take out Chinese cabbage from the Heavenly Court and run over to the circle of millionaires to tell them that this is cabbage from the Heavenly Court, so eating it would let them live longer? Isn’t there something wrong with me!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My little man, why are you dumb in such a cute way!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei bent down to pinch Ye Zichen’s cheeks with her hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll telling you the truth, okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, Ye Zichen did think about all this. He had even thought about asking Xiao Hai to find a way to advertise it for him, but in the end, he chose to reject all of his ideas.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of this was too strange, it wasn’t workable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Older Sis isn’t telling you to advertise Chinese cabbage, we only need to create a selling path for one of the treasures.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what are we going to use!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The healing pill you used just now,” Xiao Yumei directly explained in order to prevent Ye Zichen asking more. “There will always be accidents, and getting hurt is hard to avoid. Let’s take your arm for example, it would take at least a bit more than a month for it to heal under the treatment of the hospital, and even after that, you will still need to go through recovery treatments. However, your pill can decrease the healing time by several weeks. You should get it now, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s not that workable. My celestial pill doesn’t cure any wounds by eating it. That would be too miraculous, it is hard to avoid it attracting attention.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei licked her lips sexily, “Rarity!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But we have no reputation, are you sure that someone will use it after we introduce this pill? I think we can’t compare up to hospitals,” Ye Zichen raised another issue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, Xiao Yumei smiled, “Idiot, can just anyone go to the hospital?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei’s words instantly made Ye Zichen understand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you saying that you want to advertise it in the hidden people?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not only them. Even those that can be exposed would still need our pill.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Ye Zichen subconsciously looked around the VIP room, then lowered his voice, “You even want to introduce it to the military? That’s not so good. What if the higher ups start investigating!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What can we do about it? We’ll deal with it a step at a time. What’s more, if we can truly provide this sort of miraculous pill, the higher ups can't be happier. We would be working for the country. Little idiot, do you understand now? Of course, even if we want to introduce it to them, we have to gain a bit of reputation. What’s more, I’ve waited for this day for too long!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A smile of anticipation and grudge suddenly surfaced on Xiao Yumei’s beautiful face…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The capital. One day, I’ll be back.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Yumei, are you okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei had an expression of excitement just now, but the moment she finished speaking , her expression had changed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m fine, my little man,” Xiao Yumei rubbed Ye Zichen’s face with a joyous smile. “Knowing you must be the luck I’ve gained in my previous life.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you suddenly so intimate?” Ye Zichen shrunk his neck a little. Then, he suddenly realized another problem. “Yumei, I don’t have any issues with the pills. I’m able to provide them in large quantities. But how are we going to introduce them? We don’t know those sorts of people, and making some delinquents introduce it isn’t quite going to work.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who said we don’t know anyone?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A light flashed across Xiao Yumei’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Remember Hu-ge?”</span></p>
