 <p><span style>Chapter 525 – Got into huge trouble</span></p>
 <p><span style>After more discussion with Shi Qian, Ye Zichen had found out that he had been alone ever since he had arrived in the Immortal Region.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen did not ask too much about his life before that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He really wasn’t sure what he was going to do if Shi Qian is truly the Shi Qian mentioned in the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Margin" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style>Water Margin</span></a><span style>.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Yang Jian and Canopy Marshal chose to stay in the Immortal Region for three days. During so, Ye Zichen did question why they weren't in a hurry to return to the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>We asked for sick leave.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>That was the answer Yang Jian, who was eating a melon, gave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, they ended up staying in Spiritual Breeze Village.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Due to that, the two of them naturally took on the task of teaching the villagers about cultivation upon themselves. Even the cultivation of Master Li, who Zuo Mo had asked to stay in the village, begun to raise under Yang Jian and Canopy Marshal’s guidance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During this period of time, Ye Zichen only had one thing on his mind.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Should I establish my own power or not?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Being a general in a time of chaos was far safer than being a civilian. The main reason being that a general would be able to defend himself when the enemy attacks, while his soldiers could also help him out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Ye Zichen wasn’t currently in a time of chaos, he knew the Demon Realm would attack in the future. What’s more, he also needed to go to the Demon Realm to save Xiao Yumei. In that case, he had begun to feel like he had to become that “general”.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, that’s where the problem lies. </span><i><span style>Just where am I supposed to get the money to establish my own force?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I had Maintaining Beauty Corporation to do that in the Modern Realm, but now…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>The Treasure Tower?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Don’t joke around. Although our relationship is rather special, I can’t exactly ask her for money. Even if Zuo Mo is willing to give the money to me, then who would the power belong to?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, Ye Zichen felt very troubled…</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, he needed reputation to establish power, as well as a reason for others to follow him. Just having money was definitely not enough. At the very least, he needed a reason for others to follow him contentedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was why Ye Zichen began to think about pill refining.</span></p>
 <p><span style>According to what he knew about the Three Realms, pill refiners were extremely valued existences. What’s more, high leveled pill refiners would always have a lot of experts following him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most importantly, pill refiners were all rich!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Mo had once told him that amazing pill refiners wouldn’t have any less resources when compared to the Treasure Tower as a whole.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Lord Taishang is definitely a good choice, but this geezer simply refuses to teach me!” Ye Zichen scratched his head as he sat on the bed, while his phone was placed in front of him. “Ahh, let me try once again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen thought about it for a long time, then finally made up his mind to have a good chat with Old Lord Taishang once again.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>As long as I use both </span></i><a href="https://pathosethoslogos.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><span style>pathos and ethos</span></i></a><i><span style>…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>The old man will definitely be moved.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clicked open his WeChat, but before he went over to find Old Lord Taishang, he saw a lot of people had sent messages towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Sky Sovereign, you screwed me over!</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Fortune: Sky Sovereign, what you did was not right.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: What’s going on?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha: The group exploded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: Big bro, the group exploded. Hurry up and take a look, the great deities of the Heavenly Court are all in trouble.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was rather confused from all the private messages. He could only click into the Red Packet Server.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Utter silence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The most recent message was from over half an hour ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was a situation that was completely out of the norm for a group as popular as the Red Packet Server. Normally, it was possible to reach 999+ new messages in a mere ten minutes, not to mention thirty.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What happened here? </span></i><span style>Ye Zichen scratched his head and scrolled up, then saw…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jade Emperor entered the group by scanning the QR code.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This… should be huge trouble, right?” Ye Zichen muttered. Since Jade Emperor entered with his main account, then it was almost definitely because God of Thunder, God of Fortune and co. had angered Little Prince way too much.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s why the Jade Emperor directly entered with his main account in a fit of rage…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen took a look at the subsequent chat history…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jade Emperor: @everyone, come out!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: Greetings to Jade Emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha: Hello, Uncle Jade Emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Barefoot Immortal: Oh my god, why did the monarch enter as well? This group is seriously popular!</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Fortune: Greetings, supervisor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Boss, why did you come? Oh yeah @Little Prince. Supervisor, this grandson is pretending to be you all the time. I told him enter with his main but he refuses to. Hurry up and banish him to the mortal realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Fortune: Yeah, yeah, yeah. This grandson…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jade Emperor: Hehe!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jade Emperor: Laozi is Little Prince. Leizhenzi, Zhao Gongming, didn’t you two ask this emperor to enter with my main?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jade Emperor: Say something. C’mon!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though Ye Zichen wasn’t present when Jade Emperor sent the message, he was able to imagine the atmosphere of the group at the time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was definitely utter silence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jade Emperor: Calling me grandson, grandson every single day was fun wasn’t it? Leizhenzi, what exactly are you capable of? Zhao Gongming, didn’t you say you’re not going to give laozi my year end bonus?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jade Emperor: Say it one more time!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at the time the message was sent, then looked at the time all of the deities sent him the private messages. </span><i><span style>It seems like this was when they sent it all.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>There’s no need for me to read the rest of the chat history. Jade Emperor is definitely pissed, and blabbered on in the group.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>The other deities naturally did not dare to anger him even more, so they all stopped chatting.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>That’s why the group became silent.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen closed the window. </span><i><span style>Other people are one thing, but I really feel sorry towards God of Thunder and God of Fortune. But what I even do? Jade Emperor didn’t let me tell anyone.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen licked his lips, then sent a message to God of Thunder in a testing manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he sent a message towards God of Fortune.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, you really screwed us over hard,” God of Fortune replied instantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait, what’s the situation over there for you guys?” Ye Zichen smiled coyly as he sent the message. </span><i><span style>But I suppose there was no need for me to ask.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>How is it even possible for it to be good now that Jade Emperor has been angered so much!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Leizhenzi is chatting with the Jade Emperor inside. I’m waiting outside the palace, and it seems like it’ll be my turn soon. Sky Sovereign, we aren’t on bad terms, right? Since you knew that he’s the Jade Emperor, why didn’t you tell us?” God of Fortune truly wanted to cry. He actually swore at his own boss.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, it was the big boss! Isn’t that just asking for it!?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I already reminded you guys, and told you not to argue with Little Prince. You guys didn’t listen!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Ye Zichen sent that, he saw Yang Jian and Zhu Ganglie dip their heads and appear at the entrance to his room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It can’t be, did the Jade Emperor seek the two of you out as well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No,” Yang Jian said in a depressed manner. “But someone told us that Little Prince is the Jade Emperor. Old Pig and I seem to have argued with him before, so we’re going to hurry back and ask for our punishment!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Canopy Marshal did not say anything, but his resentful-filled eyes…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>You were screwing us over right!?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>He’s definitely thinking that.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, I don’t know whether we can meet again after I return to the Heavenly Court this time, but it is definitely my honor to have become your sworn brother,” Yang Jian said as if he was saying his last words. “Bro, I’m in heaps of trouble this time. Ha… If I really end up falling… Remember to burn a few bottles of Erguotou, then burn a few doujins for me. Don’t let me be too lonely!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Yang Jian grabbed Canopy Marshal’s shoulder. “We’re off!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait a moment,” just as they were about to leave, Ye Zichen suddenly blurted out. “I’ll go back with you guys!”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Original Chapter Teaser:</strong>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Maybe it really is time to establish my own power. Even though I do have the identity of the reincarnation of the Yellow Emperor, and some big shots in the Immortal Region seems to recognize that, I doubt all of them will, especially when a lot of them held onto power for such a long time already.</p>
 <p>In order to defend against the demons, we will need power. The Three Realms pretty much have to work together properly in order to even have a chance, and... That isn't happening any time soon.</p>
 <p>In that case, I need to establish my own power to try and influence the way things go. My connections with the deities will be able to held in that regard, but I can't just rely on them forever. It's not like they will be willing to put aside grudges and ignore orders just due to their friendship with me.</p>
 <p>Well, I suppose there is Zuo Mo. But... I cannot rely on her and the Treasure Tower forever. That's not mine. I need my own power, and right now... Shi Qian might be a perfect candidate for me to start with.</p>
