 <p><span style>Chapter 428 – Plead</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Wei Chen followed Ye Zichen into the Maintaining Beauty Corporation building and saw the barrier that had been bit open, his eyebrows immediately locked together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you think?” Ye Zichen glanced at Wei Chen, since he was completely ignorant of how to fix it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss Ye, can you tell me the situation back then?” Wei Chen looked up and asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen described what he saw to Wei Chen simply, while also describing some of the more important events in detail.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Wei Chen’s eyebrows knitted closely together, “So it’s actually like that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? Is it very troublesome?” Ye Zichen frowned. Wei Chen’s expression was the expression he wanted to see the least, because it was as if trouble would arise once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s not very troublesome, it can be fixed with just normal celestial spiritual energy. I just never expected that the abyssals would have evolved to the point of being able to digest and absorb the barrier. Actually, before I arrived, I saw plenty of places with demonic energy in the Modern Realm… How about this, Boss Ye, go and keep doing what you need to do and leave all this to me!” Wei Chen answered plainly. However, Ye Zichen felt from Wei Chen’s gaze that it wasn’t as simple as Wei Chen made it sound.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, since Wei Chen didn’t want to talk about it, Ye Zichen wasn’t going to ask either. He had no interest in looking for trouble. Of course… If trouble really sought him out, then he would not be afraid either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen patted Wei Chen’s shoulders, then smiled, “Then I’ll trouble you. If you need any help, then just tell me directly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen left the Otherworld and returned to the company, he immediately went over to Li Shuang’s office. There, he saw that the two women were sitting together and checking out clothes and bags on the internet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re back,” Xiao Yumei stood up with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen glanced at the screen of the laptop, then raised his eyebrows with a smile, “Wow, as the management, you are actually not working properly and actually went to check out shopping websites.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? You’re going to fire me?” Xiao Yumei smirked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing her slightly cute look, Ye Zichen raised his hand and pinched her cheek, “You’re still asking even though you know!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He caressed her hair once again, then stretched lazily, “I have other matters to deal with. I’ll come and find you when I’m free!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, a look of sadness flashed across Xiao Yumei’s face. However, she still nodded with a smile, “Okay, then go and busy yourself!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sorry, I’ll spend more time with you guys after I deal with everything,” Ye Zichen reached out and pulled Xiao Yumei into his arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The beauty smiled and shook her head, “I know that, so don’t worry. Right now, the company is getting stronger day by day. Even if you want to take me out, I wouldn’t have the time!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Xiao Yumei lifted her chin proudly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, Ye Zichen shook his head, then turned around to leave after a bit more chitchat with them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, what he did not know was that Xiao Yumei’s delicate face turned depressed the moment he left once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She walked next to Li Shuang with a sigh, then yanked the laptop over. Although her gaze was upon the clothes and bags on the screen, her heart was completely depressed.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I keep on feeling like the distance between us is getting greater. But all I can do is to make myself walk forward at a faster space, and don’t let you forget me.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Back at the mansion, Ye Zichen directly returned to his bedroom. The moment he entered, he locked the room door, while calling out Xuan-Yuan Xiang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you have something you wanted to tell me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm… You could tell?” Xuan-Yuan Xiang stretched lazily, then suddenly pointed at the phone in his pocket. “But before that, shouldn’t you handle the stuff on your end?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen took out his phone in confusion. Only then did he notice that he already had 99+ messages on WeChat, and most of it was from his Red Packet Server.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal Did you guys get the news?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang: Got it. What has been supporting Taibai for all these years was that that desire. So after Yang Jian told him the news, he might have finally made up his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: It’s all my fault.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: The message was sent, but even if we descend to the lower world, it would be on that geezer Jade Emperor's orders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Fortune: Why didn’t I get it?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: You aren’t a combatant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: What use is finding you, someone with negative combat abilities.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang: The pretty nice Immortality Peach Feast actually ended like it did. It seems like Taibai Jinxing really can’t endure it anymore. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have spoken like that!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was rather confused from the messages in the group, even if he begun from the bottom, he was still unable to comprehend what exactly has happened!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Isn’t the Heavenly Court holding the Immorality Peach Feast right now? Why did they suddenly…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Did the Immortality Peach Feast end? What are you guys talking about?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sent the message in confusion. The other people immediately started to respond, and Old Lord Taishang….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, I’m so sorry. I actually didn’t believe you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang was clearly talking about the black silk stockings, and since Ye Zichen was no petty person, he had already thought of it as the past already.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What he was curious about was the things they were talking about in the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let bygones be bygones. What were you guys talking about in the group just now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sigh….” Yang Jian sighed. “Bro, you have no idea! Just now, when we’ve pretty much all given our gifts, the Queen Mother began to ask us what we want. Logically speaking, we naturally want a Peach of Immortality, but that geezer, Taibai Jinxing…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He asked the Jade Emperor to go to war against the demon race!” the monkey added.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That geezer, Taibai Jinxing, is truly brave. He actually spoke like that in that sort of situation. Isn’t he clearly trying to force the Jade Emperor’s hand!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“We all received message from Taibai Jinxing, and I don’t think it’s just us. Other war gods probably received the message as well… Which was Taibai Jinxing asking us to aid him!” Canopy Marshal also added.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After that, Yue Lao spoke up, “That’s the thing. The Immortality Peach Feast ended prematurely. The Jade Emperor left like he was very angry, and the other deities all returned home.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Going to war against the demon race is a huge deal. As the supreme leader of the Heavenly Court, the Jade Emperor naturally had a lot to consider.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But Taibai Jinxing’s act of forcing him to do something directly pushed him into a situation, so it was no wonder that he would leave in anger.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>However, nobody probably hated the demon race as much as Taibai Jinxing after what he went through, so it was understanding that he would be so desperate.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shook his head and couldn’t help but ask.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How’s Taibai Jinxing now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Him?” Old Lord Taishang shook his head with a wry smile. “He probably went to the Cloud Palace of the Golden Arches to plead with the Jade Emperor!”</span></p>
