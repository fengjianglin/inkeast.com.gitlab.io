 <p><span style>Chapter 537 – I Want Your Position as the Master of the Heavenly Court</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Canopy Marshal blurted out, Yang Jian slapped his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shhh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Fortune, God of Thunder and co. immediately surrounded Taibai Jinxing, then glanced towards the Jade Emperor before asking, “Taibai, why did you come up here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you guys so nervous? What can the Jade Emperor do to me even if he sees me?” Taibai Jinxing smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder snorted in response to Taibai Jinxing’s carefree expression, “Don’t just make the assumption because you guys were on good terms before. Right now, you basically betrayed the Heavenly Court. If you get caught by the Jade Emperor…. Hmmph.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though God of Thunder didn’t finish his words, his meaning was obvious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, I understand,” Taibai Jinxing maintained his carefree expression. “I’ve already understood the Jade Emperor’s personality very well. To be honest, he really isn’t suitable to be the master of the Heavenly Court any longer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shh!” Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King Li immediately covered his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder also gulped, “Are you seeking death!? This is the Heavenly Court and you actually said that! If the Jade Emperor finds out, then it’s one thing he kills you, but he’ll take his anger out on us as well!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, Geezer Taibai, you got a lot braver after going out!” Yang Jian twitched his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Look at how scared you guys are,” Taibai Jinxing pushed Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King Li’s hand away and frowned. “It’s not that I got braver, it’s that you guys got more cowardly. After so many years of peaceful days, you guys are starting to take each day leisurely, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder and co. turned silent. It actually wasn’t their fault.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most of the deities in the Heavenly Court were like that. The lack of war naturally caused people to relax. There had been nobody who dared to challenge the Heavenly Court’s might for several hundred thousand years, and even the heavenly soldiers who used to train daily at the South Heaven’s Gate no longer trained so. That was because they truly relaxed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your mindsets will be the death of you,” Taibai Jinxing frowned. “Never mind, there is no point in me speaking too much. I merely came over to remind you guys to be careful of the Count of the Wind and Lord of the Rain!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh yeah, you just said Count of the Wind and Lord of the Rain… Do you know something!?” Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King Li raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I did try to scry, but I couldn’t see everything too clearly. I merely came here because I was worried about you old friends. I also have some things I want to tell Ye Zichen. Help me…” Before Taibai Jinxing could finish, Jade Emperor suddenly walked over from behind them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When did you arrive?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Yang Jian and co. heard those words, they immediately froze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They turned around and smiled, “We’ve arrived for some time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh? If there someone else behind you guys? He’s actually not coming to greet this emperor?” Jade Emperor frowned, then walked towards the place behind them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sweat begun to appear on all of the deity’s foreheads. </span><i><span style>If we let Jade Emperor see Taibai Jinxing right now…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, a pleasant melody sounded out through the night. Jade Emperor stopped in his tracks, then looked towards the stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder and co. also let out a long sigh of relief, then signaled Taibai Jinxing to quickly leave with his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We can talk in detail some time. You better hurry away in this situation. Otherwise, it’ll be hard to deal with if Jade Emperor turns around,” Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King Li also turned around and whispered to Taibai Jinxing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taibai Jinxing glanced over at the Jade Emperor, then nodded, “Then see you in the Immortal Region.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the deities clearly over thought about everything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment the melody sounded out and the Seven Fairies descended from the clouds, the entire crowd went wild.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jade Emperor looked intently down at the stage. To be honest, if the girls were not his daughters…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He would definitely want to take them into his harem as his concubines.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stood in the backstage with a smile, and watched on as the Seven Fairies performed at their finest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t hard for Ye Zichen to notice from the expressions of the deities that his visual feast was a success.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received the praise of the Golden Boy and Jade Girl. Reputation +1.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received Iron Crutch Li’s praise. Reputation +1.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received Han Xiangzi’s admiration. Reputation +10.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>System notifications continued popped up on Ye Zichen’s phone. During a concert of a short two hours, Ye Zichen actually received over three thousand Reputation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His ranking on the Reputation Leaderboard of the Three Realms also rose continuously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It finally stopped when it reached 10</span><span style>th</span><span style> place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the final song ended, all of the deities of the Heavenly Court were shocked. The performance was truly a visual feast for them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, Ye Zichen was not the only person who benefitted from the concert…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Seven Fairies also gained a lot of fans with the concert, which also turned into the Enhancement of Belief. Under the enhancement of such a power, their strength also increased.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the concert ended, all of the deities left unsatiated. Ye Zichen was certain that in the following days, all of the chitchat in the Heavenly Court would be about the Heavenly Court’s first girl band’s performance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Three days later in the Cloudy Palace of the Golden Arches.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign Nameless truly did not disappoint this emperor,” the face of Jade Emperor, who sat upon his throne, was filled with smiles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For some reason, when he saw the Jade Emperor’s joyous look, he couldn’t help but get reminded of the smile of foolish emperors in historical dramas when they received a toy they like.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign won the bet this time, so this emperor will naturally keep my word and void God of Thunder and co.’s punishment,” Jade Emperor waved his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder and co. all walked up and gave their thanks, “Thank you, your majesty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, if you’re going to thank, then it would be better for you to thank Sky Sovereign. He was the one who saved you guys.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Fortune, God of Thunder, Yang Jian and Canopy Marshal’s intimacy level shot up, and only stopped when it neared Respected.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen maintained a soft smile as he stood on the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jade Emperor chuckled, “Sky Sovereign is truly capable. You actually managed to make a show so brilliant. Sky Sovereign is truly talented!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty is flattering me. I merely did it randomly,” Ye Zichen cupped his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign is too humble. If that was just you doing it randomly, then just what would it be like if you made it amazing? Is Sky Sovereign interested in staying in the Heavenly Court? This emperor can give you a position that is above all but one, grant you the constitution of a celestial being, and allow you to enjoy endless wealth.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was clear that Ye Zichen’s concert had gain the Jade Emperor’s favor, and invoked the Jade Emperor’s talent loving heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen merely smiled and did not reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, no problem. This emperor will give Sky Sovereign some time to think. Oh yeah, this emperor had promised Sky Sovereign a huge gift at the time. I wonder what does Sky Sovereign desire?” Jade Emperor smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s smile also drastically changed, “Is anything okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course. As long as Sky Sovereign wants it, this emperor will definitely satisfy you,” Jade Emperor replied like he was willing to offer anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded, then asked, “Then… What if I asked you for your position as the master of the Heavenly Court?”</span></p>

 <p></p>
 <p><b>God of Thunder:&nbsp;</b>What the heck are you doing here!?</p>
 <p><strong>God of Fortune:&nbsp;</strong>Taibai, are you insane? What if the Jade Emperor catches you?</p>
 <p><strong>Taibai Jinxing:&nbsp;</strong>He won't.</p>
 <p><strong>Erlang Shen:&nbsp;</strong>But what if!? My uncle is a petty guy.</p>
 <p><strong>Taibai Jinxing:&nbsp;</strong>Ha, just look at him, there's no way he's going to catch me.</p>
 <p><strong>God of Thunder:&nbsp;</strong>What do you mean?</p>
 <p><strong>Taibai Jinxing:&nbsp;</strong>You see his expression? That's the exact same one that Canopy Marshal has when he looks at girls.</p>
 <p><strong>Zhu Bajie:&nbsp;</strong>Hey! What's that supposed to mean!?</p>
 <p><strong>God of Fortune:</strong>&nbsp;Still! Shhh, don't be so noisy. We don't want him catching you. If he does, not only are you going to get thrown into the dungeon, we're going to all get punished too!</p>
