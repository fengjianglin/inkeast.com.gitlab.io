 <p><span style>Chapter 570 – The Enraged Su Liu’er</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen!” The beautiful figure roared angrily like a madman, while she released her spiritual pressure around her continuously, causing all of those at the Human Immortal level or below to cough up a mouthful of blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are you!?” Yang Jian stepped forward with a frown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman in front of him was too terrifyingly strong. Even he felt an intense sense of danger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other people all looked towards the lady.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The lady squinted her eyes, and looked towards Yang Jian, “That’s none of your business. Now, where is Ye Zichen?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master of the Fox Yaos,” the dragon elder took a step forward and raised his eyebrows. “I wonder what business do you have with little friend Ye?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dragon, you seem to know where Ye Zichen is. Tell me, or else I will commence the slaughter!” The lady frowned at the dragon elder’s question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Iron Bull twitched his mouth, “This girlie is rather bold. Slaughter? Who do you think you can handle here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re too loud!” The woman sent a ray of cold air towards Iron Bull.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within mere moments, Iron Bull, who Yang Jian and co. had trouble defeating as a group, was frozen into an ice sculpture.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The surrounding people couldn’t help but raise their eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They could sense that the woman’s cold aura had nearly reached the level of an Immortal King.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Speak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bone-chilling cold air filled the surroundings. Although it was not targeting anyone, everyone couldn’t help but muster up spiritual energy to defend against it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Liu’er-jie,” a charming voice called out from the air, and an armored man with a staff stood next to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yuan Hong,” Yang Jian revealed a surprised expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man also raised his eyebrows, “Big Brother Yang Jian.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have no time for your chitchat. Tell me… Where is Ye Zichen!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Liu’er’s face was covered in a cold expression as a thunderous noise sounded out in the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Liu’er-jie.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll ask one final time. Where. Is. Ye. Zichen!” Su Liu’er stared intently in front of her, while her dark pupils were slowly turning into a crystallized blue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuan Hong couldn’t help but gulp when he saw this. Then, he turned towards Yang Jian, “Big Brother Yang Jian, where exactly is Little Brother Ye? Hurry up and say it. If Liu’er gets angry, no one in the entire Beast Region dares to try and calm her down!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He already entered Mount Supreme,” Yang Jian shrugged. “You guys were just a tad bit too late. If you were ten minutes earlier, he’d still be here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damn it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Liu’er stomped, causing a huge crack to appear on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yuan Hong nudged Su Zhu on her shoulders and gave her a cue. Su Zhu nodded, and just when she wanted to approach her older sister…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Move!” Su Liu’er roared angrily. Everyone in the surroundings subconsciously made way for her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Break!” Su Liu’er punched onto the seal. The powerful rebound effect caused her to cough up a mouthful of blood. Yet, she completely disregarded her injuries and rained punches onto the seal like a madman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Say, even if you continue like this until next year, you might not be able to open it,” Yang Jian couldn’t help but speak up. “This is a seal left by a supreme, you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shut up!” Su Liu’er wiped away the blood from the corner of her mouth, then charged towards the seal once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, the rebound seemed even more powerful, causing Su Liu’er to stagger a bit before climbing back up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sis, don’t you,” Su Zhu hugged her from behind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Su Liu’er clenched her teeth, while blood dripped from the corner of her mouth to the ground, “I have to destroy this seal. I have to capture Ye Zichen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But, we can’t break this seal!” Su Zhu smiled wryly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We have to break it even if we can’t. Or else, what’s are we going to do about lil’ sis!” Su Liu’er stared at the seal, then snorted. “I’m definitely going to shatter this seal!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoosh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Ye Zichen entered the cave, he was directly teleported into a hall within what seemed to be a palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems like everyone lands in different places,” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows, then looked around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From what he could see, the people who he entered with were not around. He was the only person within the palace hall, and it was so quiet that when he walked around, he was able to hear the echo of his own footsteps.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Welcome to this old man’s kingdom of games,” an ancient voice sounded out throughout the palace. Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows. </span><i><span style>This is should be the who left Mount Supreme behind, but just what exactly does kingdom of games mean? </span></i><span style>“There are twenty-three participants each time. It’s slightly different to what this old man had envisioned, but is more interesting this way with odd numbers. Starting from right now, you have three days to form your teams. The method of that is very simple. &nbsp;Each one of you should have a jade pendant in front of where you are.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked up, and saw that there was indeed a white jade pendant glowing not so far away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen picked up the jade pendant. It was slightly cold, and the moment he touched it, he instantly felt like he was a lot calmer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So it actually has the effect of clearing the mind!” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows. “But so many people entered. I actually expected less than fifteen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This pendant shall be the item for you to form your teams. Find your teammates and exchange it. The person who has not found a teammate after three days will fail, and be killed! Okay now, I wish you all a good time. I will tell you the next step after three days.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Killed!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s Mount Supreme trying to do!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“The Niflheim Dragon loved all sorts of games before becoming a god. He even treated the Heaven’s Will and fate itself as games. It isn’t surprising for him to be able to do this,” Xuan-Yuan Xiang came out of the sword with a smile. “I just didn’t expect the rules of his game to be so extreme. The losers will actually be killed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s he trying to do? Is he treating us like puppets?” Ye Zichen frowned. “He’s not treating our lives seriously at all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“At this level, he is already treating lives of other people like that of ants. He doesn’t care if a few people die in front of him. What’s more, cultivation is going against fate itself. The lives of every single successful person are piled with bones. If you die while testing your luck here… Then it can only mean that you weren’t lucky enough,” Xuan-Yuan Xiang smiled in response. It was clear that she didn’t feel like anything was wrong with the game.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I still feel like it isn’t right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Youngster,” Just as Ye Zichen held the white jade pendant in dissatisfaction, the voice transmission of an ancient voice sounded out in his mind. It was the person who gave the gaming instructions earlier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened?” Xuan-Yuan Xiang noticed the change in Ye Zichen’s expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shook his head to signal her to be quiet, then replied in his mind, “You’re talking to me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re very lucky to actually gain the map of this game, but you’re not the Chosen One. It really is a shame. In order to compensate you, you can choose right now. There are thirty of the best treasures in the God Realm in front of you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoosh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An altar covered in divine items suddenly appeared in front of Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Choose one and quit, or participate in the game to try and gain the final treasure. Of course, if you choose the latter, then you will face the danger of death like all the other contestants. Now… What is your decision?”</span></p>
