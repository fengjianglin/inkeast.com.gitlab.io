 <p><span style>Chapter 163 – Gifting a phone to Han Xiangzi</span></p>
 <p><span style>Three days passed in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s the Great Sage’s autograph! But Great Sage Sun’s handwriting is so ugly,” Xia Keke giggled and played around with the card in her hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen took a peek at the girl, “Keke, aren’t you curious at all?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Curious about what?” Xia Keke smiled, then placed the autograph into her pocket.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aren’t you curious about why someone in myths would appear in reality and even know me!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aiya, you’re talking about that,” Xia Keke smiled after a brief pause. “What’s there to be surprised about? I have always believed that Sun Wukong and the rest were real…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at her dumbly. He didn’t think that she was that sort of girl.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Was he supposed to call her naïve or…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But whatever, her not asking saved him the need to explain.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Why didn’t Su Yan come with you?” Ye Zichen asked as the two of them walked side by side on the streets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke revealed an annoyed look as she pouted, “What? Don’t you like that I called you out alone?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s not that.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This girl’s heart was truly like a needle under the sea, she would think all sort of things in an instant.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pinched her cheek, while Xia Keke spoke, “Susu said that it’s her grandpa’s birthday. Don’t you need to prepare a birthday present or something?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Old Man Su’s birthday.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was stunned for a bit. He really hadn’t heard of that. With his relationship with Old Man Su, he had to offer a birthday present no matter what.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t have any more monkey wine on hand, so he must remember to ask the Great Sage for a few gourds of it when he returned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t too much to ask for a few gourds of monkey wine when the Great Sage drank so much of his Wahaha, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Beep beep.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A car horn sound sounded out behind them. Ye Zichen and Xia Keke turned around, and saw a small buggy park on the side of the road behind them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Haoyu and Lin Ru ran over towards them side by side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Zichen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You know them?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke looked up in confusion. Ye Zichen nodded and revealed a faint look of helplessness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If there was no surprise, they came to find him for the Lin family’s old man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you guys came for Old Man Lin, then have nothing to talk about.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen spoke up first. Both Lin Lin’s mockery towards him and Lin Hanben’s desire to use force to make him stay had triggered Ye Zichen’s bottom line.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He’ll only go and save the Lin family’s old man if he’d gone crazy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wasn’t a saint, and didn’t possess the kind of heart that cared about the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Zichen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both of their expressions froze when they heard Ye Zichen’s words. They did come for Old Man Lin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lin Ru, Wu Haoyu, you guys can’t not know how Lin Haoben and Lin Lin treated me, right?” Ye Zichen frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ru bit her lips and said with a hint of apology, “Ye Zichen, I apologize to you on my second uncle’s and cousin’s behalf. Their actions were indeed too much, but my grandpa is innocent.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Man Lin is indeed innocent.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But I’m also innocent?” Ye Zichen pursed his lips with a smile, then put on an expression that showed “I can’t do anything”.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen!” Lin Ru roared, then shifted her gaze towards Xia Keke as she clenched her teeth. “If you help treat my grandpa, then I won’t tell Susu you’re cheating on her!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ru definitely struggled a lot to say that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had a personality that hated evil. If it was before, when she saw Ye Zichen be with other girls, she might have immediately slapped him for Su Yan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But for their family’s old man…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, don’t tell me that you just have a normal relationship with her,” Heavy suspicion rested in Lin Ru’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Ye Zichen shrugged helplessly, “Lin Ru, why are you so cute to threaten me using this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah! I am threatening you!” Lin Ru bit her lips, while she frowned. “Just go and save my grandpa!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but reply when he saw Lin Ru’s pitiful appearance, “Never mind, I don’t want to destroy our relationship due to this. How about this, if you want me to save Old Man Su, then fine! Tell Lin Hanben and Lin Lin to apologize to me in person.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, he left from Lin Ru’s sight while holding Xia Keke’s hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ru clenched her teeth and continuously waved her fist at Ye Zichen’s retreating back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That scum, he actually dared to betray Susu, he’s pissing me off!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Ru, the situation might not be what you think.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t speak for him. I had thought that he was a good person, I didn’t think that… Hmmph!” Lin Ru frowned. “After I trick him into treating my grandpa, I’ll definitely tell Susu to break up with him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Haoyu smiled wryly on the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Lin Ru also took out her phone and shouted, “Lin Lin, tell your dad that if you want Ye Zichen to save grandpa, he has to take you to apologize in person.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke shrugged speechlessly after taking a few steps away, “Who is that girl? She knows Susu?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She’s a good sis with Susu,” Ye Zichen smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Xia Keke twitched her mouth, “I don’t feel like their relationship is that good. If I saw this sort of situation, then I would definitely call Susu right away!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She can’t help it, due to her family’s old man’s situation, she has a favor to ask of me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“True,” Xia Keke blinked with her cute eyes. “Then what happened to their family’s old man?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s phone rang before he could reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your intimacy level with Han Xiangzi has increased by 50. Current intimacy level: 250.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows. The fact that the intimacy level increased meant that his technique of chatting up girls had a pretty good effect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lü Dongbin: Celestial sovereign, thank you!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was confused.</span></p>
 <p><em><span style>Why was Lü Dongbin talk to him? Shouldn’t it be Han Xiangzi?</span></em></p>
 <p><span style>Lü Dongbin: Celestial sovereign, I am Han Xiangzi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled when he saw the message. </span><i><span style>That makes sense!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems like Brother Han’s advances on Immortal Lady He worked pretty well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It wasn’t bad. At least I spoke out the words in my heart, and Immortal Lady He… She didn’t clearly refuse.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not refusing is a good thing,” Ye Zichen pursed his lips and smiled. “Brother Han should strike the iron while its hot.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great deity, what do you think I should do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was clear that Ye Zichen had become Han Xiangzi’s backbone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no helping it, the relationship that didn’t improve in a thousand years had a qualitative change after meeting Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Xiangzi couldn’t help but see Ye Zichen in a new light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen did want to teach him the following steps, but he felt rather strange as he stared at the Lü Dongbin profile pic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why is Brother Han using Great Deity Lü’s phone?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ai, don’t talk about it,” Han Xiangzi blushed. “When I got mad at great deity back then, I went and broke my phone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then buy a new one,” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows. “Otherwise, it really isn’t going to work if Brother Han keeps on chatting with me using Great Deity Lü’s phone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great deity, don’t you know that phones are rare items in the Heavenly Court...? I broke one earlier, and can’t afford another one right now.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Rare items.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye ZIchen raised his eyebrows and laughed softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I’ll gift you one.”</span></p>
