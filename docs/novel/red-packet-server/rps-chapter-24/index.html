 <p><span style>Chapter 24 - Take him away</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen turned his head back to look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a spherical object that had appeared at the entrance of the coffee shop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His forehead would be covered in sweat after only a few steps, it also looked like his body was weak, so it seemed like he needed some medicine to help with his kidney function.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Beauty, I came.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That Fatty had the accent of a foreigner, when it was accompanied by the large golden necklace and the large golden ring, it couldn’t help but cause Ye Zichen to think of the word “upstart”.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, didn’t you want to see my boyfriend? He is my boyfriend.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke blinked her large and cute eyes, and reached out her white finger and pointed. At the same time, Ye Zichen also stood up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The main reason of the fatty looking like a ball was due to his height.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the looks of it, he was only approximately 1.65 meters. Ye Zichen was 1.86 meters, so he was a head taller.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fatty, I heard that you want to pay to date my girlfriend? How much are you going to pay? Let me see if it’s worth it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Ye Zichen finished, Xia Keke pinched his waist.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>You came to help me stop him, what are you saying that for!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen stood up, the fatty was a bit worried. However, after hearing what he said, his green pea-like eyes flashed with contempt.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>A poor student is always going to be a poor student!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Brat, you want money, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry if I want money or what. I’m just asking you, how much are you paying?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fatty raised five fingers.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Fifty thousand!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen subconsciously glanced at Xia Keke, he didn’t think that this girlie was worth so much, fifty thousand…</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was the price of a not very famous escort.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke bit her lips, did this guy actually listen to what she had said?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why did she feel like she jumped from a skillet into a fire pit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As expected…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You want to pay to date my girlfriend with fifty thousand. Just look at her body, her curves, what’s more, she’s a talented student in Polytechnic University, she is an existence of both beauty and intelligence, you actually want to pay only fifty thousand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then how much do you want?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Five hundred thousand. If you can pay five hundred thousand for my girlfriend, then I’ll let you have her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen waved his hand generously, but the fatty’s eyes turned green upon hearing that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Impossible.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If it’s Impossible, then f*ck off, don’t try to pay to date a university student. Idiot.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen showed an expression of contempt. The fatty squinted his eyes, “Alright, little bro, don’t you just want money? To be honest, I pity this beauty quite a bit, she actually had a boyfriend like you. How about this, I’ll pay two hundred thousand, that was the price of a third-rated celebrity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Two hundred thousand…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen hesitated a bit. When the fatty saw this, the despise in his eyes became even more obvious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A poor student was a poor student indeed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a long time…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Deal!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen directly agreed. This caused Xia Keke to go completely blank.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was just sold like that!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fatty took out a card from his pocket with a face full of contempt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is 1.2 million on that card, that is enough money for half a year!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, boss is truly generous,” Ye Zichen put on a money-loving look and picked up the card, but Xia Keke slammed down on her hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you doing?” Xia Keke grabbed onto Ye Zichen’s arm with a nervous expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Girl, it’s two hundred thousand, be happy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, beauty. Say, what use is it to be with a man like this? You might as well be with me, I can ensure you that you will be rich at least.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the fatty tried to persuade her, Xia Keke’s entire face turned dark.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rubbed his hands and picked up the card.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This money is mine, right!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fatty nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then…” Though Ye Zichen had picked up the card, he directly threw it onto the table again. “You’re bringing my girlfriend away, so you have to let me have a woman, right? How about this, I’ll pay for your daughter, fifty thousand per month, here is the money for 2 years!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brat, you were f*cking messing with me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fatty stared with his tiny eyes. Ye Zichen shrugged and smiled without denying it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You just noticed?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you believe that I won’t find someone to kill you?” The fatty’s tiny eyes shone with a murderous light. Ye Zichen shrank his neck and pretended to be terrified. “Ya, I’m so scared!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen slapped the fatty’s mouth, causing him to spin around, then Ye Zichen kicked his stomach.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fatty hit the coffee shop’s wall, letting out a loud sound.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This sound startled everyone in the coffee shop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Ye.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A figure suddenly walked out from the crowd of customers, Ye Zichen looked over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was Bai Dahai, Director Bai from the stone gambling place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fatty that had hit the wall also shouted out when he saw Bai Dahai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bai-ge, save me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Zhao.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Dahai was momentarily confused, then looked over the fatty and Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What, you want to be a busybody?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Dahai did want to calm the two of them down, but when he saw the coldness in Ye Zichen’s eyes, he directly swallowed his words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t dare.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was Young Master Su’s friend. He wasn’t someone he could mess with.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you don’t dare, then scuttle off to the side.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pushed Bai Dahai to the side and walked towards the fatty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Ye Zichen approached him, the fatty’s calls to Bai Dahai became more and more anxious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Dahai shook his head and said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Zhao, Young Master Ye is Young Master Su’s friend. Although I don’t know how you managed to offend him, but older brother can’t help you.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Young Master Su!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The fatty’s looks &nbsp;instantly turned like a round eggplant. They all knew who Young Master Su was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, the fatty prostrated on the ground to ask for forgiveness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Ye, just let me go once.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen mercilessly slapped the fatty’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now you know about calling me Young Master in order to get let off? Just now when you were fighting over laozi’s woman, why didn’t you call me Young Master Ye? Oh yeah, weren’t you going to find your underling to kill me? Where’s your fierceness now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen squinted his eyes, while wearing a devilish smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fatty’s eyes jumped, while he gulped and begged to be let off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The siren of a police car was heard from outside. Ye Zichen looked out the window and saw two police cars parked outside the coffee shop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed like someone in the coffee shop had called the police.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at the fatty that was heavily beaten up by him, then slapped his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The police are here, you’re safe. But, do you know what to say later?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-s.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fatty couldn’t really speak properly due to Ye Zichen’s beating. However, hearing that, Ye Zichen sat down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How is it, my wife, are you satisfied with what I did?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Ye Zichen made a move, Xia Keke was completely shocked. She brought him here to help her stop the fatty, but she didn’t think it would turn out like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she didn’t seem to dislike it at all, and even found that he was now a bit handsome!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Police!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the police also rushed in from the outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they saw the fatty, whose face was swollen, one of the female officers roared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who hit him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen whistled and looked at the ceiling, while the fatty’s little eyes flashed with a hint of struggle, before he clenched his teeth and said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Officer, I tripped.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even a three year old could tell that it was a lie. The officers glanced around the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, the blood on the corner of Ye Zichen’s trousers immediately caught the officers’ eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Capture him and take him away!”</span></p>
