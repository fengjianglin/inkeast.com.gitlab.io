 <p>The Monkey King said what everything was thinking.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Going undercover in the Lightning Emperor’s Estate was dangerous to begin with. Now, so soon after Yang Jian had followed Ye Zichen to slaughter the Bai Family, seeking refuge with the Xiao Family would be even more dangerous.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>No matter how he looked at it, this just wasn’t the right time.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Invincible Adorable Beauty: Ye Zichen, we can’t rush something like this. Xiao Ting is a shrewd old fox, and he’s suspicious by nature.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Monkey King: I agree.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ultimate Charmer: What are you talking about? Why are you bringing up Xiao Ting? &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Invincible Adorable Beauty: It’s a long story, so I can’t explain it concisely, but it’s a crazy idea.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ultimate Charmer: Oh.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pu Jingwan and the Great Sage knew the plan and we worried, but Yang Jian, the man who’d be putting himself at risk, chose to maintain his silence.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Zichen read through the messages and pressed his lips into a grin.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Only Idealism: Of course I’m not so stupid as to send Yang Jian directly to their doorstop. Everything has to proceed step by step. I understand that.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Monkey King: Then what are you suggesting we do?</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Only Idealism: We have to let them watch as the “conflict” between you two intensifies. You heading back now will only accelerate things. At the same time, you can also help ensure the Upheaval Alliance’s safety.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Only Idealism: Next, I have to thank the Bai Family, especially the guy who cut off my left arm.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Invincible Adorable Beauty: You want to… No way! You’re not planning to use that to make the Xiao Family trust Yang Jian, are you? &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Only Idealism: I have to seize anything I can use to my advantage. What, is there something wrong with that?</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ultimate Charmer: I feel dizzy just reading this.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Invincible Adorable Beauty: I’ll explain it all to you later.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Erlang Shen: Then should the monkey and I act immediately?</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Only Idealism: First, send Xue Beibei my way. There’s some things I want to ask her about.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Monkey King: We don’t know her, so why not go looking for her directly?&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As soon as he sent the message, the Monkey King remembered that Ye Zichen was confined to his room. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been reduced to only communicating with them through his phone in the first place.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Erlang Shen: We’ll give it a shot.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The messages in the group ended there. Pu Jingwan and Xiao Yumei were staying in the same room, so they discussed the contents of the last few messages. Yang Jian and the Great Sage, meanwhile, got up and started wandering outside in hopes of bumping into Xue Beibei “by chance.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>They weren’t familiar with the people of the Xue Family, so that was the only way they could carry out their mission to find Xue Beibei.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Everyone else in the chat group was busy. Only Ye Zichen remained alone in his room, sitting by the window and gazing at the flower gardens outside.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I’m like a poor little bird in a cage.” Peering through the windows, he could vaguely discern a few pixies flying between the flowers.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Zichen sighed, then settled down to enjoy the serenity, only for his right eye to suddenly swell up.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He felt his head buzz and his heart pounding in his chest.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;The sudden pain in his chest made him wince. He frowned instinctively, but it seemed this initial pain was nothing but a preliminary greeting.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In just a few breaths of time, all the blood drained from his face, and his phone slipped from his hands and onto the floor.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>His vision gradually blurred, and he struggled to breathe. It was as if someone were strangling him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This sudden change put Ye Zichen into a bit of a panic. He tried to reach out with his divine sense and call for help, but the seals around the room prevented that. His only hope was his phone…</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But even though his phone was so close, he couldn’t quite reach it.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In the end, his vision blurred. He thudded to the ground and sank into unconsciousness.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, half a day passed.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The others in the chat group put this time to good use. Pu Jingwan would occasionally send a few playful messages, but to her disappointment, Ye Zichen ignored her. She couldn’t help but complain about how boring he was.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The others, meanwhile, were out searching for Xue Beibei. Pu Jingwan was the only one sitting beneath a tree and scanning the area with her divine sense.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ding! &nbsp;</p>
 <p>A message notification suddenly popped up on screen. Pu Jingwan opened it, and saw a few new messages in the chat.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Erlang Shen: Hey, are you looking for me?</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Erlang Shen: Your communication system is so strange, but it looks like fun!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yang Jian started sending messages in the chat, but his manner of speaking was rather different than usual.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Monkey King: ???</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Invincible Adorable Beauty: Is that Xue Beibei?</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ultimate Charmer: You found her!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Erlang Shen: Mm, it’s me!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Which of these people is Ye Zichen?” Xue Beibei cocked her head to look at Yang Jian, who was currently standing beside her.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In order to increase their odds of bumping into Xue Beibei, he and the Great Sage had split up. Then, after Xiao Yumei and Pu Jingwan finished their conversation, they further divided the territory up, splitting it evenly between the four of them. In the end, however, Yang Jian was the first to find her.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yang Jian took a few glances at the chat, then said, “None of them!” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Didn’t you say he was looking for me? Hurry up and have him come out. I’m busy,” said Xue Beibei, playing the tsundere. She scrunched up her little nose.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In response, Yang Jian took back his phone and started @ing at Ye Zichen.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Hey, he ought to come quick.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“It’s that simple? It seems your communication method is really convenient! You don’t even need to use your divine sense. All you have to do is hit a few characters out.” Xue Beibei’s eyes brimmed over with curiosity. “How do the messages go out? I didn’t use my divine sense or divine power, so how are the messages delivered?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This….” Yang Jian froze. He didn’t quite know how to explain.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“But then, from the looks of you, you don’t seem smart enough to answer such a high-level question.” To Yang Jian’s surprise, the moment he showed signs of hesitation, Xue Beibei started to taunt him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He clenched his fists and glared, but she’d already turned and ran off, still holding his phone. He called out, but she ignored him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Yang Jian, you have to control your anger. She’s just a kid. Don’t hold it against her.” Yang Jian couldn’t help but remind himself.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Some time later, Xue Beibei came back.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Hey, didn’t you say Ye Zichen would come out? So why hasn’t he said anything yet? Were you lying to me? You… You aren’t just some kind of sex fiend who likes to prey on little girls, are you? Let me tell you clearly: this is the Xue Family! You’d best behave yourself.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>That’s what kids were like nowadays….</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yang Jian was speechless. He rolled his eyes, then snatched his phone back and flicked through the messages. Xue Beibei had used his phone to send Ye Zichen a few messages telling him to hurry up, why the others sent @’ed him repeatedly, all to no avail.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Erlang Shen: Why hasn’t Ye-zi responded yet? He hasn’t checked his messages all afternoon!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Monkey King: Yang Jian? &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Erlang Shen: It’s me!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Invincible Adorable Beauty: It’s been so long without a response. Did something happen to him?</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As soon as she sent the message, Xiao Yumei sent another, but hers was more urgent.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ultimate Charmer: One of you, go find Aunt Ye. Zichen collapsed in his room!</p>
