 <p><span style>Chapter 400 – Mo Di </span></p>
 <p><span style>The sudden appearance of the man catch Ye Zichen’s appearance. </span><i><span style>Judging from his appearance…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>A demon.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Human?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The purple-haired man tiled his head and walked over. When he got closer, Ye Zichen noticed that the man was wearing a gray top and black pants, while he had a stud earring on his ear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The buttons on the front of his shirt were unbuttoned, displaying a lotus-like tattoo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, what caught Ye Zichen’s attention was that the tattoo seemed to be the way the man was absorbing demonic energy, because all of the surrounding demonic energy seemed to go into it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Demon?” Ye Zichen squinted his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The demon scratched his head, then shrugged with a smile, “It seems like you are the strongest out of you guys. Those fellows just now had no way to play with me. How about you play with me for a while?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, this person is one of the two stronger ones that I detected,” Lil’ White jumped onto Ye Zichen’s shoulder and said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows upwards.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Doesn’t that mean that this seventeen or eighteen years old looking kid actually has the strength of a Sky Immortal?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, I’m talking to you. Are you going to play with me or not? I’ll let you choose… Either you all die here, or you play a bit with me. How are you going to choose?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s no helping it. I have no other choice in this situation!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen placed Lil’ White onto the ground, then walked out of the water barrier with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh? You finished choosing? I thought I needed to give you a bit more time to consider,” the purple-haired young man smiled, then crooked his fingers in front of him. “Come over here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Which family of the demon race are you from?” Ye Zichen took several steps forward until he was ten meters in front of the young man. “You should let me know your name. After I kill you later, I might send you a few wreaths.”</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>“Oh?” the purple-haired young man smiled. “Kill me? Interesting. You can call me Mo Di<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>. Mo as in demons, and Di as in Emperor!”</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay, then when you die, I will burn you some money, Mo Di.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ground suddenly cracked, while a golden energy was continuously released from Ye Zichen’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That mode… looked a bit like he was going Super Saiyan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke, who stood within the water barrier, was completely shocked. The familiar aura was the aura of the dragon race. </span><i><span style>Why does he know how to use it?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan’s eyes also continuously twitched. Everything that happened in front of her could no longer be explained using science.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha… You don’t seem too shabby!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Di’s purple eyes shimmered with lights of excitement. At that moment, he was completely defenseless, and merely watched intently to see just how strong Ye Zichen could get.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Ye Zichen’s pupils suddenly contracted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He could naturally tell that this Mo Di did not defend at all. Although a surprise attack was not the most chivalrous thing to do, he had no other choice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He smashed his fist right on the area of Mo Di’s chest that the blood lotus was on. All of a sudden, Mo Di opened his eyes wide, then shot backwards explosively after coughing up a mouthful of acid before he hit the wall of the street.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The smithereens of the wall instantly buried him. Ye Zichen did not stop there, he kicked off the ground…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Seriously… C’mon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Ye Zichen was about to reach the pile of debris, Mo Di, who was buried underneath them, suddenly popped out, while he tilted his head and smiled excitedly. “I thought you would be really strong, but you’re just so weak?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Not good!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s pupils contracted. Just as he was about to dodge, ten huge boulders already surrounded him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang. Bang. Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The boulders more than fifty kilograms smashed towards him, causing him to be completely buried in an instant…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, wake up! Do you think that I’m playing house with you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Di walked over and grabbed the hair of Ye Zichen, who was underneath all the boulders, and dragged him out before casually flinging him to the side.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ugh.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen coughed up a mouthful of golden blood, then licked his lips, before he wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t get too full of yourself, I was merely kidding with you just now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Flop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A pair of humongous black wings spread out behind Ye Zichen. Raging wind was created as they flapped, blowing up all the boulders on the ground, before reducing them to mere debris underneath the pressure of the airflow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Interesting, too interesting,” Mo Di clapped excitedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s irises also began to turn purple… “Interesting? Then I’ll show you something even more interesting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoosh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An afterimage flashed by. After spreading out his wings, it could be said that Ye Zichen’s speed increased by nearly a hundred times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang, bang, bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen continuously punched and kicked Mo Di, causing him to actually gain the upper hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You only have speed, but you lack power.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Mo Di, who was enduring Ye Zichen’s attacks, suddenly reached out his hand to grab Ye Zichen by his collar and pressed him down onto the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I remember. You… are the Fallen they were talking about, right? No, I should actually say, son of a saint and a demon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke and co. ran out of the water barrier. Mo Di merely raised his hand up and pushed towards them, causing them to be instantly bound to the spot and unable to move.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I nearly forgot. I came here in order to find you! I heard that the child of a saint and a demon is very strong, and all of those old fellows in the demon race are running over like fools. Mhmm, that’s right, I used the phrase right. They are running over like fools. But, you’re nothing surprising!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Di kicked Ye Zichen to nearly a hundred meters away, then slowly flew into the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won’t kill you. Those old demons said that you will become very strong in the future, so you definitely will become very strong. I will give you the time to grow. I hope that you can let me enjoy the joy of battle in the future. Bye bye!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment the chains binding Xia Keke, Su Yan and Lil’ White shattered, all of them immediately ran out towards Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Golden blood flowed uncontrollably from Ye Zichen’s mouth. He stood up from the ground under Xia Keke’s support, and stared at the spot Mo Di left from.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Six Realms Patroller, Mo Di…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Creak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clenched his fist with all his might, then, two more people appeared in the space.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dad, where is this shitty place. I want to play games…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Wei?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Wei Chen saw Ye Zichen, he immediately hurried over, “Are the injuries severe?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, it’s alright!” Ye Zichen smiled, then coughed up another mouthful of golden blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zezeze, so pitiful. You actually got beaten up to this degree,” Wei Teng twitched his mouth with a hint of disdain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wei Chen immediately hit his head, “Nobody thinks you’re dumb if you don’t speak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You hit me again,” Wei Teng pouted, then went to the side to doodle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows, “How did you guys get in here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hai,” Wei Chen shook his head. “This isn’t the place to speak, let’s go back and talk…”</span></p>
