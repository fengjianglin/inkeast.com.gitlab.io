 <p><span style>Chapter 276 – Soul Hooking</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This little brother truly understands how to act. </span></i><span style>Ox-Head commented silently.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just look at his words. Not only did he give me merits, he made me feel really good about it…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Little bro, ask!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, Ye Zichen instantly told Ox-Head Sun Yige’s situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ox-Head saw this message, he replied as if it was no big deal, “It is very simple to deal with dual souls. Just find a soul reaper to hook the extra soul away. Do you need Brother Ox-Head to send one over?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s just that simple?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had thought that it would be an extremely complicated issue, he never expected it to be no big deal at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I’ll be troubling Big Brother Ox-Head!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha, it’s just a simple matter,” Ox-Head smiled faintly.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Soul Reapers only charged 100 merits per private job. Ox-Head had already gotten five thousand merits from Ye Zichen, so he definitely got a lot of profit.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ox-Head looked around his social media app for a bit, because ever since he fell, there weren’t too many soul reapers that still kept his contact information.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He messaged several people, only to find that a friend request verification was needed, causing him to curse in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fine, you dare to delete me, Old Ox! When Old Ox stands up once again, I’ll keep you guys in mind!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He took another glance at the names of the soul reapers that deleted him, then clicked on a rather low-leveled soul reaper…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He did remember that soul reaper a little. That soul reaper was one that followed Xie Bian! Back then, the soul reaper was merely a level 3 Ghost Servant, and now, it had already been several tens of years.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He sent a message in a testing manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You there?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The message sent through successfully, and more importantly, the soul reaper replied instantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Marshal Ox, why did you suddenly think of me?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Not bad.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The soul reaper’s impression in Ox-Head’s mind instantly improved, thus, he told the soul reaper what Ye Zichen asked of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, the soul reaper went into the group to find Ye Zichen’s display pic to add him as a friend…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hmm?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why is it him!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s phone vibrated as he stared at the ceiling on his sofa. He took a look at the notification…</span></p>
 <p><span style>White Impermanence sent it to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When did you enter the Underworld’s staff chat?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>How did she notice?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen licked his lips, then quickly replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How did you notice me? Don’t spread the news!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won’t,” White Impermanence replied. “Marshal Ox told me to help you hook a person’s soul. You’re so amazing, you actually know Marshal Ox as well!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Naturally!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen replied in a slightly arrogant manner, while he couldn’t help but retort in his mind.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>If I knew that I only had to look for White Impermanence, I wouldn’t have troubled Ox-Head, and would have just directly went myself.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I’ll come and find you now?” White Impermanence asked in a testing manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothing will happen if you come out during the day? If that’s the case, then come, it’s pretty urgent over here, so the earlier we take care of it, the better!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>White Impermanence immediately appeared in front of Ye Zichen after she sent the message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What monster actually dares to cause trouble in this dog’s territory!” Lil’ White, who was lying down and taking a rest, stood up from the floor and scanned the room with green-lit eyes as his fur stood up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>White Impermanence appeared way too suddenly, so Ye Zichen was shocked by her as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he couldn’t help but make a retort at Lil’ White’s act, “Go and sleep in the corner. I’m home, so there’s no need for you to speak up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh!” Hearing that, Lil’ White hung his head, found a good spot, then fell asleep again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your dog is really amazing, just now, I even felt a hint of spiritual pressure from him,” White Impermanence pointed at the fast-asleep Lil’ White. “if it can grow older, then it will definitely be an amazing divine beast.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Him…?” Ye Zichen twitched his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>“Don’t look down on the small fellow,” White Impermanence replied softly. “I heard that the being beside Ksitigarbha was merely a dog back in the days, but after Ksitigarbha ascended, it became the divine beast Diting<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>.”</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s if I can become an immortal…” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes in annoyance. “Did we go off topic? You came here to help me hook a soul!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh yeah, then quickly bring me over to the person!” White Impermanence nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, Ye Zichen took out his phone and dialed Sun Yige’s number.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the cold drinks store near Polytechnic U.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sun Yige wore a set of black skintight clothes. It was as if she loved the outfit after getting possessed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had even put on a faint bit of makeup on her foundationless face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, the heart of Ye Zichen, who sat opposite her, raced.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, this is your first time asking me out, right? And it’s this sort of place!” Sun Yige took a glance at the rather interesting room and blushed. “Does this count as our first date?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your affability level with Sun Yige increased by 50. Current intimacy level: 60.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen did not have the mind to care about the increased affability level, since his mind was filled with a single thought…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Get the guy who possessed her hooked away and turn Sun Yige back to her past self.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After all, the Sun Yige of the past would have never said something like what she said earlier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You truly changed a lot recently,” Ye Zichen smiled faintly and took a glance at Sun Yige. “All of a sudden, I find it kind of hard to accept!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just slowly get used to it. One day, you will be able to!” Sun Yige smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked up, and gave a cue to White Impermanence, who was standing behind Sun Yige…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Do it!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, the moment White Impermanence made a move, Sun Yige, who sat on the chair, stood up and walked beside Ye Zichen…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is our first date, do you actually just want to keep chatting about this boring stuff to me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sun Yige swiped her finger across Ye Zichen’s cheek, then directly sat down in Ye Zichen’s lap and grabbed his collar with her right hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can feel that you’re very nervous!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ba-thump. Ba-thump.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s heart beat intensely. </span><i><span style>This possessed girl is too bold! I wonder what Class Rep Sun, who is feeling this as well, feels.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It is rather exciting though…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t actually know, right? I have always liked you alot!” Sun Yige squinted his eyes, hugged Ye Zichen’s shoulder, then kissed him without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, White Impermanence also raised her equipment and got ready to act.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, no-one was able to notice Sun Yige’s playful smile as White Impermanence got ready to hook her soul.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a good minute, Sun Yige finally got off Ye Zichen as she wiped her lips as she saw that Ye Zichen was about to suffocate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I really enjoyed this date!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Sun Yige waved her hand and left the store.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sat in the chair in shock while looking at the figure of Sun Yige, who continued to remain like a queen as she left, causing him to immediately raise his eyebrows at White Impermanence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on? Why didn’t she change back? Did you not hook her soul?”</span></p>

 <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Only Idealism:&nbsp;</strong>Big Brother Ox, how do you treat a person that has been possessed?</p>
 <p></p>
 <p><strong>Ox-Head:&nbsp;</strong>Possessed? That's simple.</p>
 <p><strong>Only Idealism:&nbsp;</strong>Please explain.</p>
 <p><strong>Ox-Head:&nbsp;</strong>Just get a soul reaper to hook out the extra soul.</p>
 <p><strong>Only Idealism:&nbsp;</strong>... That's... really simple.</p>
 <p><strong>Ox-Head:&nbsp;</strong>Why do you ask?</p>
 <p><strong>Only Idealism:&nbsp;</strong>A mortal friend of mine seems to have been possessed...</p>
 <p><strong>Ox-Head:&nbsp;</strong>Ahh, I see. Don't worry about it, I'll get a soul reaper to help you.</p>
 <p><strong>Only Idealism:&nbsp;</strong>Wait on a second, a soul reaper? Like... A shinigami? How the heck is a Shinigami supposed to help!? Don't they all have some weird sword weapon thingy called a Zanpakuto and weird Shinigami uniform? Oh yeah, they're mostly pretty much insane and have all sorts of strange personalities, right? If I remember correct, one of them got orange hair, is super tall and is just a Japanese high school student. How is someone like that supposed to help hook a soul out!?</p>
