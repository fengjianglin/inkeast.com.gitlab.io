 <p>Although the Red Demon had already been famous back in the days of the former Demon Emperor, a long time had passed since then. His current position wasn’t particularly high. Of course, the little loli was much the same; no one had even seen her before.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Kui Lin was different. He was the current emperor of the demon race.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>His words were clearly far weightier than the girl or the old man’s.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Everyone in the secret room really did sit cross-legged on the ground. It was true that they’d been in here for quite some time, yet they hadn’t found any means of opening the hidden door.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Zichen’s epiphany was exactly what the little loli had just proposed.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He nodded at his friends and the griend emperors. Then, their entire group sat on the floor.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In an instant, the entire room was terrifyingly silent.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Only when they sat down did they realize that the floor was cool, and moreover, that it carried a special effect that helped them focus.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Didn’t the boss say that we shouldn’t show ourselves lightly?” The stalwart man transmitted to the girl.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Then, what you’re saying is, we should have just gone on waiting?” The girl was sitting sweetly on the ground, but the words she transmitted didn’t match her appearance. “You took on the form of an overdeveloped musclehead, but I guess that really does suit your personality, huh? You’re simple-minded as heck! Think about it! How much time do we have left? If we relied on these morons to figure out how to get inside on their own, the era might be destroyed by the time they managed it.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Alright, alright, that makes sense.” The man didn’t argue with her.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“But it seems that bearer of the emperor star noticed too.” The girl glanced furtively at Ye Zichen. “It seems he’s not stupid. We might be able to relax a little if we work with him.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Drip. Drip….</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Once the room was completely silent, those present could clearly hear the sound of dripping water, just as they had back in the corridor.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Earlier, Ye Zichen had actually searched for the water’s source back in the corridor, yet he couldn’t for the life of him figure out where the dripping came from. This secret room was the same, but this time, he was keenly aware…</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The drips were actually used to keep track of time.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It seemed that Ye Zichen and the loli were right; silence was the only path into the inner palace.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“How long do we have to sit here?” The Great Sage had always been restless and impatient. Back when he sought scriptures, he had a hard time holding still and chanting sutras even when Tathagata himself stood before him.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not even an hour had passed, but he was already struggling to keep still. He twisted about in agitation.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You settle down and behave yourself,” transmitted Pu Jingwan. “Unless you want to experience everyone else present attacking you on all sides, that is. If so, stand up and do as you please.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>There were at least forty people in this room, and all of them were at least imperial-level experts.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Great Sage was known as the Victorious Fighting Buddha, and he loved a good fight, but he wasn’t brainless. He was no match for so many top experts.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Since he couldn’t outfight them, he could only endure. However, if things really went on like this, he really would collapse.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Zichen, meanwhile, contained his energy and immersed himself in meditation. He was now completely focused inward. The floor of this hidden room was really divine; a clear current flowed through the floor and into his limbs and skeleton.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The clean current combed through his unstable divine power, leaving it perfectly in order.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You…..”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A low murmur suddenly broke the silence. This didn’t just interrupt Ye Zichen’s deep meditation; everyone’s eyes popped open.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Who spoke just now?” Quite a few people were visibly infuriated. Entering such deep meditation was rare. Furthermore, after sensing the benefits meditating here brought them, they treasured this opportunity even more than typical deep meditation.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Besides, it hadn’t been easy to maintain their silence all this time. Yet now, someone had gone and ruined it.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In an instant, divine power surged throughout the room. Everyone looked at each other, their eyes filled with undisguised fury.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Zichen frowned lightly too. Just now, he’d been fully immersed; it was truly a rare chance. Less than an hour had passed, but he could clearly sense that his power had been combined through, that some excess nonsense had been trimmed from his grand dao, making his comprehension more refined and exquisite.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>If he’d had another hour, he might have made comprehensive progress towards his mastery over the entire Grand Dao of the Five Elements.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“What a commotion.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As the crowd roared, that same low murmur reverberated through their ears once more. This time, those present realized that the voice didn’t originate from anyone in the room.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Might you be Senior God Emperor?” Kui Lin had sharp eyes, so he cupped his fist in greeting.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“A demon?” The low voice suddenly stopped, but its emotions were indiscernible.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Demon Emperor Kui Lin froze. This was indeed the Transcendent Mausoleum, but the man buried here was the emperor of the god race. It seemed his relationship with demons wasn’t as harmonious as Kui Lin had imagined.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The mausoleum itself might accept all races, but that didn’t necessarily hold true for the god emperor.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Senior!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You’re a fragment of the God Emperor’s soul, aren’t you?” Just as Kui Lin seemed visibly troubled, Red Demon, yet another demon, strode forth unexpectedly. Furthermore, his words weren’t particularly respectful. “If you're his soul fragment, then you’re this mausoleum’s guide. We’ve been waiting here for far too long, and we don’t have time to waste. How about you hurry up and open the hidden door to the palace interior? If we get our good fortune quickly, we’ll leave and stop disturbing your tranquility.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When the others present heard Red Demon’s words, they were stunned despite themselves. He really was one of the six most crazed, proud demons of his era.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When the others encountered a fragment of the former emperor’s soul, they didn’t go so far as to kneel, but they at least greeted him modestly. Kui Lin was a living example of this. Yet Red Demon gave the soul fragment no face at all, and his words were rather unbefitting of a guest.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“What dense murderous energy.” That low murmur rang out once more. “You’re a demon too, and you’ve killed quite a few people.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“That I have. Furthermore, most of the blood on my hands is human,” said Red Demon, his gaze utterly arrogant.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I rather dislike your tone.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“So what if you dislike it? I’m already inside the mausoleum. What, are you going to ‘cleanse’ me? Besides, this mausoleum wasn’t yours to begin with, it’s just that the Four Great Auxiliary Stars selfishly chose to bury you here. What, you don’t really think yourself this place’s master, do you?” Red Demon’s words were just as barbed as before.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Jeezz, that old man’s intense.” Yang Jian’s eyes practically popped out of his head. Who would dare even imagine someone talking to the former God Emperor like that!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Even if it was just a remnant of his soul!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Just as the group was worried Red Demon would provoke the soul fragment’s fury, the voice chuckled. “Your murderous aura is too dense. This isn’t good for you either. But given how frantic you seem, you must have your convictions. Might you explain?” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I want to obtain good fortune, then avenge the former Demon Emperor!” The Red Demon completely disregarded the others present and said this aloud without hesitation.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When he brought up the former Demon Emperor, Kui Lin’s expression froze.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Other demons didn’t know the former Demon Emperor’s situation, but he…</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He was well ware!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The moment the Red Demon said that, Kui Lin knew what he had to do.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He couldn’t leave Red Demon alive!</p>
