 <p><span style>Chapter 10 – The Peach of Immortality shows its effects </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Ye, just now, you went to…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Hai’s expression was filled with anticipation. Ye Zichen handed the peach over with a shrug.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There aren’t anymore of the Great Recovery Pill, please take this peach.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone in the room pretty much drew a blank as to why he came back with just a peach. Huang Ming even swore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brat, what do you mean by this?! We came to ask for a Great Recovery Pill, and now you’re trying to fool us with a crappy peach?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Crappy peach?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s expression immediately turned ugly. Huang Ming had been causing trouble from the start. Even a person with very good temper would get angry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How’s it your business when I’m speaking to your older brother brother?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Say that again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Ming angrily stood up from the sofa. Nobody had dared to speak to him like that while he was in Bingcheng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huang Ming!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Hai also became upset, they had come here to ask for someone else to do things for them. Was this the attitude they were supposed to have?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, he started regretting it, he really shouldn’t have brought Huang Ming over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hai-ge, I think I’ll take my leave first. If you don’t want that peach, then just throw it away.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen turned around and left. Seeing that, Su Yiyun also followed behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That brat, Huang Ming, was far too cocky, so he didn’t much like him either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Hai, I’ll leave as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Commissioner Liu smiled coldly and left with Officer Zhang in tow, in an instant only Xiao Hai and Huang Ming were left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cousin, that brat didn’t view you properly at all. He’s purely messing with us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shut up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Hai was mad.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The situation wouldn’t be like this if it wasn’t for Huang Ming!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Hai hesitated for a few moments after looking at the peach on the tea table, then decided to bring it back anyway.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi, what exactly are you doing? Why do I feel like I don’t really get you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun asked with curiosity written all over his face on the way back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m just merely a poor student!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pfft, you really are shameless. I’ll believe it if you had said you’re a poor student before, you actually dare to say you’re poor now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun twitched his mouth. Ye Zichen already had a card with five million inside. If he was still calling himself poor, then what about other people?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t say anything back at the dorm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Commissioner Liu’s situation was too shocking. If the people at the dorm found out, then they would definitely spread it with their big mouths.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry, I will definitely stay silent. What’s more, you also know that I don’t live at the dorm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Back at the school, Ye Zichen felt the way the students at school looked at him was a bit weird.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The finger pointing of everyone around him caused him to feel rather uneasy, so he could only walk even quicker to get back to the dorm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Su Yan, look, isn’t that the guy that smashed people with underworld money!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two girls stood at a distance not far away from Ye Zichen and looked him over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm, it really is.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan, the school beauty of Polytechnic University.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was at a height which caused people to look up to her for she was thrice blessed, family background, her academic achievement and her appearance. She was the dream girl for countless men at Polytechnic University.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When the news came out on the school forums, I had thought that he was a rich second-generation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What, you like rich second-generations?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan smiled playfully, while the girl beside her pouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pfft, I don’t like those rich second-generations.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then that’s it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But I feel like this person is mean, just how unlucky it was for the person who was smacked with underworld money!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really? I feel like that guy’s rather interesting,” Su Yan smiled towards Ye Zichen’s back, then pulled on the girl beside her. “Keke, let’s go back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Interesting? Why don’t I feel that?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Keke also looked towards Ye Zichen one last time before leaving with Su Yan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ol’ Five, you are a celebrity in school now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhang Rui played with his phone as he laid on his bed. Ye Zichen also understood why the students looked at him so oddly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The underworld money situation had been found out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His candy coating of being a fake rich second-generation was discovered, so he naturally caught the attention of others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but to twitch his mouth at the comments underneath the new thread.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A rich second-generation was found to be pretending to be poor was definitely something that people loved, but since it was the opposite was what people felt disgusted with.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen naturally did not care about all of this. He was the one who knew best about his current strength, and the most important thing right now was to satisfy the Monkey King.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great Sage!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry and send it over to Old Sun!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Great Sage Sun replied instantaneously once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen actually felt a little proud when faced with this kind of reply speed, it seemed like his position with Great Sage Sun was rather high.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, little deity will send it over to Great Sage now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen scanned a bottle of Wahaha Calcium Milk, causing a huge red packet to instantly appear on the screen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why is there only one?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Monkey King replied with three angry emojis behind the message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great Sage, this sort of treasure can only be gotten by chance. This little deity only had one left, originally I had wanted to keep it for myself to enjoy…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop pretending with Old Sun. Do you believe that Old Sun would not call out you in the group?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He is threatening me!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The corner of Ye Zichen’s mouth raised in a smirk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then go ahead say it, Great Sage. What this little deity said is all truth. If Great Sage doesn’t believe it, then that can’t be helped. However, if you point this little deity out, then there will not only be Great Sage that is asking this little deity for private red packets!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Never mind, I, Old Sun, will let you go this time!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you, Great Sage!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your intimacy level with the Monkey King increased by 10, 60 more is needed to reached Trusted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled as he looked at the intimacy level on the screen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He understood the logic of rare goods will bring about a large profit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had only just gotten in contact with the Monkey King’s interest in Wahaha. That’s why he wanted to limit it, to make the Wahaha really rare. Only then, would it pique the Monkey King’s interest and cause the Monkey King not to feel like he was taking a loss.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After lurking in the group for so long, he noticed that there was just a few people that actively chatted in the group every day, and they usually chatted about topics that Ye Zichen didn’t understand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that the people in the group had stopped handing out red packets, Ye Zichen threw his phone towards the side of his pillow and laid on the bed, while thinking about that peach.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I wonder what that peach actually tastes like!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, back at the Xiao family home.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Hai had brought Ye Zichen’s peach back, but he couldn’t get his grandpa to eat it immediately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ignoring the fact that his grandpa was so ill that he couldn’t even open his mouth, he could only use liquids to maintain his metabolism; he needed a medical team to check the peach over first to see what effects it really did have.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the door to the mansion opened, Xiao Hai ushered the medical team in. Yet, when he arrived in the living room, he found that the peach was already gone...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Hai, you came back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A young mistress walked down from the second floor. Xiao Hai didn’t dare to speak when he saw her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he was judging only through the voice, it should be his mother, Cui Xuefang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Hai, what are you spacing out for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mom!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Hai opened and shut his mouth like a carp, causing Cui Xuefang to reach out her hand to touch his forehead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Silly child, why are you acting like this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mom, do you know what changes have happened to you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What changes happened to me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cui Xuefang rolled her eyes at Xiao Hai, but when ahe glanced over at the living room’s mirror and saw her own face, she was instantly stupefied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, she quickly walked over to the mirror.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mom, did you eat the peach that was on the tea table?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pa.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Hai slapped his thigh and screamed into his phone, which he had taken out from his pocket.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huang Ming, immediately go and apologize to Ye Zichen. If he doesn’t forgive you, then just wait to till he does!”</span></p>
