 <p><span style>Chapter 320 – Ye Zichen’s First Advertisement Failure</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao Ziming’s veins popped up as he grabbed Ye Zichen’s collar tightly and stared at the latter with bloodshot eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandson, let go!” the fatty raised his hand to smack Zhao Ziming’s hand away. However, Zhao Ziming pushed the fatty with his left hand, knocking the fatty aside as he cursed. “F*ck off! If you come over here one more time, laozi will kill you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao Ziming’s hint of madness in his eyes caused Ye Zichen to frown.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Although Zhao Ziming wasn’t any good person before, at the very least, he had a bit of tolerance. He would never make his emotions so painfully obvious. Just how did he become like this…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Tell me, what did you come to the capital for!?” Zhao Ziming roared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen licked his lips and sighed, “I merely came to handle some business in the capital. You seemed to have thought too much into it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Handle some business?” Zhao Ziming curled his lips, then laughed mockingly with a sinister gaze. “You are just a f*cking poor student from Bingcheng. Handle some business in the capital? Do you think that laozi is a goddamn retard? Be honest, did you come to the capital to fight over Lin Xiyue with me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s something wrong with you!” Ye Zichen frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, there is something wrong with me,” Zhao Ziming laughed and opened his mouth wider and wider. “Laozi is sick. I’m sick!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen frowned and smacked Zhao Ziming’s hand away forcefully, “Don’t come and go crazy with me even if you are sick. No wonder Lin Xiyue said that she doesn’t want to be with you. Who would dare to be with you when they see your retarded look?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You two already met?” Zhao Ziming glared. “Since you two already met, you’re still telling me that you didn’t come to fight over her? Ye Zichen, I’m telling you, Lin Xiyue is someone belonging to me when she’s alive, and she’s my ghost when she’s dead! Even if she’s dead, she has to die in front of my eyes. Don’t even think about getting between us. Otherwise, I’ll cause you and your family to die…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…” Ye Zichen grabbed Zhao Ziming by the collar forcefully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the police in the station ran out the door alongside Lin Xiyue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>None of them knew how to handle the situation when they saw it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Xiyue also ran over with a frown, “What are you guys doing!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Yue, you’re here,” a bright smile instantly covered Zhao Ziming’s face. “I just met savior, and spoke a bit to him, but the moment he heard that we were getting engaged, he immediately got angry…”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This shift of blame…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Xiyue bit her lips and looked over. Ye Zichen pushed Zhao Ziming backwards, “I wish you both happiness.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, he immediately turned around to leave, while Fatty Yin also followed suit after giving Zhao Ziming the middle finger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhao Ziming stared closely at Ye Zichen’s fleeting back, while a sinister look filled his eyes. After a long time, he turned around with a bright smile, then held Lin Xiyue’s hand, “Lil’ Yue, why didn’t you tell me that savior came?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn’t know that he came to the capital,” Lin Xiyue retracted her hands from his with a replused look. “I still have a case to follow, so I’ll talk to you later.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Zhao Ziming watched Lin Xiyue leave, his gaze became more and more sinister.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He punched towards the sportscar door, causing a huge dent to appear, then drove away with a gloomy look on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, what was wrong with the grandson just now?” Fatty Yin frowned unhappily in a hotel room. </span><i><span style>That brat actually dared to push me. F*ck, he’s too cocky.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Officer Lin’s boyfriend,” a hint of worry appeared on Ye Zichen’s face when he mentioned Zhao Ziming.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Right now, Zhao Ziming really is a bit crazy. Could he have gotten some sort of mental scar? Why did he turn like this?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck, that grandson…” Fatty Yin snorted angrily. “He actually dared to push Lord Fatty! Bro, how about I find a chance to kill him off. That way, you and Officer Lin can also… And Lord Fatty can be relieved of anger.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please don’t…” Ye Zichen quickly stopped him. </span><i><span style>This fatty truly isn’t scared of things getting out of control. He actually wants to kill the guy off.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Zhao Ziming clearly isn’t a normal person. If he is killed, then there might be some sort of trouble later on. What’s more, you can’t just decide to kill off a normal person either, since it is a human life after all…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“This is no good, that’s no good, then did Lord Fatty get bullied for nothing!?” the Fatty opened his eyes wide and downed the glass of wine. “Oh yeah, bro! Why did that brat call you Ye Zichen just now? Isn’t your surname Gu…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Ye Zichen wanted to explain…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nameless!” a soft call sounded out in Ye Zichen’s mind. He subconsciously blanked out for a moment, then immediately realized that the person who spoke should be Chang’e.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m here, what is it?” Ye Zichen replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothing, I miss you,” Chang’e smiled softly. “You didn’t contact me at all these past few days, so I was worried that you are busy. That’s why I didn’t dare to disturb you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have been a bit busy recently.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know you’re busy,” Chang’e smiled. “Oh yeah, those things on my face all calmed down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Were the treasures I gave you pretty good?” Ye Zichen chuckled. </span><i><span style>If the modern day products are good for the deities in the Heavenly Court, then I can find a chance to advertise it there.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s alright, but I didn’t use it,” Chang’e replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen sent the products over to her, she truly thought that it was some sort of treasure. However, right after using it, she felt like it was truly a lot worse than the pills that maintains beauty and youthfulness from the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a huge difference in both the ingredients used and its effects.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, what she could not deny was that the product did have a tiny bit of effect on removing pimples, but that effect was almost negligible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why didn’t you use it?” Ye Zichen was confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, Chang’e told her all about the products’ issues. Ye Zichen’s first reaction after hearing the issues was…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>How’s that possible!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>All of the products I chose to sell in the Heavenly Court, in terms of both food, phones and diamonds…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>They are all able to gain the favor of the deities in the Heavenly Court. Why doesn’t cosmetics work?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Ye Zichen immediately understood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ingredients and components!</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter what, the Heavenly Court was a place where deities resided. Any simple plant there would be a treasure in the mortal realm. Meanwhile, no matter how good something from the mortal realm was, it was still a mortal product.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason that the food and phones could sell so well was because the phones had plenty of functions, while other ones in the Heavenly Court found the food rather new and refreshing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for diamonds, those were selling well only because women like shiny things.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, products like cosmetics were way too low of a quality for the deities in the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It seems like I have to be more careful when I gift treasures to the deities in the Heavenly Court in the future.</span></i><span style>Ye Zichen said quietly to himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the next thing that Chang’e said in Ye Zichen’s mind completely shocked him!</span></p>
