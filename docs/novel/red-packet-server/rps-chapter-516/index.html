 <p><span style>Chapter 516 – Ability of the Bomb</span></p>
 <p><span style>The elder was rather confused as he held the lighter in his left hand and black bomb in his right.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It truly is a high level spiritual treasure, it actually needs to be used as a set.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, the elder did not completely believe Ye Zichen’s words. He looked towards him and couldn’t help but frown. “Youngster, are you sure that you aren’t lying to this old man?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior, just what are you saying? I merely gave you the spiritual treasure to ensure our safety. If I am lying, then why am I still standing here? Wouldn’t it be much better for me to just run?” Ye Zichen spoke with utter sincerity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The elder checked him out, then snorted, “Heh, you better not lie to this old man. You know what would happen if you do.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, he pressed down on the lighter, causing a small flame to light up…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The elder raised his eyebrows when he saw the fire. </span><i><span style>This really is a treasure. </span></i><span style>He couldn’t help but to believe Ye Zichen’s words even more, and was greatly looking forward to the power of the black metal ball.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I need to light it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Light it. This spiritual treasure is pretty powerful. The Spiritual Breeze Villagers aren’t too strong, so can you allow us to retreat five meters?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What kind of tricks do you want to play?” The elder squinted his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>God, this elder sure is wary.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior, don’t think too much. This youngster has already said it, the spiritual treasure is very powerful, we are merely retreating by five meters,” Ye Zichen smiled coyly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The elder stared at him for a moment, “Fine, if you want to take the chance to run, then… Heh…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t dare!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen retreated a few steps with a forced smile, while the Spiritual Breeze Villagers also did the same.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The elder’s expression also turned more serious. He lifted the lighter towards the bomb’s fuse…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zzz…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is strange.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Even though I lit it, I still don’t feel any fluctuation of spiritual energy.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The elder stared straight at the bomb and the fuse, which was quickly burning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen also put up a barrier of spiritual energy in front of him and the villagers.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Crap.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment, the elder felt a chill down his spine.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He raised his hand to throw the bomb out, but it was already too late.</span></p>
 <p><span style>BOOM!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The bomb exploded in the elder’s hand with a huge noise. Everything in a ten meter radius was in the radius of the explosion. Zhou Zhenhe, and the Zhou family members were all confused by the explosion alongside Meng Da.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Some weaker people couldn’t even react or scream before they died.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Youngster, you tricked this old man!” A sinister voice cried out from the flames.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Fire Cloud Gate elder slowly walked out. His right arm was already destroyed by the explosion, and his entire body was covered in wounds…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You really know how to kid. I did give you the treasure used to mine black crystal ores. I can even swear by my heart demon that it is the truth. However, there was something I did trick you about. This isn’t a spiritual treasure.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled calmly as he stood in front of the elder. However, he was still a bit shocked.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I didn’t expect the bomb to be so powerful. The elder had already put up defenses as quick as he could, but the explosion still affected him so much.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Youngster, I’m going to kill you!” the elder endured the his body’s sufferings and stepped forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Ye Zichen’s expression darkened, while spiritual energy swirled around his body…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let this junior send you off. You already lived for so long. I… am still young!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smirked, revealing his glistening white teeth and his dark gaze, then transferred all of his spiritual energy into his right arm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xuan-Yuan Sword also appeared in his hand by his call, while the sword itself shimmered with golden light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Slash!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A powerful slash flew towards the elder. Then, all of a sudden, a huge hand appeared out of nowhere and shattered the conjured wind blade.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Youngster, how dare you!? You actually dared to attack a guest chamberlain of our Fire Cloud Gate. You are seeking death!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A huge bang sounded out in the sky, and another hand reached down from the sky towards Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, laozi’s in charge on laozi’s turf. Just what the heck are you!” Ye Zichen raised Xuan-Yuan Sword and instantly shattered the huge hand. Then, he sliced the sword horizontally towards the elder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This… is the spiritual treasure I want,” the elder looked at Xuan-Yuan Sword in Ye Zichen’s hand in a mesmerized manner. Then his eyes suddenly bulged as he roared angrily. “Youngster, you tricked this old man! I won’t let you off after I become a ghost.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You really can’t do anything if you end up in the Underworld. Go, there isn’t anything for you here anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slash.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blood scattered across the courtyard. The Fire Cloud Gate guest chamberlain also stared at Ye Zichen, then fell to the ground unwillingly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Youngster!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop yammering up there. Come down if you can!” Ye Zichen kicked the corpse of the elder to the side, then looked up into the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Youngster, we, the Fire Cloud Gate, will remember this grudge!” The purple clouds in the sky dispersed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes in disdain, and wiped away the blood on Xuan-Yuan Sword, then stowed it away into his arm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked towards the surrounding people and saw that Meng Da and the Zhou clansfolk had all died in the explosion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please deal with them,” Ye Zichen said plainly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Mo, who was watching the situation unfold at the entrance, ran over with glistening eyes, “Ye Zichen, what did you give that old man just now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A bomb,” Ye Zichen replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bomb?” Zuo Mo raised her eyebrows. “Can you mass produce that treasure?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As one of the Treasure Tower’s leaders, she had already managed to see just how amazing the bomb was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though it was a single-use item, it had to be truly very powerful to hurt a mid-stage Human Immortal so.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It I could get a stockpile for the clan, or get the elites of the clan to carry a few each…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Then even Spiritual Body leveled people wouldn’t be afraid of Human Immortal level experts!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Mass production is possible. Do you want to stock up on it?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows. “However, I need to supply enough for our Spiritual Breeze Village first before I can supply you with them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen also realized just how useful a bomb would be from the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though the storage of bombs was dangerous, nothing would happen as long as they were a bit more careful. If even that doesn’t work, then he could just buy a few spatial artifacts for them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The most important thing is just how strong the bombs are. </span><i><span style>I can’t stay in the village forever. If anyone else causes trouble here, then I’ll threw him a bomb to show how friendly I am… More importantly, the person just now should be a high-ranking person in the Fire Cloud Gate.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Since we have a grudge now, I do have to leave the villagers a way to protect themselves.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem, if you lack materials or manpower, you can come to me any time,” Zuo Mo nodded without any hesitation…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ll see!” Ye Zichen smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he took out his phone and sent a message to Yue Lao. “Mass produce bombs. Produce as many as you can!”</span></p>
