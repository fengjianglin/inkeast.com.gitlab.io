 <p><span style>Chapter 201 – The Kind Killer – Mu Jinglei</span></p>
 <p><span style>Di Tian, who stayed under the same roof as the Hou brothers, gradually became more obedient.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had no other choice, if he didn’t, he really would get beaten up!</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, under Ye Zichen’s education, those two brothers were terribly evil in beating him. That’s why, right after eating breakfast super early in the morning, Di Tian obediently ran over to the kitchen sink to wash the dishes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Ye Zichen was watching TV as he sat casually on the sofa. </span><i><span style>To be honest, I seem to be going to school less and less now…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Ye Zichen was pondering whether or not he should report in at school…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Buzz!</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen heard the phone in his pocket ring, he placed it beside his ear and heard the sound of Zhang Rui gulping.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi, hurry and come back to school. The Kind Killer’s looking for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen promptly rushed towards the school after putting his phone in his pocket without saying anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the university’s office of academic affairs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhang Rui smiled dryly as he looked at the woman with a delicate face, who looked to be twenty seven or twenty eight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If people were to judge her solely based on her appearance, she would definitely be a goddess in the hearts of men.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, at that moment, the faint cold smile on her face caused the entire office to freeze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was Mu Jinglei, the head of the veterinary department, whose nickname was the Kind Killer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zhang Rui, how many times did you help Ye Zichen call out his presence in class?” Her soft voice and the warm smile on her lips would cause people to mistakenly think that she was just a neighboring older sister.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Zhang Rui, as a student in the veterinary course, knew, this older sister was not as mesmerizing as her appearance led one to think.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gulp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhang Rui silently gulped, then dipped his head.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I can’t meet her eyes.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I’m dead if I do.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow! You aren’t speaking. You guys have a very deep friendship, as expected of brothers that have slept together for two years! Just now, you called Ye Zichen when you were outside, right? You said… KIND! KILLER! Right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She retained her warm smile, but the atmosphere had become even more suppressing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhang Rui was extremely stressed out. Being in the same room as the Kind Killer was definitely not a lucky thing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A knock sounded out at the office door. Not long later, Ye Zichen stuck his head in to have a look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s eyes opened wide when he saw Mu Jinglei, who sat at the desk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You still remember coming back to class? I was getting ready to expel you,” Mu Jinglei smiled. Her kind smile was like a sharp sword, but she wasn’t the kind to stab you to death at once, she was the kind to slowly cut you to death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen ran in quickly, and subconsciously looked at the file on the desk.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>She’s serious.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>She really wanted to expel me.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shrugged with a coy smile, then licked his lips, “Miss Mu, why did you come back so early? Didn’t you say that you were going to be gone for a foreign exchange for two months!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha… Two months, wouldn’t you completely rebel in the school?” Mu Jinglei smiled meaningfully. Then she looked at Zhang Rui, who didn’t even dare to breathe on the side. “Go on, I’ll deal with you later.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhang Rui ran away from the office in less than a single second.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t want to stay in this sort of damn place for even a single second.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Zhang Rui left from the office, Ye Zichen pulled out a chair and sat opposite Mu Jinglei with a chuckle, “Sis, how did the foreign exchange go?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who allowed you to sit down? Stand up!” Mu Jinglei glared at him. “I’m the dean of your department in school!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There aren’t any outsiders here, so why act so formal? I saw auntie a while earlier.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is my mom well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Jinglei actually lived in Ye Zichen’s village before. She was the child of his auntie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason he could come to Polytechnic University to study and choose study a veterinary degree was partially due to Mu Jinglei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She’s doing pretty good. Our home’s getting taken down. Auntie and little bro should have moved elsewhere. What? Have you guys not been in contact recently?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Jinglei’s expression saddened. Ever since she started to work, she very rarely contacted her home. This was especially true since she wasn’t on the best terms with her family.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It could be said that they had no communication outside of her giving living expenses to her family.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, they gradually ended up like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sis is busy, so it’s normal, just go back to take a look a while later when we’re on holiday.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the sort of conversation that Ye Zichen liked. Mu Jinglei nodded, then all of a sudden, she frowned and slammed the table, “Wait, why are we chatting about this? Tell me, why haven’t you been going to class? I also heard that you’ve been rather close with Su Yiyun, that rich second generation… Zichen, we’re from normal families. You are always messing around with him now. When you graduate, he can go and work in his dad’s company, but you can’t!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but feel a bit of warmth in his heart when he heard everything from the initial interrogation to the advice later.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>She wasn’t his real sister, but she was just like one…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Sis, I understand, I will definitely go to class properly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Jinglei sighed softly when she saw Ye Zichen’s apologetic expression, then stood up and walked to his side, “Alright, sis wasn’t blaming you. I just wanted to tell you not to disturb your future. We haven’t met for so long, sis will take you out for a nice meal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The place the two went was the restaurant that Ye Zichen frequents under Xiao Hai’s control. Mu Jinglei couldn’t help but shake her head when she saw the fancy decorations within the restaurant, “Zichen, sis can’t afford to treat you to this place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although she was the dean of a department in a university, her salary wasn’t that high. She might be able to afford a normal western restaurant, but this place…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It was clearly a place that only wealthy people could go to.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Even if you want to rip sis off, it has to be somewhere that sis can afford financially, right?” Mu Jinglei said as she started to drag Ye Zichen out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, the shop manager hurried over and smiled respectfully, “Mr. Ye.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see that the first floor is full? Is there space on the second?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is space on the second floor, but there are still rooms in the third!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need, I just wanted to eat a casual meal with my sister…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood,” the manager bowed respectfully, then made a “please” gesture before leading Ye Zichen and Mu Jinglei to a booth near the window on the second floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mr. Ye, what dishes should be chosen?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just do as you see fit, but don’t be like last time. It was too much, we couldn’t finish it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood, please wait a moment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The manager’s respectful attitude caused Mu Jinglei to be stunned. When the manager left, she finally whispered secretly, “Zichen, what’s going on?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s a long story. Your little brother got a bit money. Just treat this meal as little brother’s treat to welcome sis back,” Ye Zichen laughed softly. However, Mu Jinglei looked at him with a shocked expression…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A bit of money… This place isn’t somewhere that you can come to with something as simple as a bit of money, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey…” Ye Zichen smiled idiotically, but the phone in his pocket started to vibrate with a very bad timing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen took out his phone to take a look at WeChat, then saw a huge red packet from Erlang Shen.</span></p>

 <p></p>
 <p><strong>Liu Qing:&nbsp;</strong>BWAHAHAHAHA! Chang'e only wanted spicy gluten and not you! BWAHAHAHA!</p>
 <p><b>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</b>Shut up! At least I got a False Marriage String, that should mean something, right?</p>
 <p><b>Liu Qing:&nbsp;</b>Bwahahaha! It's probably false because she thinks that you're the god of spicy gluten or something, she just wants free spicy gluten!</p>
 <p><b>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</b>Ugh. Whatever, at least we're a step closer to your revival.</p>
 <p><strong>Liu Qing:</strong> I suppose. Hmm... Why does it feel like we're forgetting someone or something...? I can't help but feel like we haven't seen what's going on with that person that I'm forgetting...</p>
 <p><i>Meanwhile, at Ye Zichen's apartment with Third Fatty Jing.</i></p>
 <p><strong>Di Tian:&nbsp;</strong>Damn you Ye Zichen, you better watch out, if those stupid buff guys weren't there... Ouch, f*ck this, why the heck am I cleaning the toilet!? And damn those buff guys, they hit me way too hard!!!</p>
