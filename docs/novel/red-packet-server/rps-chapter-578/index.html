 <p><span style>Chapter 578 – Swirling Flash Plate</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone either showed a solemn expression, or one of self-blame. Yet, some actually blamed everything on Ye Zichen and his group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s all on you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why is it on us? There is only one first place, everyone else who’s not first has to go in. I didn’t even say anything when I’m the one in the last place, and having the hardest trial, so what’s wrong with you?” Ye Zichen smiled, then turned around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu Chengtian’s face turned stark white from fear. He grabbed hold of Bian Tianrui’s shoulder with a shudder. </span><i><span style>I got the second to last place…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m done, I want to go home!” Mu Chengtian sat down onto the floor and whined like a child.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bian Tianrui looked up him, then chose to disregard him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s one thing him being sick, how did he end up retarded?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Let me tell you in secret, actually I only just made this decision. If you want to blame anyone, then blame that ignorant young man. It’s all because he was so cocky,” the playful laughter sounded out once more, causing many people to look towards Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you looking at? If you glance over even one more time, then I’ll dig your eyes out of your sockets,” Third Fatty Jin squinted his eyes and said angrily. Yet, when the group of people looked towards him…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahem. I can’t do it, but Boss Ye can.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ignore them,” Ye Zichen grabbed Third Fatty Jin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, an arched door appeared near the strength-testing machinery.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go in, don’t make me force you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your results were all in the upper middle half, so I’m sure you guys will be fine. Don’t be nervous, just act normal.” Ye Zichen repeatedly comforted the others before entering.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, they all shook their heads. Zuo Mo bit her lips, “We’re worried about you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why worry about me?” Ye Zichen chuckled, then patted their shoulders. “Believe me, it isn’t so easy for me to die.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come back alive!” Zuo Mo and co. called out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come back alive,” Ye Zichen nodded with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen ended up in a dark cave through the teleportation gate. The water in the floor went up to his ankles, and for some reason, the sound of dripping water seemed unusually ear-piercing in the silent environment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He would occasionally hear terrible shrieks and the creaking of insects and rats.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is my last pair of shoes I have from the Modern Realm…</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he finally found a dry place, he immediately took off his shoes, and poured out the dark water alongside a disgusting stench.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you have time to think about your shoes, then might as well think about what we should do,” Xuan-Yuan Xiang floated in midair, then frowned at the surroundings. “It is extremely humid here, and there is a lot of cold air. What’s more, even though you’re a Human Immortal expert, those cold air and wetness will still seek into your bones. We can’t stay here for long.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s that dangerous?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had used his celestial spiritual energy to disperse the surrounding cold aura, he did not expect it to be able to seep into his body at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“More importantly, I feel an aura that makes me tremble here,” Xuan-Yuan Xiang looked around repeatedly. </span><i><span style>She has waged war alongside the Yellow Emperor and slayed countless monstrosities, just how strong is the thing is that can make her tremble?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“The hellish test the geezer set me definitely wouldn’t be simple, but since this is a game, then there’s definitely a way to pass it,” Ye Zichen stretched lazily, then put on the shoes he dried off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had no choice, that was his only pair of shoes. If he went barefoot, then got knows what kind of poisonous insects would bite him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn’t expect the armor the system got me to be useful so quickly,” Ye Zichen clicked open the Treasure Chest on his phone with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was the image of a silver armor on the first block on the third roll within the Treasure Chest. Ye Zichen clicked on it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Name: Swirling Flash Plate</span></p>
 <p><span style>Craftsman: Duan Gu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Notes: The Swirling Flash Plate was the final work of the primordial refiner, Duan Gu. They say that parts of his soul entered the armor while crafting this armor.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Duan Gu.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is that the name of the Niflheim Dragon?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Withdraw.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You are about to automatically withdraw the Swirling Flash Plate. It will be directly equipped on you. When you want to remove it, all you have to do is silently think that. It is the same for when you want to put it on once more. Would you like to proceed?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The silver armor directly appeared on Ye Zichen. It offered all rounded defense that protected Ye Zichen all the way from his feet to his teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although an armor like that should feel very heavy, it felt rather light to Ye Zichen. It was as if he wasn’t even wearing an armor. What’s more, there was a spiritual formation that was able to absorbed cleansed spiritual energy on the interior of the armor, allowing the spiritual energy which enters the user’s body to become purer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Child, did you come to Mount Supreme?” At that moment, an ancient, but gentle call sounded out in Ye Zichen’s mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are…” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The name is Duan Gu. I am the master of Mount Supreme,” the elder replied with a powerful tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s body trembled when he heard the reply.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Master.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Then the person outside…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Sir, are you the real Niflheim Dragon?” Ye Zichen licked his lips and his heart raced.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Child, why are you asking?” the elder was a bit confused. “Could it be… Oh of course, since you have awakened me and gained the Swirling Flash Plate, it means that Mount Supreme has appeared. Are you the Chosen One I spoke of back then?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not!” Ye Zichen shook his head. “I entered with a key, but am not your Chosen One. But I do have some questions for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You actually aren’t? Ahh, forget it, this is fate. What do you want to ask about?” the elder’s tone sounded rather helpless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seems like he wanted to give this final work to the Chosen One, but such is fate. Since Ye Zichen had already gotten the armor, it could only be said that the Chosen One was not fortunate enough.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What was the purpose of your leaving Mount Supreme behind?” Ye Zichen asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course it’s to give some opportunities to the youngsters in the future,” the elder replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But why did you set different stages in Mount Supreme and use games to eliminate the participants?” Ye Zichen frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know how strong the people enter are. On a more selfish note, I’m not a unreasonably kind person. I did have my own selfish reasons for leaving Mount Supreme behind…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Selfish reason? Is that to use those of us who seeks opportunities as entertainment?” Ye Zichen laughed coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Entertainment?” the elder was confused. “Child, what are you saying? The games are to eliminate the ones that do not fit the criteria. How can it be entertainment?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Elimination means death. You are truly an almighty god!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What death? Those who fail the missions will be automatically expelled from Mount Supreme. How could they die? I, Duan Gu, has never killed a person without reason in all my several hundred thousand years,” the elder replied with a bit of rage, but then he asked. “Child, tell me, did you have to go through something!?”</span></p>

 <p><b>Stranger 1:&nbsp;</b>This is all your fault!</p>
 <p><strong>Stranger 2:&nbsp;</strong>That's right! If it wasn't for you, then we wouldn't even have to go through this trial!</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Shut it! You think we want to go through it? Also, you guys at least have somewhat decent scores. I'm in the f*cking last place! You know what that means? I have the damn hardest trial to go through!</p>
 <p><strong>Stranger 3:&nbsp;</strong>That doesn't change the fact that it was because of you guys that we have to go through the trials now.</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Do you really believe that? Even if it is, there are this many of us as well, so we screwed over ourselves as well! Do you think that's what we want!?</p>
 <p><strong>Stranger 4:&nbsp;</strong>Damn you!</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>Go damn yourself! Nobody could have expected this!</p>
