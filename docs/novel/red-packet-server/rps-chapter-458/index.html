 <p><span style>Chapter 458 – The System Makes a Move</span></p>
 <p><span style>The heart of Ye Zichen, who was reading the screen, jumped. </span><i><span style>Great Sage actually wants to wreak havoc in the Heavenly Court. </span></i><span style>Then he combined that with the other messages in the group. </span><i><span style>Command, Jade Emperor…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Was Yang Jian and Nezha captured by the Jade Emperor?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Who can tell me the specifics?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Ye Zichen appeared, all of the other members in the group immediately began to yammer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Sky Sovereign, where did you go for so long?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: Ge, why didn’t you appear recently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: Have you dealt with the situation in the Modern Realm?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang: …</span></p>
 <p><span style>The group instantly filled up with messages, but no one talked about their earlier topic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen squinted his eyes and couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just what happened at the Heavenly Court? What happened to Yang Jian and Nezha?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: About this…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mother of Lightning: Sky Sovereign, just don’t mind it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: It’s not something we can stick a hand in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Lord Taishang: Agreed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Fortune: Mhmm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry up and tell me, did Yang Jian and Nezha get captured by the Jade Emperor?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen knitted his eyebrows closely together. Not long after that, Sun Wukong immediately replied in the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: Yeah. The geezer Jade Emperor arrested them. I, Old Sun, am about to lead my army and wreak havoc in the Heavenly Court, you coming?</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: @Monkey King. Great Sage, don’t do that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: Yeah, let’s chat peacefully. The verdict isn’t out yet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: I like to watch flame wars, not actual fights.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So they really did get captured by the Jade Emperor, and the reason is obvious. It was because of them leading their armies out to slay demons.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Seriously, this Jade Emperor. Slaying demons is a good thing, he’s actually arresting them to punish them.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>This was all because of me. I definitely cannot just allow the Jade Emperor to take away their command over the army.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“@Monkey King, don’t act too recklessly. Wait for my news.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen left the chat group and shouted in the room, “You can hear me speak, right? System, you can hear me, right!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: Mhmm, what is it kid? You aren’t used to the Three Realms, so you need me to tell you a bedtime story so that you can fall asleep?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The system notification popped up almost immediately, causing Xuan-Yuan Xiang to be completely shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Ye Zichen replied, “Stop making fun of me. I didn’t get back at you for the Modern Realm yet.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>If the system had notified me of what would happen in the Modern Realm, then the situation might not have turned out that badly.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Xiao Yumei wouldn’t have…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Yang Jian and Nezha wouldn’t have been arrested by the Jade Emperor to be denounced. This was all linked, and the origin is this system.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: The Modern Realm was destined for this trouble. That was not something my words could have changed. What’s more, I can’t exactly go against the Heavens, right? This was all meant to be.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, then you were really put on the spot.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: You can interpret it like that.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>If it isn’t because I’m weak, and can’t figure out where the guy sending the system notifications is, I would definitely grab him and punch him.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen let out a long sigh, then raised his eyebrows, “Never mind. I don’t want to waste my breath with you. Yang Jian and Nezha were arrested by the Jade Emperor, who wants to strip them of their commands over the military. You should have a way to stop it, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: Smart! But why should I help you?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won’t get angry with you about the Modern Realm!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: So what if you get angry with me about it? That isn’t enough to make me help you.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Creak.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This guy…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clenched his teeth tightly, then snorted as he looked at the message the system sent, “Then what do you want?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: I’m haven’t thought of it yet. How about this, just treat it as you owe me a favor. Then, just return the favor to me when I need you to.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The, the system sent another notification of “wait for my news” before ending the conversation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen put his phone aside, then laid on the bed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xuan-Yuan Xiang blinked and asked, “You were chatting with the phone just now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm!” Ye Zichen nodded. “But this isn’t a normal phone. It should be under someone’s control.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And he can persuade the Jade Emperor?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Probably!” Ye Zichen wasn’t completely confident, but since the system had replied with so much certainty, Ye Zichen felt like the person should be capable of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the Cloudy Palace of the Golden Arches.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Jade Emperor sat on top of his throne in a robe decorated with images on dragons. He knitted his eyebrows darkly as he looked at Yang Jian and Nezha, who were below him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only the three of them were within the palace. They had already been there for a week, and none of them had even taken a step out of the palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yang Jian, Nezha… This sovereign has already heard everything you guys have to say, but those still cannot be reasons for you guys to descend with your troops in private.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Slaying demons and defending justice is my duty. What was wrong with that?” Yang Jian argued.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the Jade Emperor shook his head with a smile, “No need to say anymore. Hand over your command seals!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jade Emperor,” Just as the Jade Emperor was about to collect their command seals, he suddenly heard a chuckle in his mind. “I feel like you can let them go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are you!?” The Jade Emperor answered in his sea of consciousness, while he spread out his spiritual consciousness to find the person who was transmitting sound into his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop searching. You won’t be able to find me. I’m someone above you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Jade Emperor trembled. After a while, he finally replied after suppressing the shock in his heart, “Sire, I wonder…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A friend asked me to come and plead for Erlang Shen and Nezha. Both of them are very loyal people. I feel like leaving them with their command over the military is pretty nice. If you strip of them that, then you might regret that in the future.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Jade Emperor’s expression drastically changed the moment the voice in his sea of consciousness answered.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He shouldn’t be saying that without any basis. If I think deeper into his words, doesn’t that mean he’s telling me that there will be a revolution in this realm in the future?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Also, Yang Jian and Nezha are actually on my side, but if I strip them of their command over the armies…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, the Jade Emperor did not dare to think any further.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sire, can you speak clearly?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The fates should not be shared,” the voice of a man in the Jade Emperor’s mind answered once more. “I’ll leave it at that. Everything will be up to you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sire, then would it be possible for you to tell me who your friend…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Only Idealism!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The voice no said no more after that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Jade Emperor knitted his eyebrows tightly, and pondered about the final words of the master in his sea of consciousness.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Only Idealism!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What a deep reply? Only following one’s ideals… Is he telling me to follow my heart, or is he telling me that the other person’s name is Only Idealism?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The Jade Emperor shook his head in confusion. When he returned to his senses, he saw that both Yang Jian and Nezha had already handed their command seals over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Never mind, I’ll leave the command seals with you. Remember, do not make anymore mistakes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoosh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Jade Emperor returned the command seals back to Yang Jian and Nezha, before burying himself in the meaning of “Only Idealism”.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Original Chapter Teaser:</strong>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p><strong>God of Thunder:&nbsp;</strong>Shit man. The Jade Emperor seems really pissed.</p>
 <p><strong>Old Lord Taishang:&nbsp;</strong>Yeah, it's been so very long since I've seen him anywhere near this angry.</p>
 <p><strong>Mother of Lightning:&nbsp;</strong>Do you think that Erlang Shen and Nezha will be fine?</p>
 <p><strong>Monkey King:&nbsp;</strong>They better be, or I'll make that geezer Jade Emperor feel the stick once again.</p>
 <p><strong>God of Thunder:&nbsp;</strong>Monkey, that isn't helping.</p>
 <p><strong>Monkey King:&nbsp;</strong>There was nothing wrong with what we did at all. Eradicating demons is the duty of the the troops of the Heavenly Court!</p>
 <p><strong>God of Thunder:&nbsp;</strong>Still. I do think that they'll be punished. They did act without orders after all.</p>
