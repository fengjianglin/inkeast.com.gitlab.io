 <p><span style>Chapter 148 – The Great Sage is my bro</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sudden laughter stunned everyone in the room.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I, Old Sun.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Such a familiar feeling.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who was pressed onto the floor by Di Tian, grunted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You dare to bully I, Old Sun’s, bro. Heh…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Di Tian felt his body lighten, then when he finally reacted he found himself floating up uncontrollably.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zeze, bro, you are in a pretty terrible position in this secret location.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A peach appeared in front of Ye Zichen. Ye Zichen turned his head, then saw…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upper lips that protruded over the lower lips, a forehead that stuck out of a sharp face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person wore a red and gold crown on his head, as well as a golden war amor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Great Sage.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you being stunned for? My, Old Sun’s, peach is not for free. Five bottles of Wahaha.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gulp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It really is Great Sage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not only Ye Zichen, but Su Yan and the other people in the mansion were stunned as well.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Isn’t this the Sun Wukong from Journey to the West?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why did he appear here?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke was also shocked when she saw this. However, she very quickly revealed a smile, that others wouldn’t notice, on her lips, while retracting the golden light in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, eat the peach!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ai,” Ye Zichen answered, then raised his uninjured arm to receive the peach, before wolfing it down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A warm feeling poured through the meridians of his entire body, while the pores on his body opened up as if they received a new life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, the injuries on his body also healed at a speed visible to the naked eye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, it wasn’t wrong to say that his body was completely changed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His wounds healed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first thing Ye Zichen did was run to Su Yan and Xia Keke’s side to untie the ropes on their bodies, “Are you alright?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m fi-fi…” Su Yan stuttered for a long time without managing to finish. Both the Great Sage, who suddenly appeared in the mansion, or the injuries on Ye Zichen’s body… “You…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll explain it to you later,” Ye Zichen rubbed Su Yan’s hair, then looked at Xia Keke, who was on the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She seemed rather calm, but her beautiful eyes were fixated on the Great Sage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An envious feeling suddenly appeared in Ye Zichen for some reason.</span></p>
 <p><span style>F*ck, since the Great Sage arrived, all of his spotlights were stolen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A million questions popped up in Ye Zichen’s mind when he saw the Great Sage walk over in person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great Sage, why did you come?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, isn’t it extremely easy for I, Old Sun, to come here?” Great Sage laughed. “Remember that Life-Saving Monkey Hair? I, Old Sun, would sense it when you are in danger, allowing me to teleport over to you.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Life-Saving Monkey Hair.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked up at Liu Qing, who was in midair, in confusion. </span><i><span style>Wasn’t that monkey hair lost?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“But bro, this secret location of yours is extremely weird. It’s actually suppressing Old Sun’s cultivation levels, but it’s fine, a False Earth Immortal level is just barely enough!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Earth Immortal!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>False Earth Immortal!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the hell are those?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was extremely confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was this the way the Heavenly Court marked their power levels? Di Tian seemed to have mentioned something like Spiritual Body, what was that?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, why are you blanking out? Before we met, I, Old Sun, felt that you weren’t this sort of person that wasn’t good at talking.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah… Haha… Great Sage’s arrival caught this sovereign off guard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen laughed dryly, while retorting in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What was he supposed to say in this sort of situation? He was completely confused!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s to be off guard about this? I, Old Sun, have wanted to meet you for a ages.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Great Sage and Ye Zichen chatted rather happily, but everyone else at the side were completely confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For example, Su Yan. Or Di Tian, who was floating in midair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for Liu Qing…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sun Wukong actually came…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen and the Great Sage chitchatted a bit more, before the latter scanned everyone in the mansion using his Fiery Eyes of Truth, before landing his gaze on Di Tian, who was in midair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, what’s with him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He kidnapped two girls of your bro, I was coming to fight him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, he’s capable,” Great Sage stomped his foot, then reached out towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let go of me. I’m telling you, my older brother is a late stage Spiritual Body master of the Rogue Immortals. What’s more, my father is a Complete Spiritual Body master of the Rogue Immortals, if you don’t want…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Great Stage reached out and slapped Di Tian’s head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Spiritual Body. I, Old Sun, can slap that to death with a single slap. Threatening, I, Old Sun…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, Great Sage revealed his savage nature.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, how do you think it should be handled?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled playfully. </span><i><span style>Who cares how the Great Stage appeared. It seems like the situation has been reversed.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen recalled the pretentious look on the grandson, Di Tian’s, face earlier…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck, you dare to hit laozi. Do you see this? The Great Sage. This is laozi’s bro. You dared to act pretentious with laozi just now… Hmm?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Get more pretentious!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Get more pretentious!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen slapped down on Di Tian’s head every time he cursed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen only stopped when his hands were numb from the slapping, “Great Sage, how would you handle it if it’s up to you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uhm…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Great Sage revealed a troubled expression. During his journey to the west to acquire scriptures, he had become the Victorious Fighting Buddha. What’s more, in the western Buddhist Territory, he had also spent a long time reading Buddhist scriptures and abstaining from meat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although his ruthlessness was still there, it had decreased by a huge margin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His Fiery Eyes of Truth could tell whether Di Tian was a monster or a human…</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he was a monster, then the Great Sage would have just directly slammed his staff down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he was human…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It would be bad if I, Old Sun… killed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen also understood the hesitation of the Great Sage. Thus, he nodded, “Then just transform him into something!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s fine, bro, what do you think he should be turned into?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Turn him…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled, as a great idea surfaced in his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen walked out of Di Tian’s mansion with a Transformer in his hand an hour later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Di Tian’s subordinates were all innocent people. Thus, Ye Zichen did not unleash his rage on them, and merely thought of it as gaining some merits for himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Su Yan and Xia Keke continued to stare at the Great Sage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the Great Sage helped him solve a huge problem, for his women to look at other men…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What? You said that the Great Sage isn’t a man, but a monkey?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Even if he’s a monkey, he’s still a male monkey!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen licked his lips and patted the Great Sage’s shoudlers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Great Sage, you’re too eye-catching in this secret location. Can you change yourself to dress insomething similar to what I’m wearing…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, sure.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>White smoked arose, then the Great Sage turned into the black-shirted hulk Ye Zichen saw in Di Tian’s mansion just like a magic trick.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Stars sparkled in Su Yan’s and Xia Keke’s eyes as they exclaimed outloud.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s expression darkened once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>F*ck, the Great Sage took the spotlight once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it wasn’t for the marriage string remaining intact, and the affability level not decreasing…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He would even suspect the two girls of changing their hearts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, what do you think about this?” The Great Sage raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded with a forced smile, “Not bad.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although he was annoyed, but to be honest…</span></p>
 <p><span style>This Seventy-two Transformations was so amazing, if he could learn it…</span></p>
 <p><span style>That would be beyond amazing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, Ye Zichen couldn’t help but clench his fist. He had to develop the industry in the Heavenly Court properly, so that he can quickly earn enough cultivation experience to buy a volume.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No, why did he have to buy it!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Isn’t the Great Sage here!?</span></i></p>
