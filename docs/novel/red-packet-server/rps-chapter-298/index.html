 <p><span style>Chapter 298 – Auction House</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Qi immediately felt that the atmosphere wasn’t right when Su Yiyun said that, so he immediately slipped away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Xiao Hai raised his eyebrows, “This clubhouse seems to have a rule that if five advance tier members simultaneously request it, it is possible to kick a member of a lower tier out, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is indeed a rule like that!” said the waiter who had blocked Ye Zichen from entering.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good,” Xiao Hai raised his eyebrows. “We just managed to get five advance tier members here. I propose kicking that brat… What’s he called again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Han Qi!” said Su Yiyun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, that brat. I suggest that we request to kick him out of the clubhouse, is that alright?” Xiao Hai smiled at the people around him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem!” Lin Hanben smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since he dared to speak ill of Young Master Ye, then I naturally will not let him stay!” Dongfang Wenyi curled his lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I raise both hands and feet to kick that grandson out!” Su Yiyun raised his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Out of the five advance tier members, only Zu Siliang did not say anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Zu Siliang saw everyone look over at him… “It has already come to this, so do I have any reason to refuse?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Qi, who ran from the place of the incident, let out a sigh of relief as he silently complimented himself for his intelligence.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>If I continued to stay there, who knows what trouble would arise.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“This really is strange, why does that brat know so many big shots?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Han Qi was deep in thoughts, two security guards with white gloves walked in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mr. Han, your membership status has been revoked. Please leave!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bullshit, how could laozi’s membership get revoked!” Han Qi cursed with a glare. “Laozi is Mayor Han’s son, do you dare to revoke laozi’s membership?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m very sorry, the membership you possess is of the intermediate tier. Five advance tier members have declared jointly to cancel your membership status. According to the regulations of this clubhouse, you are no longer a member. Please leave!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The security guards made a please gesture. Han Qi still wanted to muck around, but the two security guards frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We apologize in advance!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two guards each took one arm of Han Qi and directly dragged him out. During the process, Han Qi continued to scream out phrases like “I am the mayor’s son” and “I won’t let you guys off”.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I wonder what Han Zhenguo would feel if he finds out that his second son made him look so terrible,” Xiao Hai wouldn’t help but chuckle as he watched Han Qi get dragged out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s lucky that his eldest son is rather smart. Otherwise, his family would be pretty screwed!” Dongfang Wenyi twitched his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the views of everyone else in the clubhouse, Xiao Hai and co. were clearly important people in the clubhouse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Plenty of people in the clubhouse would occasionally look towards them, but would not dare to walk over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The split of levels in the business circles were clear. If you go over to people of a higher level than you without that sort of status, that was just asking to get shamed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, most of the people were actually more curious about Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was someone that they had never seen in the clubhouse before. However, the high leveled people were all very friendly towards the young man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, they all forced themselves to remember Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was so that they would try to get closer to them if they met in the future, and even if they couldn’t, they still had to ensure to not offend him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uhm, what sort of place is this? Why are you guys all here?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows. None of the people in front of him were ones that people could meet easily. He never expected to see all of them here at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The name of this clubhouse is Treasure Vault. It is an auction house and can be counted as a business circle!” Xiao Hai smiled. “The people that can come here are normally those that have a net worth of more than ten million. Normally, people can come here to gather, but most of the time it is rather quiet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiao Hai is right. Actually, the reason we all came here is because an auction is being held,” Zu Siliang also smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Auction?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This clubhouse occasionally auctions some antiques or special items. You’ll understand after coming in to take a look!” Su Yiyun chuckled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ta ta ta…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sound of high-heels walking on floor sounded out. Not long later, a woman wearing a red qipao arrived and made a please gesture, “The time is right. Ladies and gentlemen, please head upstairs!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment they reached the second floor, Ye Zichen finally believed that it was really an auction house since neither the exterior of the clubhouse nor the first floor made it seem like one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a podium for the auction alongside auction machines for entering your bid…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop spacing out, our place is upstairs!” Su Yiyun clapped his shoulder. Only then did Ye Zichen realize that there were separate rooms upstairs which were probably for the advanced tier members only.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Xiao Hai, Zu Siliang and co. went to their respective rooms, Ye Zichen followed Su Yiyun to his.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Actually, my dad was the one who was supposed to come to this auction, but since he’s busy with business deals, he told me to come,” Su Yiyun shrugged. “To be honest, I’m not very interested in stuff like antiques.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, it’s not anyone else’s fault that you’re free!” Ye Zichen shrugged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How am I free. I invested in a project as well! It’s your medical company. I feel like it will definitely be profitable!” Su Yiyun raised his eyebrows and smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Anyone can tell!” Ye Zichen was speechless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, the auction had officially begun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as Xiao Hai had said, the items being auctioned were mostly famous paintings or antiques, and after using the Fiery Eyes of Truth to check, Ye Zichen confirmed the fact that all the items on auction were real.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, he would be able to know that they were real even without using the Fiery Eyes of Truth to check since there was no way everyone shouting out so much were all idiots!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The next item on auction is a weapon!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The auctioneer in red qipao smiled. At the same time, the staff also took out a sword-shaped item wrapped in a red cloth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they pulled the red cloth away, it revealed that what was wrapped within was not a sword. Rather, it was a sword’s sheath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the stains on it, the sheath seemed to have a long history.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We, the Treasure Vault, have estimated that this item is from the primordial times. We are unable to confirm the exact dates, but it can be certain that it was from before the Han Dynasty!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The entire auction house exclaimed out in surprise.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>If what they said was real, then it really would be an ancient antique.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Even if this sheath was merely a normal sheath, there is a huge collection value after so many years.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Plenty of rich businessmen already begun to call out their price, while Su Yiyun, who sat in the room, twitched his mouth, “What’s the point of bidding for a shitty sheath. Ye-zi, am I right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>No one answered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-zi, what are you thinking about?” Su Yiyun nudged Ye Zichen with his elbow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did Ye Zichen come back to himself and raised his eyebrows, “How much is it at now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Four million!” Su Yiyun said plainly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ten million!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately pressed down on the auction machine without hesitation!</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Original Chapter Teaser:</b>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>God f*cking damn it! Where did that shitty bastard meet all those big shots?</p>
 <p>It was obviously that he's mates with that Su Yiyun jerk, but where did the rest come from? Xiao Hai, Dongfang Wenyi... Like seriously!?</p>
 <p>What's more, there was even Zu Siliang, the supposed fiance of the famous Yang Yushi, and...</p>
 <p>That man! if I didn't make a mistake, that was Lin Hanben! He isn't even of our generation, he's of my dad's generation! Just what the heck? Why would someone like Lin Hanben go and help that little piece of shit who's a nobody!?</p>
 <p>F*cking hell. Just wait. I'm definitely going to get my sweet ass revenge. I'm going to rip that little shit's arms... No, fingers... No, I'll get someone to start with the fingernails! I'll get someone to rip them off him one by one while they watch me f*ck that hot Xiao woman!</p>
 <p>I'll definitely think of a good way to get back to him.</p>
 <p>On another note, I'm a super genius, I immediately sneaked away just now before any trouble actually occurred.</p>
 <p>Wait... Huh? Are those guys... WHAT? What the heck are they saying!? My dad is the f*cking goddamn MAYOR! How dare they!?</p>
