 <p><span style>Chapter 282 – Pretending</span></p>
 <p><span style>A bell-like giggle sounded out from the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei nodded immediately, “Yeah, this is my little lover.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My god, I was actually right,” Cai Xinyu smiled exaggeratedly, then pinched Ye Zichen’s cheek. “You actually managed to make our Yumei fall, you’re one charming kid! How about letting sis feel your charm tonight?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s expression stiffened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe,” Another round of giggles sounded out when Cai Xinyu saw Ye Zichen’s stiff expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, stop bullying my little man. I have proper business to talk about with you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know,” Cai Xinyu threw a flirty glance over at Ye Zichen, as if flirting with him was her hobby. “But I am merely getting my friend to go through some contacts for you, I can’t guarantee whether it’ll work or not.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm,” Xiao Yumei nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, a man walked into the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man wore name brand casual clothes, and had a Vacheron Constantin watch on hisr wrist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is?” Xiao Yumei glanced over at Cai Xinyu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gong Cheng!” The man handed his business card over to Xiao Yumei with a smile that would make others feel rather comfortable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled, then took the name card over, “Haha, a business card with gold power plating. It really is luxurious.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, he put it away like a money lover. As he did, Ye Zichen couldn’t help but mutter, “I might be able to sell it for quite a lot later.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha, if this little friend lacks money, I think I can offer some assistance, “The man smiled faintly and took out a card that he placed on the table. “Three hundred thousand…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Enough!” Xiao Yumei’s expression turned a bit dark.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cai Xinyu also felt that the atmosphere wasn’t right, causing her to quickly lighten the mood, “Yumei, this is the friend I wanted to introduce to you, Gong Cheng! He knows a person by Yang Yushi’s side.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then she turned towards Gong Cheng, “This is Yumei’s boyfriend, his name is…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen!” Ye Zichen smiled faintly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re actually Director Xiao’s boyfriend! Then I’m so sorry, I thought that you were Director Xiao’s secretary or assistant or something,” Gong Cheng’s face was covered in an apologetic smile, but the underlying meaning of his words were clear.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Secretary, assistant!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It was clear that he was mocking Ye Zichen for not having the right to even be her friend.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei’s expression darkened even more, causing Ye Zichen to hold her hand and squeeze softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he smiled towards her and nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since we all know each other, then let’s sit!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment everyone sat down, Gong Cheng poured two glasses of wine and placed on in front of Ye Zichen, “Little Brother Ye, there was much offense just now, sorry about it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Gong Cheng immediately downed the glass of while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, Ye Zichen also nodded and downed his glass as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before Ye Zichen placed down the wine glass properly, Gong Cheng started once again, “It seems like Little Brother Ye is still in University, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, second year,” Ye Zichen replied softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It really is amazing for you to actually be with Boss Xiao during your second year. Back when I was your age, I was starting up a business with a few friends. Although it was rather difficult then, I do have a bit of accomplishment now. For example, this room is something only platinum members can get, and a platinum membership requires five million.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow,” Ye Zichen continued to reply softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gong Cheng felt extremely annoyed. Ye Zichen’s replies made him feel like he was physically hitting cotton, so there was no sense of satisfaction at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little Brother Ye is doing fine too. Date Director Xiao properly, then when you graduate, be a manager in Director Xiao’s…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need, I’m not going to work at her place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little Brother Ye wants to start your own business? It’s not easy for university students to do it now. However, Little Brother Ye should be able to succeed with Director Xiao.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gong Cheng mentioning Xiao Yumei all the time was just to emphasizing how he thought Ye Zichen was treating Xiao Yumei as his sugar momma.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Ye Zichen…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not going to start my own business, it’s fine as long as she supports me,” Ye Zichen shrugged plainly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gong Cheng was speechless, he never expected Ye Zichen to be shameless to this degree.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He actually clearly stated that he was going to leech off Xiao Yumei so blatantly, it’s like he’s not afraid of being laughed at at all.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Also, Xiao Yumei’s expression seems to show that she has already accepted that?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck, it seems like he’s servicing her real good,” Gong Cheng thought darkly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Cai Xinyu did not think that. She understood Xiao Yumei’s personality very well. The young and handsome guy in front of her was definitely not someone simply leeching off her…</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, her gaze towards Ye Zichen become more meaningful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen also noticed Cai Xinyu’s change. </span><i><span style>I didn’t think that this open sis is kind of capable as well.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Little Brother Ye…” Gong Cheng wanted to speak up once again, but Ye Zichen had already gotten sick of bullshitting with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop calling me Little Brother Ye, we’re not really acquainted. We came here for business, everyone’s pretty busy as well, so let’s stop wasting each other’s time, alright?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little… Boss Ye truly speaks straight to the point, hahahaha!” Gong Cheng used his laughter to hide his embarrassment. He could totally just leave in a situation like that, but he didn’t…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wanted to show off his contacts!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wanted to make Xiao Yumei and Cai Xinyu see the difference between him and the sugar baby.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gong Cheng took out his phone, then spoke with the person on the other side of the call.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Doing so, Gong Cheng placed himself in an extremely low status. That was something unavoidable, since he had gotten the phone number from a rather amazing friend of his.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From what he heard from the friend, the owner of the number was a true young master. Even that friend of his had to speak subserviently to this lord that he just spoke to.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And that’s really something, considering how his friend was truly in an amazing spot in Gong Cheng’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gong Cheng naturally had to submit to someone that even his friend was afraid of.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the call, Gong Cheng placed his phone onto the tea table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he saw the strange looks in the room, he couldn’t help but cough, “An amazing person is coming later. Don’t blame me for not reminding you, but you have to be careful when you speak.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen twitched his mouth with a smile. From his perspective, Gong Cheng was nothing at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The amazing person he spoke of was definitely just mediocre in Ye Zichen’s eyes. What’s more, Ye Zichen did not rely on Gong Cheng’s contact. If it doesn’t work out, he’s just directly go to find Zu Siliang or Yang Yushi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>About an hour later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During that hour, Gong Cheng’s shitty mouth endlessly showed off his achievements in his career, while putting down Ye Zichen with his underlying meaning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei was extremely angry, but Ye Zichen ignored him…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>We aren’t the same level of people from the start, so there was no need for me to get angry at someone like him.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Also, the amazing person that Gong Cheng invited is rather arrogant, he’s actually taking more than an hour to come over.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the door to the room was pushed open. Ye Zichen looked up. The moment he saw the person who had arrived…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He smiled. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><strong>Cai Xinyu:&nbsp;</strong>We're going to wait for a friend of mine who has the contact of someone close to Yang Yushi. Meanwhile, why don't you introduce us?</p>
