 <p><span style>Chapter 465 – City</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen yawned sleepily in the carriage. Ever since he had arrived in the Three Realms, he was never once able to sleep properly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This day was no different as Stone and co. woke him up before the sun even rose.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sleep, sleep, sleep. Are you a pig? Why are you always sleepy?” Lil’ Yu glared at him angrily in the carriage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen merely rolled his eyes at her without saying anything.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Do you think I want to be like this? If it wasn’t because that girl Xue Lan troubling me so much last night… Ahem, don’t take that wrong, we didn’t do anything. It was just that girl continuously asking whether I’m that mysterious master.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>How can a person’s nose be so good? Xuan-Yuan Xiang was clearly in her spiritual form, yet the girl was still able to track Xuan-Yuan Xiang’s position using only her scent. </span></i><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but shake his head when he recalled the situation from the previous night.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I even activated the Fiery Eyes of Truth to judge whether the girl was even human, but what I saw was that she was just a normal human, and was at the body tempering level.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, that girl was only able to smell where Xuan-Yuan Xiang was, and not see her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, Ye Zichen naturally used his lying skills, and repeatedly denied the fact that he was the master. Despite that, Ye Zichen could still tell from Xue Lan’s gaze when she left that she didn’t quite believe him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Village chief, we’re here!” shouted the villager driving the carriage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s group immediately dismounted the carriage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ve worked hard. Hurry on back!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay,” the villager drove the carriage away and left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did they look up, and when they saw the glorious city sprawling out in front of them…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zeze, this is rather spectacular.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had seen a lot in the Modern Realm. Although the city itself seemed rather spectacular, in the mind of someone like Ye Zichen, who had watched a lot of historical dramas… </span><i><span style>Is it even possible for it to be more spectacular than the palaces in the Modern Realm!?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Impossible!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Holy, just how many times is this the size of our village?” On the other hand, Stone acted like a bumpkin who had entered a city for the first time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xue Qi immediately patted Stone’s shoulder and indicated him to not talk so loud.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, it was Xue Qi’s first time in the city, so he was astounded by the grand structure in front of him as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How many?” the guard, wearing an armor made out of black iron, at the city gate asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lil’ Yu smiled, “Four!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you have a residence permit?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No!” Lil’ Yu shook her head, then took out two silver coins from a pouch, which she then handed to the guard. “We would like temporary residential permits for seven days!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm!” the guard nodded, when four tokens suddenly appeared in his hands. “The tokens will disappear after seven days, at which time you guys will be automatically teleported out!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood!” Lil’ Yu received the tokens and gave them out to Ye Zichen and the others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>After they finally entered the city, Stone opened his eyes wide, “Staying here needs money as well? Twenty celeste<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> for seven days? That is just too expensive!”</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>“That was just to enter town, it’s even more expensive if we’re going to stay in an inn,” Lil’ Yu smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Xue Qi raised his eyebrows, “The spiritual energy here…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You feel that? The cities are enchanted by formations, causing the spiritual energy here to be absorbed by the people easily. That’s why strong people will normally choose to stay within cities. Of course, if you can buy a property here, then you will be able to stay here permanently. If our villagers could live here, then can you even imagine how much better they will develop?” Lil’ Yu squinted her eyes and smiled. Since she was always out, she knew a lot more than Xue Qi and co., and it was because she knew what the cities were like that she encouraged Xue Qi to move the villagers to the cities…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is truly a good place. It would definitely be amazing if we can get all the villagers to stay here,” Xue Qi was moved as well. In the short period of time that they had entered the city, he felt as if his strength had improved. </span><i><span style>It really would be amazing if our villagers could stay here permanently.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“But… we needed a token each for us to enter. Do our villagers also…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course not. If we purchase a manor here, we can apply to be a faction or a family. The scribe in the city lord’s manor will record that down, allowing us to freely move about in the city. The scribe will also know as soon as possible when a baby is born, and its name will be automatically added onto the record.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So amazing,” Ye Zichen couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows when he heard Lil’ Yu’s words. He had thought that the residential permits in the city would like the modern realm, where the children would have to be recorded down the moment they are born…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I didn’t expect it all to be fully automated. That’s so amazing.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“The abilities of a Sky Immortal are not as simple as you can imagine,” Lil’ Yu giggled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But… this is all based upon us being able to sell the black crystal, right?” Xue Qi intentionally lowered his voice. “We are foreign here, where are we supposed to sell them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“About this…” Lil’ Yu revealed a troubled expression. She was more knowledgeable, but that did not mean that she had a way to sell the black crystals. “I do know of a black market, but the people there… I’m worried that they would attempt to directly take it from us!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck, didn’t I just owe you guys several tens celeste? Is there a need to treat your Lord Fatty like this? Did Lord Fatty spend very little at your place before? You really have no conscience!” At that moment, a fatty in a blue robe put his hands on his hips and cursed loudly in front of a restaurant near Ye Zichen and co.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seven or eight muscular fighters stood in front of him alongside a flamboyantly dressed woman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Our restaurant does not allow our customers to owe us money. Your previous spending are in the past, and you spent that willingly. You actually dare to come and spend at our place even when you have no money. Do you think our girls are easily bullied?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Ye Zichen thought to himself… </span><i><span style>Why did the way she put it make it sound less like a restaurant and more like a brothel?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Look at you, isn’t it only several tens of celeste? I, Lord Fatty, finally realized it. You really think that your Lord Fatty has no money, here…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pa.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fatty took out a small jade bead from his pocket and threw it over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need for change. Treat it as Lord Fatty’s tip, but don’t even think about Lord Fatty visiting your place in the future. Also, Lord Fatty will remember your humiliation of Lord Fatty. In this city… You seriously don’t know Lord Fatty’s strength. Your shitty place, and just wait to be closed down!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With those fierce words, Fatty turned around and left with a cold chuckle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the flamboyantly dressed woman did not take his words seriously at all, she immediately picked up the bed. “Lesser Spiritual Bead, it’s worth a thousand celeste. It seems like laoniang got lucky.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Fatty felt his heart bleed after throwing out the spiritual bead. </span><i><span style>F*ck, I didn’t actually want to throw that spiritual bead. Ugh, it was a huge loss.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Fatty, who was walking with his head down, bumped into someone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you f*cking blind!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person the fatty bumped into was Ye Zichen, who had intentionally walked over to let the fatty bump into him. At the same time, both Lil’ Yu and Xue Qi yanked his arm, and told him that he should be more careful in the city.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen merely raised his eyebrows with a chuckle, “Fatty Yin, it seems like you aren’t doing so well in the Three Realms!”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Original Chapter Teaser:</strong>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p><em>In Ye Zichen's perspective.</em></p>
 <p>Damn it. I really am not used to this rural lifestyle... I used to sleep a shit ton, but would sleep late and wake up late. I really am not used to this habit of waking up early. I seriously don't get how these villagers do it!</p>
 <p>Sigh... We're supposed to be going to the city today aren't we? I wonder what it's going to be like. Is it going to be like some ancient citadel that is heavily protected? Or will it just like one of those ancient cities in historical drama?</p>
 <p>Also, just where the heck are we supposed to sell the black crystal ores? Just because we have so much of it, doesn't mean that we'll be able to sell it off. If everything Lil' Yu and Xiang-jie said about the black crystal ores are true, then it'll definitely be very hard to sell them out without bringing trouble to ourselves...</p>
