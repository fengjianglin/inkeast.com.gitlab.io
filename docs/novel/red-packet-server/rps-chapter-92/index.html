 <p><span style>Chapter 92 – Jing Wan’s team is established</span></p>
 <p><span style>When everyone got to the scene, Ye Zichen and Wu Haoyu had already walked out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The guards for the club all rushed over when they heard the sound, causing plenty of people to think that something was about to happen to Ye Zichen and Wu Haoyu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But nobody had thought that…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The guards respectfully walked over, while a coldness surfaced on Wu Haoyu’s honest face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Send Young Master Bai to the hospital. I’ll pay the medical bill, then send someone to apologize to the Bai family. If they want an explanation, then tell them to come and find me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The guards immediately carried Young Master Bai out of the club. All of the bystanders were shocked, nobody could have imagined that the honest lad that had always been beside Lin Ru was actually the owner of this club.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was also stunned, while Wu Haoyu smiled apologetically, “Sorry, something like this happened on my turf.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hahaha, what’s there to apologize about?” Ye Zichen shrugged with a smile. “We didn’t suffer any losses, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s true.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Su Yan and Lin Ru hurried over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, are you hurt?” Su Yan checked Ye Zichen out worriedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his hand and caressed her long hair with a smile, “How could someone like that hurt me. I didn’t want to care about him, but he made me use violence.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Ye Zichen looked at Gao Chang, who was shuddering.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she arrived, she saw Young Master Bai get carried away by the guards. She immediately got worried that Ye Zichen would use violence on her in rage as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Don’t worry, just don’t say bad stuff about me in front of my girlfriend in the future, okay?” Although Ye Zichen asked it as a question, the firmness of his tone caused Gao Chang couldn’t help but nod like a pecking chick.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows slightly and glanced over the bystanders before holding Su Yan’s hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go, there is no meaning to this reunion anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wu Haoyu, let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ru pouted and shouted. The cool-looking Wu Haoyu instantly gained his honest look once again and followed with a nod.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, Porsche 918. Wow, who’s car is this!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ru was immediately attracted by the car just after walking out of the door. Wu Haoyu, who was on the side, frowned, then thought of Ye Zichen’s name for some reason.</span></p>
 <p><span style> “Susu, do you need us to take you back?” They walked around the Porsche a few times, then Lin Ru and Wu Haoyu walked to the only Porsche Panamera and waved towards Su Yan and Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need, he drove here,” Su Yan shook her head. Ye Zichen took out the car key and walked towards that eye-catching Porsche 918.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“See ya.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen waved towards Lin Ru and Wu Haoyu with a smile, before driving away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gao Chang, who was in the club, was completely shocked!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Porsche 918.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, she scratched her head in frustration.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What did I do!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ru was also rather shocked by this situation, but since she was someone who have seen a lot, she punched Wu Haoyu after getting stunned for a bit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Laddie, you have to work hard, Susu’s boyfriend is more amazing than you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Ye Zichen sent Su Yan back to the Su family and declined Elder Su’s visit, he went to a small coffee shop near Polytechnic University.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen hurried over, Jing Wan was taking photos with her fans within the shop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He watched it with a smile as he held his shoulders. He only walked over and sat opposite her after she took photos with all the fans.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“An internet celebrity is pretty famous, you got fans everywhere.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Wan smiled and asked the waiter to bring Ye Zichen a latte. She pursed her lips and said, “You can have it if you want as well? I can introduce you to the platform. If you stream with your level, you definitely wouldn’t have any less fans than me and will definitely have really good income.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t,” Ye Zichen twitched his mouth. “If I really want to be famous, there a lot of ways. The boss of Dream Lead invited me in person to join their company, but I turned them down as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll pretend that you’re not lying…” Jing Wan smiled while emotions surfaced in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seems like she thinks he was exaggerating. Ye Zichen sighed helplessly and said, “Internet Celebrity Jing Wan, are you really just treating me to a coffee when you called me over so anxiously?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Wan smiled and took out a file of information over from her bag.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen opened it and looked at the first page. Dream Start Gaming (DSG) Member Roster.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You really are persistent.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled helplessly, and looked at the detail information of the team members and their positions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The members of the first two positions were pretty good.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mid, Jungle, AD Carry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of them were high ranking Challenger players on Ionia, and their win rates were pretty high, while their champion pool were okay as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Ye Zichen was shocked when he saw the support.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It can’t be, you, the boss, is going on in person?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was really speechless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The starting support was actually Jing Wan herself. Of course, her team didn’t have any substitutes, but this was indeed too strange.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen played League of Legends for so long and watched so many competitions, but he has never heard of the owner of any team playing themselves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Wan blushed without saying anything. Since the team was just established, they didn’t have a full member roster.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She didn’t want to play either, it wasn’t because it was shameful for the owner of the team to play, it’s just that she wasn’t suitable to play professionally.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She could carry a few games when she’s streaming, but her level was too far off a professional one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen flipped over the page, and saw the top laner. However, Ye Zichen suddenly shook his head when he saw the player.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She’s not suited to play this position.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know how you got Xia Keke into your team. Of course, she might be pretty good, but she’s not suitable to play top. Or rather, she’s not suitable to play professionally.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why?” Jing Wan frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xia Keke is too impulsive and gets over her head. She is beyond aggressive. What’s more, she can’t accept a defeat, if anyone completely wrecks her, even if she knows she’ll die, she’ll still fight. This sort of player would become trouble in a competition.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen chucked the data back and leaned back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can’t help but praise your determination, you actually managed to establish the team after my verbal attacks. I can see your determination from this. But, you’re still too hasty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen tapped the coffee mug on the table, “A team doesn’t just require 5 players. They needed data analysts, a coach and a manager behind them. Your team doesn’t have any of them. If I put it bluntly, your team isn’t much different from children playing house.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Wan’s original confident expression already started to turn dark.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen saw all this, and although he was reluctant to do it, he continued to apply salt onto the wound.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Also, I don’t agree with Xia Keke entering your team.”</span></p>
