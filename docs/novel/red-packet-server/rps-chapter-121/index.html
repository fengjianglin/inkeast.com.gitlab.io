 <p><span style>Chapter 121 – Bai Yang sought him out</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stood on the second floor of the supermarket and pointed at the wooden bed he got from Taobao as he said to Zhuge Kongming, “This bed is seemingly kind of crappy, but it’s enough. All the linens are brand new.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhuge Kongming did not reveal any expression of disgust as he nodded his head excitedly, “Thank you, Big Brother Ye.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the background of this little fellow was unknown, his personality was rather likeable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen reached out his head and rubbed his head, then said, “There aren’t any problems with the supermarket, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is,” Zhuge Kongming frowned. “Several people came in the morning to our supermarket to ask for protection fees. I beat them up and sent them running.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You beat the ones that came to ask for protection fees and sent them away?” Ye Zichen was stunned. He didn’t think that the little guy was lying to him. People asking for protection fees were everywhere, so he was already used to it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He just didn’t think that this little fellow was rather fierce, and sent the ones that came to ask for protection fees away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, I practiced a bit with grandpa before.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before he finished, an intense knock sounded out downstairs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Ye Zichen and co. hurried over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they arrived at the entrance, Zhuge Kongming frowned, “They came again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s them? Ye Zichen’s tone was rather unfriendly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhuge Kongming also stepped forward and shouted with his hands on his waist, “Do you guys still want to get beaten up?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The people outside instantly stopped for a moment. It seems like this little fellow gave them a rather unforgettable lesson.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Bai Yang walked out from the crowd holding the bats and snorted, “Ye Zichen, if you don’t open up, then don’t blame me for being merciless.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Ye?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhuge Kongming turned around. Ye Zichen smiled and opened the door of the supermarket.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Bai.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandson, you want to submit?” Bai Yang snorted and squinted his eyes. His arm was still tied with a bandage. It was clear that the wounds at the club did not heal yet. “You took laozi a long time to find. I didn’t think that you actually hid here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm?” Ye Zichen nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing Ye Zichen’s expression as if he was being ignored, Bai Yang immediately reached over to slap him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can’t hit my Big Brother Ye.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In just a flash, Bai Yang was already sent flying like a missile. Even Ye Zichen did not manage to see Zhuge Kongming’s actions clearly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Blackie’s pupils contracted as he exclaimed, “Baji Explosion!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhuge Kongming, who lifted his head proudly, suddenly turned over and glared at Blackie with shimmering eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, this was only for a split second, so nobody noticed this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was shocked as well. This little guy’s combat abilities weren’t just a little powerful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you guys blanking out for. Smash it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is my hard work, I can’t let you guys touch it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen turned into a series of afterimages.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a few loud sounds, the delinquents that came with Bai Yang all fell onto the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen dusted his hands and squatted in front of Bai Yang, while the other person looked at him as if they were seeing a monster, “You better not touch me. Otherwise, I’ll make it so you can’t take it all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s great. I love taking food away when I can’t finish it. Only then would stuff not be wasted.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen slapped Bai Yang. This slap caused Bai Yang’s left cheek to swell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Ye, why must you do that? I said it very clearly to you the other day! What did you come here for? To take revenge?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re dead. You’re dead.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Yang pointed at Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen snapped the finger without any hesitation, while slapping him once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know whether I’m going to die. I only know that if you blabber one more useless sentence to me, you’re dead.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Ye Zichen signaled Blackie to float in front of Bai Yang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A insufferably coldness caused Bai Yang to shiver.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He stared straight at Ye Zichen, who was smiling, and submitted like a coward, “I was wrong…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Ye, let me go once.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He changed tones way too f*cking quickly, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen thought that this grandson could hold it in for several rounds, he didn’t think that this grandson would turn into a pussy so quickly and so completely!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen scratched his hair and stood up from the ground. He looked down on Bai Yang and said, “A Reason.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If Young Master Ye lets me go, then I can compensate Young Master Ye.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen lacked quite a bit of money. Without the Fiery Eyes of Truth, he didn’t have any ways to earn money recently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was Su Yiyun that had spent money for this supermarket. The money he had left on hand were all given to him by Xiao Yumei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He did require money.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How much!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A hundred thousand!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Yang crossed his two index fingers with a stutter. Ye Zichen directly kicked him and scolded, “Do you think your dog life is only worth a hundred thousand yuan?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Two hundred thousand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Another kick.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Three hundred thousand!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Yang continued to raise the price. However, Ye Zichen lacked the patience to waste time with him. He directly stuck out a finger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A million in exchange for your life. You can also bring your lackeys away with you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A million?” Bai Yang’s face was completely pale. How could he have so much pocket money on hand?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t want to repeat it. If you feel like you can’t afford it…” Ye Zichen squinted his eyes and smiled, then grabbed one of his fingers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll give… I’ll give…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Yang nearly yelled out as he clenched his teeth. He took out his phone with a tremble and shouted into the phone, “Dad, hurry up and bring me a million yuan, I…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Yang hung up the call, and resisted the pain from his fingers, “Young Master Ye, my dad will bring money to claim me soon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that so?” Ye Zichen squinted his eyes and smiled with eyes like a viper. “Why do I feel like your dad will bring people over?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Yang gulped. He did tell his dad through a code to bring people here just now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only the two of them knew about it. How could Ye Zichen know.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Bai Yang struggled internally, Ye Zichen reached out his hand and patted his shoulder, “Don’t worry, I’m kidding.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After half an hour later…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Yang’s two broken fingers nearly swelled into little buns, but Ye Zichen did not treat him with anymore violence during this time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as if he was truly waiting for Bai Yang’s dad to bring the money.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandson, it’ll be your turn to cry later,” Bai Yang glared at Ye Zichen fiercely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Jing, who floated in midair twitched her mouth, “Why did you let him be? You clearly knows that he didn’t plan to give you any money.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blackie also nodded in agreement. With Blackie’s personality, if he didn’t beat the shit out of him, it merely meant that Bai Yang had clean intestines.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who crossed his legs and sat on the chair, suddenly smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you guys know, the show’s only just begun.”</span></p>
