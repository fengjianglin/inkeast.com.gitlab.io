 <p><span style>Chapter 445 – The Final Seven Days</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen tiredly opened the door to the apartment. To no surprise, Taibai Jinxing was not inside. Recently, he and Wei Chen seemed to have come to some sort of agreement, causing the two of them to be inseparable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sat down on the sofa and let out a long sigh, since everything that happened earlier was way too confusing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter how much he thought about it, he could not understand just what the victory of the game represented. </span><i><span style>Seriously, isn’t that gramps torturing me by not telling me the reason behind everything!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Kid…” the old Dragon Old’s voice sounded out in Ye Zichen’s consciousness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows and waved towards Xia Keke, “Go and cultivate over at the old Dragon God’s. I’ll be right there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, he spoke a few words to the old Dragon God. Approximately half a minute later, Xia Keke leaned down against Ye Zichen’s shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It seems like she already entered.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen scratched his hair, then took out a cigarette from his pocket and lit it for himself, before he took out his phone and opened up the Red Packet Server.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Heavenly Court’s chat group has already been screwed. Without its active members, it was like as silent as a grave. People barely chatted in it, and even if they did, they were merely asking when their salary was going out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, in the Red Packet Server…</span></p>
 <p><span style>999+</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Chang’e seems to have come for Sky Sovereign, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mother of Lightning: Little biatch!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: Chang’e definitely came here for my older brother, alright? Do you even need to ask?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: When did Sky Sovereign become your older brother?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: Don’t not believe me. @Sky Sovereign, ge, they don’t believe that you’re my older brother!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha: I can prove that she’s telling the truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The chat chit chatted about all sorts of random things, and since Ye Zichen coincidentally saw Immortality Peach Fairy mention him, he decided to speak up in the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahem, Immortality Peach Fairy is my stepsister from now on. Great deities, please take care of her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Immortality Peach Fairy, wow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mother of Lightning: Immortality Peach biatch!</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Fortune: Immortality Peach-meimei, add me as friend. I’ll give you a huge red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: No &lt;insert a tsundere emoji&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha: @Immortality Peach Fairy, jiejie, let’s go and play ball.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was completely speechless when he saw Mother of Lightning’s message. </span><i><span style>Seriously Yang Jian, you didn’t teach other people good stuff, and actually turned “biatch” into a praise in the Heavenly Court.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sighed speechlessly, then suddenly recalled the that those people had mentioned Chang’e entering the group.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I seem to remember Yang Jian saying that the girl was going to descend, but I haven’t seen her descend in so long.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Someone sent him a private message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen exited from Red Packet Server, and saw a red “1” on Chang’e’s beautiful profile picture.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You aren’t angry, right?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why is she saying that?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was momentarily stunned, before he replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why should I be angry? What happened?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I said that I would come to find you in the lower realm, but-but a lot of things happened in the Heavenly Court recently. The Jade Emperor even decreed that we cannot go around, and there is always someone checking, so I…” Chang’e bit her lips, while her delicate face frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No wonder.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded understandingly. However, he did feel a slightly fortunate. </span><i><span style>It’s so fortunate that Chang’e didn’t descend. If she really did, then wouldn’t I be tired to death?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Worrying about the demons everyday is already tiring enough.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem, then don’t come down recently. I might return to the Three Realms after a while. It’s the same if we meet there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s great!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, Chang’e directly replied in Ye ZIchen’s mind. Ye Zichen couldn’t help but smile when he felt her joy.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>She’s so happy now, but can she still smile when she sees me for real?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh yeah, actually, I entered the group because I have some things I want to speak to you about,” Chang’e’s voice sounded out in Ye Zichen’s mind once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh? What is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bunny and I don’t have anything to do in the Moon Palace, so we tried to figure out how to make your snacks, and we succeeded recently!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Succeeded in what?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In making the snacks you are selling to the Heavenly Court! We can make things which are nearly exact, but I feel like the ingredients and craftsmanship is still a bit lacking…” Chang’e answered joyously. “Also, the presents that Yang Jian and co. gave on the Queen Mother’s feast were actually from you, right? Bunny and I made those as well, but we are just kind of slow!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Mission Issued: Establish workshops in the Heavenly Court (Including workshops for: food, daily products, cosmetics, clothes etc…)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mission Duration: 7 days</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mission Reward: Reputation x10000.</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Side Mission Issued: Donate the entire medical company.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mission Time: 7 days.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mission Reward: Reputation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Ye Zichen was exclaiming about Chang’e and Bunny’s capability, the system, directly issued him a mission to start workshops in the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is there some important connection here?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Also, about donating money, Old Man Lin just talked to me about it, and now the system directly gave me a mission. Even though it was only a side mission, it was a bit strange.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>In the words of the system, all missions are issued to pave the way for me.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>The workshops were obvious. Even if the system didn’t issue a mission, I wanted to set up workshops in the Heavenly Court already. Otherwise, it really is too troublesome to buy the stuff from the suppliers, then send them to Yue Lao using red packets.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s more, plenty of people in the Heavenly Court had already given up buying the snacks due to the ingredients used…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Although he has Taibai Jinxing’s cultivation experience, people would never mind too much money, and the same applied to Ye Zichen with cultivation experience.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>But the time is kind of tight…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Seven days!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Both mission had to be completed in seven days. It’s like it’s saying that everything will be too later afterwards.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Nameless?” Chang’e’s soft call sounded out in Ye Zichen’s consciousness again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only hen did he return to his senses and reply, “I’m here. I was dealing with some things, sorry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, if you’re busy, then I won’t disturb you. Just call me my when you’re free,” Chang’e replied softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled softly, then ended the conversation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He picked up his phone, then looked at the missions…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: Kid, stop blanking out. Hurry up. These seven days are the final time you have, so make use of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know, didn’t you write it clearly? Mission duration is seven days… I’m not blind.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: I can’t tell you in too much detail, but mark my words. You only have seven days, only… do you understand? Only seven days! You have to deal with everything you can deal with in seven days. If I am you, then I would start contacting people to buy the tools and machinery needed, then also learn from the professionals. Your time is very tight, do you understand?</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: Remember, you only have seven days!</span></p>
