 <p><span style>Chapter 493 – Marry You</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, Path of Ten Thousand Reincarnations wasn’t like its named suggested, and wouldn’t force the targets to go through ten thousand actual reincarnations. It merely created dreams.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In these dreams, Ye Zichen and Zuo Mo would meet every single ‘life’. At the same time, the moral of these dreams would be teaching them the current way of life, in order to turn them straight!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s about time, it really was unlucky for me to meet those two weirdos when I finally came over to the Three Realms.” The fatty rubbed his chin, and begun to wake Ye Zichen and Zuo Mo up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he prepared himself to see the two act more normally…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He found out that he was wrong, completely wrong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen,” Zuo Mo, who woke up from the dream, acted even more like a boy lover.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was clear that the dreams did not turn ‘him’ straight, and only made him even more bent.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This doesn’t make sense. </span></i><span style>The fatty has never met such a troublesome case after the chairman of the discipline committee for so long. </span><i><span style>You’re trying to fight back against grandpa, right? Fine, I’ll take you two back </span></i><b><i>there</i></b><i><span style> and turn you two straight.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>When it came to decency, the fatty was extremely stubborn. As long as there was something which he found indecent, even if he had a very important business to take care of, he would deal with the issue of indecency first before doing anything else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My friend, I feel like you might have misunderstood something,” Ye Zichen moved his arm away from Zuo Mo’s grasp and took a few steps forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the fatty snorted, “Don’t talk about misunderstanding. The two of you being together is a big problem. Come with me to the discipline committee!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He reached forward with his right hand, causing Ye Zichen and Zuo Mo to fly over uncontrollably, and disappear from the streets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Less than five minutes after their departure, the Treasure Tower’s guest chamberlains arrived with an array of experts in tow…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are remnants of Young Lady’s aura here. They shouldn’t have gone too far. We’ll give chase!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sat on the straw within a damp dungeon, while Zuo Mo was locked in the jail cell opposite his.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Mo sweats that that day was definitely her most humiliating day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not only did someone dare to capture her, they even locked her up in that sort of dungeon, which was so damp that it was bad for her skin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Say, when did the two of you begin?” the fatty sat in the corridor in between the two jail rooms. There was a small square table in front of him, which had some intense alcohol, and a plate of snacks to go with it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh,” Zuo Mo rolled her eyes, then sat onto the straw and did not reply. She did not want to waste anymore breath with the fatty.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The Treasure Tower’s people have already moved out. I’ll be safe soon there’s nothing for me to worry about.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Since he’s not saying anything, then you speak,” the fatty looked at Ye Zichen. At that moment, Ye Zichen was messing with his phone on the straw pile. Since he was locked up by a stranger, he naturally needed to find someone to get him out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Neither of you are speaking? Then I’ll speak,” the fatty stood up from his chair and raised his eyebrows. “Your actions are unethical, unhealthy, and unacceptable. Your actions have already severely affected mental development of several underaged people.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm, please continue,” Zuo Mo smiled coldly. Anyone familiar with her would be able to tell from her expression that she was truly angry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t argue with me. What I’m doing is for your own good,” the fatty clapped his hands and raised his eyebrows. “I’ll give you two some time to think upon your actions. When you two decide to separate, then ring the bells in front of your jail room. I’ll come and let you guys out. Of course, don’t think about trying to trick me… I can tell.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The door to the jail closed tight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who was sitting on the straw pile, raised his eyebrows and sighed softly, “Would it be all resolved if we tell him that you’re a woman? There’s no need to argue with him about all this, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why should we? Everyone has the right to love each other. For example, I’m a woman and I happen to love a woman. That’s the sort of things I feel like people should accept,” Zuo Mo said with faint disdain in her voice. “Also, that damn fatty, just look at how lecherous he looks. Chairman of the Discipline Committee? He’s just sick in the head! Indecent, he himself looks indecent!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, then what do you think we should do? We can’t exactly stay here forever.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen didn’t actually care too much about that. He was able to accept both homosexual and heterosexual people, but only if it was other people. No matter what, he was a straight guy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have to answer a question for me first,” Zuo Mo bit her lips. “If I say that I want you to marry me, will you agree?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Me marry you?” Ye Zichen pointed at himself in shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Mo nodded, “Yes, marry me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I feel like it’s hard to accept. A guy marrying a girl… I don’t mean anything else by it, I just feel like it’s too strange,” Ye Zichen shrugged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Mo asked again, “Then will you accept me marrying you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“… Do you think that I look like that kind of person that you can marry?” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes and twitched his mouth. “I’m just a poor kid that’s not worthy of the young lady of the Treasure Tower!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not a snobbish woman!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s talk about that later, the main thing right now is how we’re going to get out. Isn’t it too early to talk about whether you should marry me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s very important for me,” Zuo Mo answered anxiously. Only to find that Ye Zichen had turned silent and begun to play with his phone with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, you are the first man to reject me,” Zuo Mo curled her lips. “Don’t worry, the internal transmitter, unique to the Treasure Tower, had already sent a message when we arrived. They said that they are sending people to come and rescue us, we’ll be out in no time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s good,” Ye Zichen smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Zuo Mo smiled meaningfully. </span><i><span style>When we get out, even if I have to kidnap you, I’ll grab you to the Treasure Tower and make you marry me!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahem…” Ye Zichen coughed a few times when he noticed her strange gaze. Then, he thought back to what Zuo Mo said earlier. </span><i><span style>Making a man marry her… She really has the heart of a queen.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Beep, beep.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A soft beep suddenly sounded out in the quiet dungeon. Ye Zichen had thought that his phone rang, but saw that Zuo Mo took out a phone that was rather similar to the one Yang Jian and co. used in the Heavenly Court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Mo’s expression very quickly turned for the worse. She put her phone down and said dejectedly, “It seems like the Treasure Tower people won’t be able to come.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How come?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows in surprise. There was indeed something strange about the dungeon. His phone had no signal at all, otherwise, he would have just directly called Yang Jian and co. over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the entire time, he had been waiting for the Treasure Tower people’s rescue. However, Zuo Mo actually told him that they weren’t able to come.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pa.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Mo threw the phone over to Ye Zichen. He picked it up and looked at the message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Lady, you are in the Endless Beast Region. We can’t enter!”</span></p>
