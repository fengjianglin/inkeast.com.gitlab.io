 <p><span style>Chapter 7 – The painting in the vase</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person that brought the blue and white porcelain vase over was a suspicious looking young man, he didn’t look like anyone proper.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, the pawn shop owner looked rather kind with a beard in the shape of “八”.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing the young man’s question, the owner walked over and took the blue and white porcelain in his hands, then carefully examined it with a magnifying glass.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The blue and white porcelain was about a meter tall. When it appeared, many people came over to watch, but those that were more experienced quickly shook their heads and left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was clear that it was a fake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pawn shop owner was naturally someone who could tell. After looking at it a little and noticing that it was a fake, he lost interest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shop owner…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your blue and white porcelain is a modern forgery. Such a large fellow would just take up space in my shop, so please take it away.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shop owner, you can’t be wanting to intentionally push the price down. Just name the price, if I think it’s suitable, then I’ll sell it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The shop owner clearly wasn’t a petty person. He didn’t get angry, and instead laughed when he heard the young man say that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I, Liu Yong, rely on trust to stay in the antique street for ten odd years. You can casually take it to anyone with a bit of experience, ask them if I lied to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, many people that were a bit more experienced all sounded out their agreements.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, the young man also clearly knew that this blue and white porcelain was fake, he merely wanted to try his luck to see if he can scare anyone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, his brain might be offline, since he actually came to the antique street to try and trick people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait a sec.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stopped the young man, and pointed at the blue and white porcelain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How much do you want for it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man’s eyes shone, it seems like his luck wasn’t bad, there really was an idiot that fell for it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little fellow, his blue and white porcelain is a fake, it is also rather crudely made. It would take up a lot of space in the living room. It isn’t worth collecting at all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Yong couldn’t help but make a reminder out of good will. When the young man heard that someone wanted to destroy his business, he shouted out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You evil businessmen! You worked together with the bystanders to trick me. Right now, someone that understands the industry wants to buy it and you want to accuse me. Do you believe that I won’t pour a bucket of black dog blood onto your shop at night?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment he finished speaking, Liu Yong’s expression blanked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Businessmen did avoid this sort of stuff. What’s more, he wasn’t related to Ye Zichen at all, so all he could do was make a simple reminder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He sighed lightly, then shook his head and returned into the shop. The young man also rubbed his hands with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, how much are you preparing to pay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The pawn shop owner said that yours is a forgery just. It isn’t really fake, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pretended like he didn’t understand anything and asked carefully.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He really doesn’t understand!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The young man was really happy. It seems like no one can stop the fortune coming!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk, that old fellow just wanted to push down the price to take my vase. I’m telling you, boss. This porcelain was passed down from my ancestors, it definitely isn’t a fake.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think so too.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded like he was convinced. Hearing their conversation, the pawn shop owner let out a long sigh again. He wanted to speak up, but chose not to when he saw the young man’s stare.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My grandpa really likes blue and white porcelain, and I think yours is pretty good, so I want to buy it to for him. How much are you looking to sell it for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man raised three fingers.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Three hundred thousand. He really is greedy.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen laughed coldly in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That-That’s too expensive, right. I don’t have that much pocket money. Never mind, I’m not going to buy it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pretended to turn his head in pity and left. Seeing that scene, the pawn shop owner actually let out a sigh of relief for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, that young man got anxious.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>How could it be okay for my prey to just leave.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, say, how much can you pay. My mother is ill and urgently needing money for the treatment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man was disrespectful enough, he actually said this sort of stuff to con some money off people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s eyes flashed with coldness for a brief moment, then raised five fingers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I only have fifty thousand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fine, it’s sold to you, boss.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man acted like he was forced to give it up. Ye Zichen did not hesitate at all, and withdrew fifty thousand kuai from the bank to hand to the young man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once the blue and white vase was in his hands, Ye Zichen touched all over it like he treasured it a lot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, look at that poor and pedantic look, he’s treating a fake vase he bought as treasure.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A mocking laugh sounded out from the crowd. When Ye Zichen raised his head to look, he saw Guo Qiang standing at a place not far away, while holding Yao Yue’s waist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen didn’t pay any attention to him, and looked towards the mouth of the vase.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no doubt that this vase was fake. The purple aura should be from something within the vase.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, he couldn’t be sure of what sort of treasure was in the vase, he was betting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he lost it, then he’ll just treat it as paying for a lesson; if he won…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hehehehe!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ol’ Five, I’ve been looking for you for a while, why are you here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Su Yiyun walked over with a dignified looking man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You bought this blue and white porcelain vase?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun asked weirdly as he looked at the large case beside Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I just bought it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“For how much?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, the person that spoke wasn’t Su Yiyun, but the man beside him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun also chuckled lightly and introduced him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ol’ Five, let me introduce you. Xiao Hai, he’s definitely a super rich person.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, he also smiled towards Xiao Hai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is my bro, Ye Zichen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After both people nodded towards each other, Xiao Hai spoke once more, “How much did you buy this blue and white porcelain for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fifty thousand,” Before Ye Zichen said anything, Guo Qiang already replied with a cynical tone. “The poor is poor, treating a fake blue and white porcelain that you bought with fifty thousand kuai as treasure…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fake?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun raised his eyebrows, he completely did not understand anything about it. However, Xiao Hai, who was beside him, was an expert.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm, it’s fake. Just treat fifty thousand kuai as paying for a lesson, it’s not expensive.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Hai nodded without denying anything. Yet, Guo Qiang smiled cynically once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fifty thousand kuai indeed isn’t much for Young Master Xiao, but he earned a long time for him to get fifty thousand kuai.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun frowned. He didn’t want to pay any attention to Guo Qiang at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Qiang was known around school, and he also knew him as well. However, Guo Qiang only had just his dad’s tiny factory, so he wasn’t in his sights at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Hai also felt the strangeness in it, and raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have a grudge?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kind of, the woman beside the guy is my ex.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was rather carefree about it. Xiao Hai nodded like he understood, while his gaze towards Ye Zichen changed a bit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Yun’s friend is also the friend of mine. It seems like you’re about the same age as Xiao Yun. I’m a few years older than you, if you don’t mind, then you can call me Hai-ge. Just this blue and white porcelain as something I gifted to you. Old Huang, bring me fifty thousand kuai.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you, Hai-ge, but I can afford fifty thousand. A fake is fake, just treat it as me buying it to hear it be smashed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled carefreely, and picked up a rock from the ground to smash towards the blue and white porcelain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Neither Xiao Hai and Su Yiyun momentarily blanked, not having expected Ye Zichen to not mind it at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Xiao Hai quickly smiled.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This Ye Zichen was an interesting person.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, Guo Qiang was different…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you pretending for, you must be really hurting, right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The continuous mocking even caused Xiao Hai to be a bit unhappy. Ye Zichen had already called him Hai-ge just now, isn’t this not giving him face!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, the blue and white porcelain also cracked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the shattered china scattered onto the floor, the pieces once again proved that it was indeed a fake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The blue and white porcelain was indeed broken.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But the scroll of a painting was revealed from within the shattered remains.</span></p>
