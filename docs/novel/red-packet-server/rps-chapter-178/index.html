 <p><span style>Chapter 178 – I finally found you</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ru felt rather worried.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was too intent on venting her anger that she didn’t notice the seniors beside her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan glared fiercely at her, causing her to quickly change the topic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Happy birthday, Grandpa Su.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You finally remember me, the old man?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Man Su’s eyes were filled with meaningfulness as he swept his gaze across Ye Zichen and Su Yan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two of them quickly lowered their heads when they felt the gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ru rolled her witty and naughty eyes as she thought about how to deal with it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Elder Su, Su-dage!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Clear laughter sounded out at the manor gate, causing Su Qilong and Elder Su to turn around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hanben,” Su Qilong was stunned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The relationship between the Su family and Lin family wasn’t bad, but Su Qilong and Lin Hanben did not get along!</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Su Qilong saw Lin Ru, he thought that Lin Wei had come to congratulate Elder Su, he didn’t expect Lin Hanben!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Lin Hanben.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Ye Zichen also turned his head, and saw Lin Hanben looking towards him, while Lin Lin stood at his side!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, my grandpa is on great terms with Grandpa Su. My second uncle is using this, so just submit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Ru pouted on the side. Actually, she rather disliked her second uncle’s actions.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Begging others to help treat the patient. Begging others to help treat the patient!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The most important thing was “beg”.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the very beginning, her second uncle was unable to put himself at a lower position and kept on wanting to deal with it through different contacts. She really didn’t know if he felt her grandpa’s life was more important, or if his face was more important.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Lin Hanben also walked over following Su Qilong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two men followed behind Lin Hanben, and they worked together to carry a special stone…</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>A “寿” character could be seen from its texture lines!<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is a special stone that this brat found from outside. The character 寿 is written on its surface. So, I give it to Elder Su, and wish you a long life.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hanben, you’re really thoughtful!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Su patted Lin Hanben’s shoulder. Although he knew of the competition between his eldest son and Lin Hanben, he already didn’t care that much at this age.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He’ll just let the youngsters trouble themselves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Hanben gave the two men behind him a cue, so they quickly took the special stone away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Elder Su also laughed softly, “How’s Old Lin?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The old man is getting old, his health is getting worse and worse…” Lin Hanben shook his head and sighed with a sad expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That is natural when people turn old,” Elder Lin comforted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Hanben nodded in agreement. Then, he pretended to look to the side accidentally, “Mr. Ye, you’re also here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Hanben bowed with a surprised expression, causing Ye Zichen to squint his eyes…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>His acting was Academy Award worthy.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Director Lin truly has good eyesight. I have always been standing beside Elder Su, yet you couldn’t see me. Your eyes were truly focused!” Ye Zichen mercilessly snickered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This caused Lin Hanben’s expression to tense up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Su also felt the strangeness in the atmosphere between the two, so he couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows, “You know each other?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ai…” Lin Hanben sighed. “I won’t hide it from you. Actually, I have begged Mr. Ye to help treat our family’s old man several times, but Mr. Ye continuously refused…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Su knew about how miraculous Ye Zichen was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Hanben begging him to help wasn’t something extremely strange.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Yet, why didn’t Lil’ Ye help?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The Ye Zichen he knew wasn’t that kind of person to abandon someone in need.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Ye,” Elder Su glanced at Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Director Ye was great at pretending to be troubled. However, you saying “beg” is really problematic,” Ye Zichen laughed mockingly and swept his gaze over the Lin father and son. “Have you begged me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What does Mr. Ye mean by this!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop pretending,” Ye Zichen dragged his sentence out meaningfully with a smile. “It seems like you really want me to explain about your “begging”, then I’ll satisfy you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen directly spoke about Lin Hanben’s “begging” without any exaggeration.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, he even neglected Lin Lin’s ignorance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I understand, you came here to ask me to help, right? Then let me tell you once again. It’s impossible!” Ye Zichen smiled meaningfully, then held Su Yan’s hand and bowed towards Elder Su. “Old Man Su, I’m going in. I haven’t eaten yet, so I want to snag a bite to eat at your place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, the two people left. Then, Su Yiyuan and Lin Ru also followed after looking around a little.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Elder Su…” Lin Hanben had wanted Elder Su to say a few things, but then he looked up and saw Elder Su’s expression that was beyond dark.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hanben, begging people to others to help treat the patient! There is something really wrong with your begging. This old man can’t help you, solve the issue yourself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within the manor, Ye Zichen grabbed a piece of cake and stuffed it in his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he heard Lin Ru snort unhappily, “Ye Zichen, you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Mistress Lin, I need face as well. Just look at your second uncle, is what he’s doing even proper?” Ye Zichen replied blurrily. Then he took a cup of water from the tray of a passing waiter to drink, before starting up once more. “He’s too arrogant. I hate those sorts of people.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But my grandpa…” Lin Ru frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan also added on the side, “Zichen, the actions of Uncle Lin might be problematic, but Grandpa Lin is innocent. For my sake, can you just go and take a look? Lil’ Ru has begged you as well…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm!” Lin Ru nodded furiously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing the two girl’s actions, Ye Zichen said helplessly, “Fine, fine, if Grandpa Lin is truly unable to keep going anymore, then I’ll go and help. However, I’m not going to do anything before that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How would you know when my grandpa can’t go on anymore!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t mind so much, just tell me your grandpa’s full name.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wasn’t it simple if I wanted to know how long Old Man Lin has to live? I can just get someone from the Underworld to take a look!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, before then, he had to teach this Lin Hanben a proper lesson.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The old man’s birthday feast started.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Old Man Su taste truly gave the feel of an old official.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Eat well drink well, drink well eat well!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, the birthday feast started.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the birthday feast, Lin Hanben appeared slightly awkward. There were several times that he wanted to seek Ye Zichen out, but he was still unable to put his face down in the end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Perhaps, his face was still more important in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Ye, you seem to like this cake a lot?” Elder Su laughed softly as he held the wine gourd.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded…</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Ye Zichen, who was stuffing a piece of cake into his mouth, randomly looked backwards, while Elder Su and Su Yan, who were beside him, also turned back…</span></p>
 <p><span style>A man wearing beast-skinned clothes and stray sandals slowly walked in from the manor entrance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was strange was that nobody stopped him. Or rather, the people near where he walked past all froze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Su Yan, I finally found you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was the first thing that the man said after walking over!</span></p>
