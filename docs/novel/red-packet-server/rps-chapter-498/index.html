 <p><span style>Chapter 498 – Little Prince</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan’s expression couldn’t help but to turn for the worse when she saw Ye Zichen’s look of confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you not remember…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kind of,” Ye Zichen scratched his head with a coy smile. “I did forget, and I’m also surprised that I came at such a coincidental time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Seriously, would it have killed you to have answered that you didn’t!?” Su Yan rolled her eyes. Then, when she saw that Ye Zichen continued to smile coyly, she couldn’t help but sigh. “Alright, I’m not blaming you. But, you must come the day after tomorrow. If you don’t, then… Hmmph!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but to nod with a smile when he saw Su Yan’s cute wrinkled nose, then promised with certainty, “I’ll definitely be there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good, Keke will definitely be very happy then. But poor Lu Lu, she snuck over to Maple City to look for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did she go over there for?” Ye Zichen had a confused expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan said with a hint of jealousy, “To give you a surprise.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, the two continued the video chat for a long while until Su Yan was beyond sleepy. Since she had to prepare to be the birthday star of the day after tomorrow, she chose to rest first.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she still repeatedly reminded Ye Zichen that he had to be there at her birthday party.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Naturally, Ye Zichen promised he would be there. Only after he had done so did Su Yan end the video chat to sleep without worries.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>If I want to head over to the Nine Tail Fox clan’s place, I definitely have to trouble my dear comrade Lil’ White…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Otherwise… Since I don’t know my way around here at all, god knows when I would actually find them…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I might even be captured and treated as a pet before I get there.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen turned his gaze to the Heavenly Court chat group. It could be said that he had witnessed the flourish and downfall of the group in person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The chat group, which could have reached 99+ messages in mere moments, actually hadn’t even had 99 new messages in a month.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen took a look at the members list, the number of members decreased from the initial several hundred people to less than a hundred people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for where all these people went…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Red Packet Server.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had already become the second Heavenly Court chat group. All of the deities would chit-chat. </span><i><span style>Wait, they don’t seem like they’re chit-chatting…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: Huge bonus at a new business. @everyone, our Heavenly Court’s clothing store has officially opened. Everything will be twenty percent off for this month. Those who spend ten thousand will be given a three hundred coupon. There are also lottery events at the end of each month. Don’t miss this chance! We await your arrival…</span></p>
 <p><span style>That message alone was sent a total of ten-odd times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, when his advertisement finally stopped, Blue Lotus Fairy suddenly popped up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blue Lotus Fairy: Makeup lessons are officially starting. Do you want your skin to be pure white? Do you want to be the center of attention like Chang’e? Scan the QR code on the screen and join our Makeup &amp; Cosmetics group. Women, actually, you’ve always been beautiful!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long after she sent the message, it was already pushed off the screen by various post. Despite that, there were still plenty of people who requested to join the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder has entered this group by scanning the QR code.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal has entered this group by scanning the QR code.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Fortune has entered this group by scanning the QR code.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Barefoot Immortal has entered this group by scanning the QR code.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ahem…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s all men…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Why did you guys all come…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: Shouldn’t the ones coming here all be girls? What did you animals enter for?</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Fortune: Bullshit, we came to look at girls as well!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The men in the group immediately started arguing, but as that happened, another person entered the group by scanning the QR code.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Little Prince has entered this group by scanning the QR code.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder and co. all laughed when they saw a new member enter the group. If there was no surprise, then this person calling himself the Little Prince probably entered to look at girls as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: @Little Prince, bro, you got tricked as well. There are only guys in this group so far.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Fortune: Everybody was screwed over by Blue Lotus.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: Ai…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, everyone in the group starting complaining about how they were tricked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, only five minutes after the Little Prince entered the group did he finally send a message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Little Prince: Why are you guys here chatting and wanting to look at girls instead of doing your job properly? Do you not want your year-end bonuses anymore?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The scolding tone completely stunned God of Thunder and the rest, and only after a long while, did God of Fortune break the silence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Fortune: Is this brat scolding us?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: You’ve got guts. You actually dare to scold us? Look at his name, it’s a fake name as well. I just took a peek at his Moments and they’re closed off to public.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: You came to act cocky, and is pretending to be some kind of bigshot? Year-end bonus… Can you decide whether we get our year-end bonus?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Barefoot Immortal: Interesting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Little Prince: Do you guys know who this sovereign is? You actually dare to speak to me like this!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: Go and show off somewhere else. Are you even more amazing than my Monkey Bro? He even dares to beat up the Jade Emperor. Tell us your celestial position if you dare…</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Fortune: Yeah. Little bro, look at big brother’s celestial position. It’s the God of Fortune! All of your salary is from me. You actually dare to scare me with year-end bonus.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: Agreed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Little Prince: Zhao Gongming, do you not want to be the head of the Five Gods of Wealth anymore? Leizhenzi, did you have enough of being a general? Do you need this sovereign to retract your command over the military?</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Fortune: … You’re insane! You’re actually pretending to be the Jade Emperor now? Even though I don’t know who your main account is, laozi definitely will have to screenshot this and report it to the Jade Emperor!</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Fortune: Ignore this retard. He just came to get attention. Bros, let’s ignore him and go play cards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, the members of the team left the group one by one. Even though God of Fortune and them spoke rather mercilessly, they all held important positions in the Heavenly Court, so they really weren’t afraid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, the group turned silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen thought about it for a moment, then decided to send a message to calm the Little Prince down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t take it to heart. They didn’t actually mean what they said.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, when Ye Zichen saw that the Little Prince didn’t reply, he thought that the guy went off to get angry on his own. Yet, the moment he left the group chat, he noticed that someone had sent him a friend request.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Little Prince has sent you a friend request.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Ye Zichen didn’t know what the Little Prince sent him a friend request for, he still accepted all the friend requests he received from the Heavenly Court people. </span><i><span style>After all, didn’t the system tell me to earn quite a bit more in intimacy levels?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Accept.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen took a look at their initial intimacy level, and to no surprise, it was Friendly as usual.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Only Idealism. Your name is called Only Idealism?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Little Prince had sent a text message and not a voice message, for some reason, Ye Zichen could still feel the arrogant attitude from just the words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What about it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who told you to name yourself that!?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is this guy insane?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but roll his eyes at the question. </span><i><span style>What in the world does my name have to do with this brat? What’s more, I didn’t even say anything when I saw the name Little Prince…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“How’s that any of your business? Seriously, no wonder God of Thunder and co. scolded you. You were born with such a big head.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen deleted Little Prince from his friend list and quit WeChat.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I can’t be bothered with that sort of retard!</span></i></p>
 <p></p>

 <p><b>Su Yan:&nbsp;</b>Did you forget?</p>
