 <p><span style>Chapter 84 – Affability Level that flew up</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Shengmei bit her lips in annoyance as she looked at Ye Zichen, who was looking down and playing with her phone, just now…</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was just about to ask that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He actually told her to wait in order to go on WeChat?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen didn’t care about that much. He opened WeChat, then saw Nezha looking for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha: &nbsp;Hey.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha: Say something. Hey.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen could imagine just how cute his expression was as he looked at the third prince’s moe shota profile pic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is the third prince seeking this little deity for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen asked in a testing manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you send red packets when I was dragon slaying? Don’t try to lie to me, Immortality Peach Fairy-jiejie told me everything.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but smile when a moe shota profile pic user used such a moe tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This little deity did send it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Make it up to me. I also want to drink that, but I won’t make you do it for free. I can exchange with you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Exchange.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s eyes sparkled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Don’t just think that the Third Prince Nezha is moe, he was a top existence in the Heavenly Court. If he wanted to exchange for it, then it definitely wouldn’t be anything that bad.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is the Third Prince saying, it’s just a red packet. I’ll just make it up to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Coincidentally, there was an unopened bottle of Nutri-Express on Huang Shengmei’s table. He directly scanned it and sent it over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Shengmei looked at what happened in shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck, crap.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen silenly exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was too concentrated on making up to Nezha with a red packet, he forgot about there being someone else that didn’t know anything in the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen knew that she definitely saw it from Huang Shengmei’s expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had to turn her into one of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was Ye Zichen’s only thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry, I’ll explain it to you later,” Ye Zichen wasn’t too anxious even in this situation. No matter what, Huang Shengmei was someone he had a marriage string with.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he can’t explain it properly later, he’ll just take her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for how he’ll explain it to the other women at his side, that’ll have to wait!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at his WeChat and saw that the Third Prince Nezha had already received his third packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is Nutri-Express? What you gave Immortality Peach Fairy-jiejie doesn’t seem to be this,” The moe third prince expressed his confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Third Prince might not know, this is of a much higher class than what I sent them. This would sell for 400 cultivation experience per bottle, theirs was only 300 cultivation experience.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, oh, oh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since the third prince was innocent, he didn’t seem to mind what Ye Zichen said just now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, Ye Zichen received the system’s notification.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your intimacy level with Third Prince Nezha increased by 50. Current intimacy level: 150.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, that was good. You really didn’t lie to me. Since you were so nice to me, I can’t treat you shabbily.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A red packet immediately appeared on the sscreen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clicked and received the red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fragment of Soul Pearl Yiyuan x1</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was another fragment of Soul Pearl Yiyuan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He already has 4 fragments now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I heard from Immortality Peach Fairy-jiejie that you got three fragments of Soul Pearl Yiyuan. I coincidentally found one while I was dragon slaying in the dragon’s nest, so I’ll give it to you. I’m telling you, this Soul Pearl Yiyuan is an ancient spiritual item, you can definitely be super powerful in the Heavenly Court if you manage to get it.</span></p>
 <p><em><span style>So moved.</span></em></p>
 <p><span style>The Third Prince is such a good deity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He actually gave such an important treasure to him, but…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The hell?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Even if Nezha gave him the fragment, Ye Zichen still required two more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had looked around the Treasure Shop when he got these fragments, but he didn’t find any sign of fragments of Soul Pearl Yiyuan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Perhaps the Soul Pearl Yiyuan was spiritual item that would invoke the deities’ envy, but isn’t it useless if he doesn’t manage to gather all of them?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you, Third Prince.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter what, the Third Prince Nezha did it out of good will. After Ye Zichen thanked him, the Third Prince sent him a smiley face, then disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You seemed to be chatting with Nezha?” Huang Shengmei asked in a testing manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She suddenly felt like she might have woken up on the wrong side of the bed, that’s why she got into all sorts of weird situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Nutri-Express on her table randomly disappeared, and she saw someone chatting with Nezha.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, what to do. She seems to know it all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing also spoke up. Ye Zichen licked his lips, then put his phone onto Huang Shengmei’s table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have a look.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that okay?” Although Huang Shengmei said that, her hands still moved towards the phone uncontrollably.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She really was just too curious about how the drink disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Also, what’s with the Third Prince Nezha.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment she looked at the phone, she saw that the person Ye Zichen was chatting with just now was really Nezha. More importantly, he was also in a group, where everyone in the group had the name of a deity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can’t tell anyone what you saw today, understood?” Ye Zichen walked in front of Huang Shengmei and said, while his nose almost touched hers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Shengmei immediately blushed, while her heart also started to beat erratically.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your affability level with Huang Shengmei increased by 50. Current affability level: 60.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your affability level with Huang Shengmei increased by 50. Current affability level: 110.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The indication of their affability level popped up several more times, and only stopped when it reached their affability level reached 490.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I definitely wouldn’t tell anyone,” Huang Shengmei’s eyes were filled with determination.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although she still didn’t get what was going on, Ye Zichen showed her his phone due to him trusting her. She definitely can’t betray his trust for her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good,” Ye Zichen reached out to caress Huang Shengmei’s hair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Liu Qing twitched her mouth on the side, “Flagrant, brazen, shameless.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen ignored that mistress’s mockery. He also understood that this sort of method wasn’t good, but he had no other choice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If the secret was actually leaked, don’t talk about other people, it was already unknown if that Taibai Jinxing would let him off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for feelings, that can be developed later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Isn’t there a lot of situations where people did things first, then got to know each other?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t do anything yet, so there was no rush to develop their feelings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uhm, just now, someone called the Canopy Marshal sent you a friend request on your phone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qing pointed at the phone on the table. Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows, then quickly picked it up, sat back on the chair and crossed his legs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Indeed, the Canopy Marshal had sent him a friend request.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But this profile pic was truly worthy of retorts. He was looking amazing in a golden armor.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This isn’t f*cking like the Zhu Bajie from what he knows, okay!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Never mind, he couldn’t care about so much. So many people used fake profile pics on the internet, who said the people in the Heavenly Court can’t use them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What’s more, the Canopy Marshal might have used a photo editing app!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Accept.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately looked at their intimacy level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>100.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Friendly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seems like the ones that send friend requests would all have at least a Friendly intimacy level. Only Erlang Shen was different, but they somehow managed to become sworn brothers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Without knowing the other person’s purpose, Ye Zichen could only send a question mark in a testing manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sovereign, you finally add I, Old Pig.”</span></p>
