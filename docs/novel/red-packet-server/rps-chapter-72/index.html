 <p><span style>Chapter 72 – Repay me with your body</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the First People’s Hospital’s special ward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen twitched his mouth and sat on the bed, while both Huang Shengmei and Ye Rong stood within the ward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It could be said that he was truly scolded terribly by these two people. What’s more, Huang Shengmei had kept on exaggerating things, causing Ye Zichen to worry that Ye Rong would just tie him up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Auntie Ye, you also know the situation of the patient. It was a gun shot wound. If he wasn’t lucky enough for the bullet to get stuck at the collar bone, then it might have penetrated the entire shoulder. He actually went out with this sort of injury…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Shengmei had already nearly died of anger when Ye Zichen made a face at her when he had escaped. Now, Ye Rong’s also held an angry expression, she was at the height of her anger for Ye Zichen sneaking out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Doctor Huang, don’t worry. I’ll watch him personally, and not let what happened today happen again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Ye Zichen saw that Huang Shengmei actually made a victory sign with her hands towards him. Her proud look made it seem like she had just won a war.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen reached out a finger towards her, but was slapped down by Ye Rong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Doctor Huang is doing it for your own good. You can’t leave this ward at all without permission from now on, do you understand?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen muttered like a balloon letting out air as he gazed at Ye Rong’s angry look, “I understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then that’s it, Auntie Ye. I’ll be leaving first. Just come and find me any time if you have any questions.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ve troubled you, Doctor Huang.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Rong walked towards Ye Zichen in rage after sending Doctor Huang out of the war.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was wrong.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen quickly lowered his head to admit his mistakes. Only an earnest attitude admitting his mistake could get the least punishment in this situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, hurry up and sleep. You should be tired after messing around for that long outside.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Rong sighed and covered Ye Zichen with a blanket.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The entire night passed by silently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s phone started ringing intensely beside his pillow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who is it, it’s so late…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sleepily put the phone in front of him…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>White Impermanence!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>White Impermanence?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, he lost all his sleepiness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>White Impermanence: Are you there?</span></p>
 <p><span style>White Impermanence: Can you chat with me for a while?</span></p>
 <p><span style>White Impermanence: &lt;insert image&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen took a look at the picture that she sent and saw that it was a photo of a voluptuous girl with gold hair and pearl-colored eyes. The only thing that the girl was wearing was two bands of white cloth around her body…</span></p>
 <p><span style>White Impermanence: Do you think I look good wearing this?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was stunned.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Stop messing around, this is White Impermanence?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>When Ye Zichen thought back to when they met, he didn’t notice that she was so busty.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It was definitely a picture stolen from the internet.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was certain of that. If this was truly White Impermanence, and Black Impermanence was still cheating on her, then wasn’t there something wrong with his brain!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen then ignored whether or not the one in the picture of her, that wasn’t important. The important thing is that he needed to enter the inner circle of the Underworld through White Impermanence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He took a glance at their intimacy level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>200.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Trusted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He never would have thought that their intimacy level was so high, it was the same as his intimacy level with Erlang Shen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen thought about it, then replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Yes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>White Impermanence: Really? &lt;insert embarrassed emoji&gt;. It’s fine if you like it.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ugh.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why is it fine if I like it?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s was speechless, so he quicky changed the topic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Why aren’t you sleeping in the middle of the night? Don’t you know that it is bad for the skin when women stay up late?</span></p>
 <p><span style>White Impermanence: We sleep in the morning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen instantly understood, people of the Underworld were all active at night, it was truly different from his own.</span></p>
 <p><span style>White Impermanence: Did I disturb your rest?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Nope. What do you want to chat with me about? Did Black Impermanence bully you again?</span></p>
 <p><span style>White Impermanence: He didn’t bully me. He just went out to work. I’m a bit bored just staying here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen: Shouldn’t you two be working together?</span></p>
 <p><span style>White Impermanence: No, ever since we left your place, he applied to change partners with the higher-ups.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>So this means that that Black and White Impermanence of the Underworld weren’t unique.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, it made sense when he thought about it. There were so many dead people, wouldn’t it tire them out if there was only one pair of Black and White Impermanence?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen chatted with White Impermanence for more than two hours, about everything from relationships to their lives.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that it was about to be day time, White Impermanence sent a message over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>White Impermanence: Thank you for chatting so much with me. I feel much better now. I’m going to rest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your intimacy level with White Impermanence increased by 20. Current intimacy level: Trusted 220.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had no strength left to retort when he saw this message. She felt great, but he was about to die of tiredness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was fortunate that he didn’t chat for nothing that night, he managed to increase the intimacy level by 20.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The higher the intimacy level was, the easier it will be when he asks her to enter the group later. When that happens, he’ll earn stuff from both the Underworld and the Heavenly Court!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen then sleepily fell asleep once again. When he opened his eyes, it was already noon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re awake?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen thought that the person beside his bed would either be Ye Rong or Liu Qing, but it was actually Officer Lin, who sat on the side of his bed, while looking at him with a complex look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you here? Your wounds healed?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Officer Lin was still wearing a hospital gown, but seeing her red face, it seemed like she was fine.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“More or less.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Officer Lin handed a peeled tangerine over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen snickered, “Officer Lin, you probably have never taken care of a patient before, right? You’re telling me to eat a tangerine when I just woke up, are you really not afraid of me getting inflamed?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whatever if you don’t eat it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Officer Lin took back the tangerine and placed a segment into her mouth. Ye Zichen put the pillow behind him and leaned against it as he watched her tangerine-chewing mouth, before slowing moving his gaze down.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just what did this woman eat growing up? It could actually get so big.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen thought about it as he looked. When Officer Lin saw this, her expression immediately turned cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you see enough?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not yet…” Ye Zichen answered subconsciously, but when he feel the gaze that could kill him, he quickly corrected himself. “I saw enough.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then retract your lecherous gaze.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, alright.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked away with a coy smile, then placed his arms behind his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did Officer Lin come here for? Is it to repay the favor? I heard that women would repay favors with their bodies in ancient times, is Officer Lin the same? If it’s true, then that’s amazing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Officer Lin subconsciously wanted to get mad, but when she saw the bandages around Ye Zichen’s shoulder, she suppressed the flames of anger within her heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I did come to thank you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh? It’s true?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows and smiled naughtily. “Then Officer Lin is ready to repay me with her body?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not kidding with you. I did come to thank you. Thank you for taking the shot for me, despite the danger and saving me,” Officer Lin bit her lips, while her voice became quieter and quieter. “How do you want me to repay you? As long as I can do it, I will satisfy you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehehehe…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who was lying on the bed, suddenly laughed naughtily and said, “Since Officer Lin said that, then I would be offending you if I was too courteous. You want to repay me, right? Then… repay me with your body.”</span></p>
