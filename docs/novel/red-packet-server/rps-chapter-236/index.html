 <p><span style>The Ten Yama Kings of the Underworld sat in a circle, while their expressions all looked solemn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“King Chujiang, are you sure about that master collecting all fragments of Soul Pearl Yiyuan, and that Soul Pearl Yiyuan has remained in his hands?” The big brother of the Ten Yama Kings, King Qinguang, asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, I’m sure,” King Chujiang nodded with certainty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“About this… Ksitigarbha had said before that Soul Pearl Yiyuan is already a spiritual item, and no one other than the Yellow Emperor can gather all of the fragments of Soul Pearl Yiyuan. Wouldn’t that mean that the person that had been dealing with us is the Yellow Emperor!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I called everyone over because I had thought of that possibility,” King Chujiang’s expression was solemn. “Big Bro, what should we do!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I went to find Ksitigarbha, as for the identity of that master, don’t mention it to others. The Rogue Immortals have no huge grudge with us, the Underworld. If that master is truly the reincarnation of the Yellow Emperor, then if we can get on good terms with him beforehand, and possibly get the Rogue Immortals to come to our side!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The medical company that Xiao Yumei established finally got all the papers through using Su Yiyun’s influence, thus officially establishing the company.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The day that the company was offically established, they did not go around to invite people from all sorts of industries, since this medical company was using a marketing plan that wasn’t going to see the light of day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since I need some extra time in advance to exchange the pills, so I can only exchange for two hundred right now. Is that enough to start with?” Ye Zichen had used two hundred pills to cover the entire desk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei smiled, “It’s definitely enough. Don’t underestimate these two hundred pills.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei picked up a jade bottle and cradled it in her hands, “Do you know how much medicine we sell to the outside that can be diluted from a single pill?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How much?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A thousand,” Xiao Yumei lifted a finger with a smile. “And this is the level of dilution with a speedy recovery. Otherwise, it’s possible to actually dilute it to ten thousand pills…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…” Ye Zichen was stunned, he didn’t have any idea about that at all, but from how Xiao Yumei talked, it seemed rather amazing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sat down on the office sofa and raised his eyebrows, “That Huo Da hasn’t come to harass you recently, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huo Da?’ Xiao Yumei blanked out for a moment, then shook her head. “Ever since that one time, I haven’t seen him again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s good…” Ye Zichen smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What they didn’t know was that…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within a smoky and messy living room, which had an unexplainable feeling of oppression, that had its blinds shut so tightly that not even a sliver of light passed through…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An expensive phone was thrown onto the floor and was smashed into smithereens. At the same time, the door of the room was pushed open, letting a hint of light in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master, you can’t be like this!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>An old man in a butler uniform walked in front the outside while holding a walking stick. The eyes of Huo Da, who sat on the sofa, were bright red. He forcefully put out a cigarette in the ashtray and frowned, “How was it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I just came to tell you that the medical company belonging to the third young mistress of the Xiao family has been established. The drug administration was not able to stop it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The heck is Fu doing? He can’t even do something so simple!” Huo Da howled like a wild beast.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The old butler frowned slightly, then continued to answer calmly, “Someone from Bingcheng’s Su family spoke up…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huo Da smacked the sofa with his fist, then stood up with his clenched teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Su family! That woman, Xiao Yumei, even after she left the Xiao family, she still would get so many helpers!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master, one more thing…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I understand,” Huo Da used his finger to swipe his dark purple lips. “Ignore Xiao Yumei’s medical company for now, let’s go back to the capital first!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay, then I’ll go and prepare the return tickets.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long after the old butler left the room, he heard another period of things being smashed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He slowly lifted the corner of his lips, while a hint of disdain surfaced on his smiling face, “Retard!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong dong dong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sound of knocking sounded out outside the office.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei, who was getting intimate with Ye Zichen, quickly separated from him and coughed, “Come in!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Shuang walked in from the outside. When she saw Ye Zichen, whose clothes were unorganized, and Xiao Yumei, whose face was slightly flushed…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mei… jie…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Xiao Yumei noticed the awkwardness on Li Shuang’s face, she glared at Ye Zichen fiercely, then replied, “What is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s like this. There’s a girl calling herself Director Ye’s classmate outside. She said she’s called Lu Lu.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was instantly stunned.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why did she come here?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry up and see. Lu Lu, that seems like a new name!” Xiao Yumei looked at him meaningfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen laughed dryly, then stood up from the sofa, “I’m going to go and take a look.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Li Shuang, who was standing at the room entrance, was about to take him over, Xiao Yumei, who was in the office, twitched her mouth and smiled, “Shuang’er, don’t go over, isn’t that going to stop our Director Ye from doing proper business?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei placed a lot of emphasis on “proper business”, causing Ye Zichen, who was walking outside, to instantly run towards the entrance of the medical company’s office.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the lobby of the medical company, Lu Lu wore a rather vintage baby blue dress, with a ribbon tied at her waist, causing her body to seem extremely beautiful. What’s more, her eye-catching red hair, had also turned into a normal black.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, Tall Guy,” Lu Lu smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who had wanted to ask her why she came to this place with a look of speechlessness, froze on the spot.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This scene is strangely familiar.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Guo Xiang, wait for me,” a young man wearing a blue shirt and holding a blue-covered book ran out of the Shaolin Temple.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?” The girl frowned while she held the reins to a white horse.</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>“Look!” The young man opened the secret scripture in his hands, while the words “In-Room Techniques” <a id="footnoteref-2" href="#footnote-2">[2]</a> were extremely eye-catching. “I stole this from Eldest Senior Brother, do you want to practice it with me?”</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The girl flushed, then hit the young man on the head with her fist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zhang Junbao, you’re shameless!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did you hit me? If you don’t want to, then just don’t!” The young man twitched his mouth as he caressed his pained head. Then he stuffed the booklet into his clothes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, a happy expression surfaced on the young man’s face again, and walked next to the girl, “Xiang’er, I really like you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ugh…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The girl’s fist clenched even tighter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pa.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The girl punched the guy, causing him to gain a panda eye, while she leaped on the white horse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zhang Junbao, if you have that kind of time, learn things from the abbot properly. Right now, the world is rather chaotic, you can only go through it if you have some actual ability. For someone like you… Heh, I don’t care about you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, the girl slowly rode the white horse away. The young man stood blankly on stop for a long time, then displayed a joyous expression on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Guo Xiang, I just asked my shifu. He said that I’m a disciple of the mundane world, so I can marry. After I get famous, how about you marry me to be my wife?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ll talk about it when you get famous!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Famous.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at Lu Lu, who was standing in front of him, blankly, while a smile appeared in his eyes like one that the young man in his memory has.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Guo Xiang!”</span></p>
 <p></p>

 <p><strong>King Qinguang:&nbsp;</strong>King Chujiang, are you sure that he has all the fragments of Soul Pearl Yiyuan on hand, and he was the one who collected them all?</p>
 <p><strong>King Chujiang:&nbsp;</strong>Yes, I'm sure of it.</p>
 <p><strong>King Qinguang:&nbsp;</strong>Ksitigarbha has once said that the only person that can collect all the fragments and reform Soul Pearl Yiyuan is the Yellow Emperor! Are you saying that we've been talking to him all along!?</p>
 <p><strong>King Chujiang:&nbsp;</strong>That's exactly what I'm thinking right now, and the reason I've called this meeting.</p>
 <p><strong>Yama King A:&nbsp;</strong>You mean the guy that save big bro, then threatened us is actually the Yellow Emperor!? What should we do?</p>
 <p><strong>Yama King B:&nbsp;</strong>Hmm, intriguing. Big bro, what do you think we should do?</p>
 <p><strong>King Qinguang:&nbsp;</strong>It's pretty simple really. All our dealings with him were pretty much just exchanges. We haven't really offended him or anything. Also, since we're not exactly on terrible terms with the Immortal Region, we should be very nice to him now so that we can get them on our side!</p>
