 <p><span style>“Mr. Ye,” the lady suddenly spoke to Ye Zichen, causing the latter to be stunned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it? Do you have some sort of business with me?” Ye Zichen stopped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The lady wanted to say something, but merely shook her head with a smile in the end, “Nothing, please be careful on your way.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at the woman in confusion, but she maintained a faint smile on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rubbed his nose and left the teahouse. He did not pay any heed to what the lady said, and directly drove towards the Maintaining Beauty headquarters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I hope you will keep what I said in mind. Seriously, I’m getting old and getting kinder,” the lady shook her head slowly with a sigh several minutes after Ye Zichen left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the Maintaining Beauty Building.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen and Xiao Yumei had said that they would get dinner together, but when Ye Zichen drove over to get her, he saw her rushing outside hurriedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yumei,” Ye Zichen waved towards her with a soft smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei paused for a moment, then remembered that they were supposed to have dinner together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zichen, sorry, I have some urgent business to deal with. I can’t have dinner with you tonight!” Xiao Yumei said apologetically. “Oh yeah, you drove over, right? Let me have the car for a bit, Li Shuang borrowed mine!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Here!” Ye Zichen’s face was filled with helplessness as he handed the car keys over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Yumei tiptoed and pecked his cheek, “Don’t be angry, I’ll make it all up to you next time!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The flirtatious gaze and smile instantly caused the flames of lust in Ye Zichen’s body to rise up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen could only silently comment on how she was a fairy, while sighing helplessly, “Alright, I get it. Hurry up and busy yourself, my Goddess of Fortune!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Ye Zichen watch Xiao Yumei drive off, he could only sigh. He finally understood what it felt like for his partner to be a strong woman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye ZIchen stretched lazily, and just as he pondered about what he should go and do…</span></p>
 <p><span style>A silver sports car stopped in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun, who was wearing sunglasses, whistled towards Ye Zichen, “Ye-zi, what are you wandering around here for? Want to come and go around with big bro for a bit?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes in response to the intense rich second-generation aura and raised his eyebrows, “For what?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you asking so much? Just get in the car!” Su Yiyun glanced towards the front seat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen thought about it. </span><i><span style>Since I have nothing to do, I might as well go around with him.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is this place that you brought me to?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but gasp at the parking lot full of fancy cars.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun smiled faintly and hook his arm and Ye Zichen’s shoulders, “What are you getting worried for, come with big bro. Do you think I’ll sell you out? What’s more, it’s all too simple if you want to come to these sorts of places, it’s just that no one knows that the medical company belongs to you since you pushed Xiao Yumei into the light.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they reached the clubhouse lobby, Su Yiyun handed a card to a waiter beside them and begun to lead Ye Zichen in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir!” The waiter quickly ran over and blocked their path with a smile. “Could that gentleman show his membership card please?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dude, you deliberately came to annoy me, right?” Su Yiyun raised his eyebrows. “Is my card not enough?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mr. Su, you did show your membership card, but this gentleman has not yet,” The waiter smiled humbly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you new? Don’t you know who I am?” Su Yiyun pointed at his nose. “I can’t even bring someone in with the name of Su Yiyun?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yo, Young Master Su! What happened? Why are you so angry?” At that moment, playful laughter rang out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Qi walked over with several people that seemed like youngsters of rich families. His hand was still wrapped in a bandage, making it seem like his broken finger had not yet healed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Han Qi?” Su Yiyun’s face was filled with disdain. He might have looked at him properly if it had been Han Yu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Han Qi…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was not enough.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun disregarded Han Qi’s mockery and squinted his eyes at the waiter, “Are you sure that you’re going to block me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The waiter revealed a troubled look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Qi immediately spoke up on the side, “This sort of place is not for everyone. You guys have to watch over it properly. Do not fear brute force!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Han Qi, I’m slightly regretting not causing your entire jaw to dislocate. Come over here, let's have a good chat,” Ye Zichen squinted his eyes, causing Han Qi’s face to immediately stiffen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You want to hit me? I’m telling you, this sort of place isn’t for all sorts of little shits. Someone who can’t even display a membership card… Hehe…” Han Qi put up a brave front, but as he said so, he continued to ensure that he maintained a fair distance from Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Han Qi, if you don’t want to get beaten, then shut your damn mouth,” Su Yiyun raised his eyebrows, then looked at the waiter. “I do understand the rules here, but isn’t there also one about how if someone a member brings is of a certain level or above, that person would get an automatic membership?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!” The waiter nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then he’s the one I brought over, is his level not enough?” Su Yiyun questioned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You alone are not enough proof,” the waiter answered fearlessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hahaha, Young Master Su is in trouble. Zeze…” Han Qi laughed manically on the side and mocked. “I’m telling you, the brat beside Young Master Su isn’t even a little shit…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t that Big Brother Ye?” a questioning voice sounded out from the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, Xiao Hai and Huang Ming walked over, side by side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ Ye!” Xiao Hai raised his eyebrows and smiled. “Why haven’t you come over to Hai-ge’s for so long? I’ve missed you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Following them, Lin Hanben also hurried over when he heard them. He bowed and smiled towards Ye Zichen, “Mr. Ye.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Ye is actually here as well…” Dongfang Wenyi also walked over passionately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why is it so crowded here?” At that moment, Zu Siliang also walked over with a smile. When he saw Ye Zichen, who stood at the entrance, he raised his eyebrows with a smile. “When did Brother Ye come, why are you just standing here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In a mere ten minutes, several big shots gathered at the entrance to the clubhouse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The waiter was completely stunned, while Han Qi’s expression was truly terrible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had just said that Ye Zichen wasn’t even a little shit, but now everyone that knew him were peak existences in their circles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s so fortunate that you all came!” Su Yiyun snorted meaningfully before Ye Zichen even had the chance to utter a word. “I brought Ye-zi to come out and play, but I was blocked off by this guy. He said that my identity cannot prove that Ye-zi can become a member here. But this guy is just doing things according to regulations. On the other hand, this grandson…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yiyun indicated towards Han Qi with his mouth, “This grandson was adding fuel to the fire and said that Ye-zi isn’t even a little shit… Hehe… I really can’t stand it anymore!”</span></p>
