 <p><span style>Chapter 234 – The God of Fortune Borrowing Cultivation Experience.</span><span style>The world instantly turned a lot more peaceful.</span><span style>Ye Zichen stretched lazily and left the bedroom with a satisfied look, when he saw that Yu had already kneeled down in the doorway.</span><span style>“Stand up and speak.”</span><span style>“Thank you so much. I owe you for this favor.”</span><span style>Yu’s gaze was full of sincerity. Ye Zichen side and helped him up from the floor, then exchanged cultivation experience for two Spring-Returning Pills, which he chucked into Yu’s hands.</span><span style>“These are for you. It might help Zhang Lingling when she wakes up.”</span><span style>“These… Are too valuable,” Yu hesitated and did not accept the pills.</span><span style>Ye Zichen acted like he was angry, “Just take it if I tell you to! Why are you so troublesome?!”</span><span style>“Then, I thank you,” Yu nodded thankfully.</span><span style>Towards this, Ye Zichen smiled. Then he crossed his legs and took out a cigarette, which he lit for himself before raising his eyebrows, “How is it? What has Huo Da done recently?”</span><span style>“He…” Yu squinted his eyes. “He doesn’t seem to have done anything recently, but I did hear some news about you outside his door last time.”</span><span style>“About me?” Ye Zichen was stunned, then asked curiously. “What did you hear?”</span><span style>When Ye Zichen returned home from Yu’s place, his face was full of a faint mocking smile.</span><i><span style>That brat, Huo Da, is truly rather capable. I had thought that it was just the Drug Administration being insatiable, but in the end, he was acting that way because of Huo Da.</span></i><span style>He wants Xiao Yumei to go and beg him…</span><span style>Haha!</span><span style>He probably never dreamed that the number one young master in Bingcheng invested in Xiao Yumei’s medical company.</span><span style>“Boss Ye,” Third Fatty Jin ran over flatteringly with a plate of fruits. Ye Zichen glanced at him…</span><span style>He seems to have gotten fatter.</span><span style>“Say, Fatty, it’s not good that you stay at my place every day like a lord,” Ye Zichen picked up an apple from the fruit plate and took a bite. “I’m not criticizing you, but look at your fat…”</span><span style>“Boss, what do you think I should do?”</span><span style>“You…”</span><span style>Dingdong.</span><span style>The phone on the tea table vibrated. Third Fatty Jin picked up it to have a look.</span><span style>“Boss, the God of Fortune mentioned you in the group!”</span><i><span style>God of Fortune?</span></i><span style>“Give me the phone!”</span><span style>Ye Zichen received the phone Third Fatty Jin handed over and clicked open WeChat…</span><span style>It wasn’t in the Heavenly Court’s group.</span><span style>It was in the Red Packet Server he had created.</span><span style>God of Fortune: @Only Idealism!</span><span style>God of Fortune: @Only Idealism!</span><span style>God of Fortune: @Only Idealism!</span><span style>Canopy Marshal: God of Fortune, even if you ask Sky Sovereign, he wouldn’t lend it to you.</span><span style>Erlang Shen: Yeah, what’s more, you’re a rich person, why do you need to borrow from my bro?</span><span style>God of Fortune: You guys don’t get it. I used all my cultivation experience for directional investment, which is in its key moments now, so I can’t withdraw it.</span> <span style>Yue Lao: Come to me. 3% Interest!</span><span style>Ye Zichen was confused as he looked at the messages in the group. Why did the chat sound like the God of Fortune wanted to get a usurious loan?</span><i><span style>The God of Fortune getting a usurious loan!</span></i><i><span style>How’s that possible!</span></i><span style>No matter the times, there were always plenty of people worshipping the God of Fortune. It could be said that the God of Fortune was an evergreen tree in the Heavenly Court…</span><span style>What’s more, since he was the god in charge of wealth, he did not seem like someone that lacked money!</span><span style>“Cough, cough, God of Fortune came to my group as well. Have a look at the chat name. This is the Red Packet Server, you must give our red packets when you enter!”</span><span style>Canopy Marshal: Sky Sovereign, how is it going with you and Chang’e?</span><span style>Erlang Shen: Chang’e announced the relationship! Bro, amazing!</span><span style>Old Lord Taishang: Hmph!</span><i><span style>F*ck, when did Old Lord Taishang enter the group?</span></i><span style>“@Old Lord Taishang, don’t snort here. Send red packets when you enter the group!”</span><span style>Dingdong.</span><span style>At this moment, a large red packet appeared on the screen.</span><span style>Ye Zichen quickly clicked on it.</span><span style>You received the God of Fortune’s Red Packet.</span><span style>You gained the title: Flowing Profits x1.</span><span style>Flowing Profits (Title): Wearer’s fortune of wealth +1.</span><span style>It didn’t say anything useful, but +1 Fortune of Wealth is better than nothing.</span><span style>Withdraw.</span><span style>Do you want to equip the Flowing Profits (Title)?</span><span style>Yes.</span><span style>Dingdong.</span><span style>You have equipped Flowing Profits (Title).</span><span style>The moment the system notified Ye Zichen of the title being equipped, Ye Zichen subconsciously looked above him…</span><span style>It seems like it wasn’t like games where the title was shown above his head.</span><span style>Canopy Marshal: God of Fortune really is failing.</span><span style>Erlang Shen: Three gold ingots, God of Fortune is truly shameful!</span><span style>God of Fortune: @Only Idealism, Sky Sovereign, I have some matters that I would like to discuss with you.</span><span style>Not long later, the God of Fortune’s friend request was shown in Ye Zichen’s contact list. Ye Zichen immediately clicked accept without thinking.</span><span style>“Sky Sovereign.”</span><span style>God of Fortune’s profile pic looked rather similar to the pictures of the God of Fortune that would be stuck on the walls during Chinese New Year. He wore a large red robe, while gold ingots flew around him.</span><span style>Ye Zichen habitually looked at the intimacy level.</span><span style>200.</span><span style>Trusted.</span><span style>This was the first time Ye Zichen had seen a starting intimacy level be so high.</span><span style>“What business does the God of Fortune have with this sovereign?”</span><span style>“Sky Sovereign, I’m going to say it directly, I want to borrow some cultivation experience from you.”</span> <span style>God of Fortune borrowing cultivation experience. This would definitely cause a huge shock to the entirety of the Heavenly Court if others found out about it.</span><span style>Even Ye Zichen was stunned for a long time before he finally replied.</span><span style>“You said that you want to borrow cultivation experience from me?”</span><span style>“Yes,” Although it was a bit shameful for the God of Fortune to borrow cultivation experience from others, the God of Fortune continued to reply. “Recently, the Sky Sovereign’s business in our Heavenly Court is great. You definitely have quite a bit of cultivation experience on hand. If you aren’t using the cultivation experience, it is a waste for you to keep it lying around. You might as well entrust it to this little deity, and allow this little deity to help celestial sovereign to do some investments?”</span><span style>“…”</span><i><span style>Why did he sound like a bank clerk?</span></i><i><span style>But when I think about it, the God of Fortune is actually right, the cheapest secret scripture in the Treasure Shop cost a million cultivation experience.</span></i><span style>Recently, Xiao Yumei’s company had not yet gone on track, and even if she needed pills, several tens of thousands of cultivation experience was enough to support it.</span><i><span style>Then I’ll still have several hundred thousand cultivation experience on hand!</span></i><span style>“I can lend two hundred thousand cultivation experience to you, but I want to know what I can get.”</span><span style>Two hundred thousand!</span><span style>The God of Fortune, who gripped his phone frowned. He thought that the Sky Sovereign would start from at least a million.</span><span style>But due to the mindset that even something tiny was still something…</span> <span style>“Sky Sovereign, I can help you manage your finances and double your cultivation experience!”</span><i><span style>He is seriously bank clerk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes speechlessly, then smiled.</span><span style>“I don’t need my cultivation experience to be doubled.”</span><span style>“Then you…”</span><span style>“Cultivation experience isn’t that important to this sovereign, so it’s not impossible for me to gift this cultivation experience to you!”</span><span style>“Are you for real!” Then very quickly, the God of Fortune added. “What do I need to give up?”</span><span style>“Smart!”</span><span style>Ye Zichen snapped and smiled.</span><span style>“As the God of Fortune, you should be in charge of the fortune of mortal families, right?”</span><span style>“Naturally!” The God of Fortune nodded in certainty. “The prospering of mortal families all rely on a single one of my thoughts.”</span><span style>“Good!”</span><span style>Ye Zichen licked his lips and smiled.</span><span style>“Then I want you to help me deal with a mortal family. That is the capital’s Huo family, one of their children is Huo Da. I don’t know anything else. I want this family to fall!”</span></p>

 <p><strong>God of Fortune:&nbsp;</strong>Canopy Marshal, please lend me some cultivation experience.</p>
