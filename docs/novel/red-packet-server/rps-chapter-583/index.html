 <p><span style>“I, Old Sun, seem to have seen you before,” the Great Sage sat cross-legged on the ground and looked at the Fatty in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian also couldn’t help but blink, “Now that the monkey said so, I feel like I’ve seen you before as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m your grandfather, since I’ve seen him before, then of course you have too,” even though the Great Sage was healing on the ground, he still couldn’t help but verbally attack Yang Jian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since you’re injured, I’m not going to bother with you,” Yang Jian twitched his mouth, then squinted his eyes at the Fatty. “I seem to recall it being you who took us over to the Modern Realm when we led our armies, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm, now move aside since you’ve remembered,” Fatty lifted his hand and signaled the people in the surroundings to step back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When everyone retreated by approximately ten meters, they saw a huge go board[1.</span><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Go-board-animated.gif/220px-Go-board-animated.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style>https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Go-board-animated.gif/220px-Go-board-animated.gif</span></a><span style>], with the black and white pieces placed on very special spots.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eight Formation Origin Chart!” Wei Chen couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone else also opened their eyes wide when they heard it.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Eight Formation Origin Chart!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>That was a primordial divine artifact.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the Great War of Demons and Gods, the Lich Clan had sent out the descendant of the Twelve Great Liches[1. Take note that the “Lich” (巫族) mentioned here is not those skeletal mages you normally think about. They can look vastly different according to the novel they are from. However, the origin of the Twelve Great Liches (十二大巫/十二巫祖) is more or less constant. They are formed from the blood essence of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangu" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style>Pangu</span></a><span style>.] to bring the Eight Formation Origin Chart to the God Emperor of the time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The God Emperor was able to trap and kill millions of demons into the Eight Formation Origin Chart, which was what brought about their victory.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the Eight Formation Origin Chart disappeared after that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The God Race had once sent out their troops to search for it, but they had never found it anywhere. What’s more, there was never any news about it after that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only reason Wei Chen could mention it was because of his inheritance memories from one of the Four Sacred Beasts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is really the Eight Formation Origin Chart?” The dragon elder gulped. Zhuge Hong also raised her eyebrows in shock.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The divine artifact that caused the entire Demon Realm to tremble in terror actually appeared here.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Shut up,” Fatty scolded. Although everyone else were people were of high status, none of them even revealed a look of impatience.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They merely looked at the formation overhead silently as it glowed with a gold or blue color…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Fatty in front of the formation suddenly retreated after receiving an attack. He quickly found his footing once again, but the formation above his head gradually faded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is strange.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior…” Su Liu’er naturally knew that the Eight Formation Origin Chart represented as the clan head of the Fox Yaos. She disregarded her injuries, and forced herself up to kneel in front of the fatty, “Senior, please. I beg of you. Please save my little sister!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As her crystal-like tears dripped onto the ground, the fatty looked at her as suddenly recalled the image </span><i><span style>that person </span></i><span style>had shown him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are… Su Liu’er?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!” Su Liu’er looked up and nodded I confirmation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know about you. Did your little sister get captured by someone who requested Ye Zichen in exchange for her?” the fatty asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!” Su Liu’er nodded once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I came here due to someone’s request to get Ye Zichen out in order to save a… what was she called again? Su Yan? Ahh, I think that’s it. Is that your little sister?” the fatty asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!” Su Liu’er nodded once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right then. Stop kneeling here, I can’t accept it. I heard </span><i><span style>that person</span></i><span style> say that you’re my older sister-in-law in the future. I seem to have married that little sister of yours called Su Zhu.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk,” Su Zhu suddenly frowned. “Who’re you? I’ve never seen you before. Stop being so shameless. Marry me? I hate fatties.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re Su Zhu? That guy seriously didn’t trick me. You really are beautiful,” the fatty couldn’t help but nod, then rubbed his chin. “This isn’t my main body, it’s a body I exchanged for using points. My main body is beyond handsome and cool. You definitely won’t regret being with me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go and die!” Su Zhu scolded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ sis!” Su Liu’er frowned in anger. Then, after Su Zhu calmed down, she spoke up once more. “Senior, can we not talk about all this? My little sister…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That guy has said it already. It has to be Ye Zichen who goes to save her. That is something he must experience,” the fatty twisted his neck and replied. “But he gave me the Eight Formation Origin Chart when we were coming over and told me that it can open the seal. But when I tried just now, I felt like something was missing…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fatty, no need for you to do it now,” at that moment, an aged man appeared in the sky. What caught everybody’s attention was that there was the mark of a celestial sword on his right arm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn’t you say that it’s not good for you to reveal yourself?” the fatty asked</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Things started going out of my expectations. This is no longer what I’ve experienced,” the man in the air sighed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fatty quickly raised his eyebrows, “Then is she still my wife? I like her quite a bit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lil’ sis!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Liu’er dragged Su Zhu back, and looked up into the sky. Yet, no matter how hard she tried, there seemed to be a thin veil covering the man’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. You were madly in love back then, but… Never mind, let’s not talk about it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man slowly descended in front of the seal and tapped it…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Trying to resist?” the man laughed mockingly. “A puny artifact spirit is actually trying to be fierce in front of me? Shatter!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the word “shatter” came out of his mouth, it felt like it was absolute. It was as if the laws of the world were his to command.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the seals shattered like a broken mirror.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, the man walked in front of Su Liu’er and smiled, “Liu’er-jie, I will not allow Su Yan to leave Ye Zichen. Absolutely not!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, he turned back towards the woods, “The seals outside Mount Supreme have indeed been destroyed, but the interior seals of Mount Supreme is more than a hundred times stronger than this. Six Eared Macaque, I need your help!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, at the Niflheim Hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fortunately, everyone who survived the trials found the hall. Of course, that was only because Ye Zichen had brought them over together due to his kindness. Otherwise, unless they were insanely lucky, it was merely a dream for them to find the hall in a place as huge as Mount Supreme.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, there were indeed new players just like what Ye Zichen heard during the trials.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, all of them wore black robes, so he didn’t know who they were.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, a black-robed man suddenly appeared on the throne in the hall they were in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Allow me to introduce myself. I’m Duan Hai, then current master of Mount Supreme!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Duan Hai, you are truly daring,” Ye Zichen smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man on the throne nodded, “Why wouldn’t I dare? But let me tell you all now. Someone is forcingly breaking through Mount Supreme’s seals from the outside. So the way we play the game will have to speed up. I don’t want anyone to destroy this banquet of ours.”</span></p>

 <p></p>
 <p>Who's this fatty? Why do I feel like I've seen him somewhere before?</p>
 <p>Hmmm, I wonder when it was? Could it have been in the Immortal Region? No,&nbsp;that's not right.</p>
 <p>Then... the Heavenly Court? No way. As the head of security, I would remember seeing someone like him.</p>
 <p>I don't think it was around here in the Beast Region either...</p>
 <p>Just where...</p>
 <p>OOOH! I know! It's the Modern Realm! Yes! That's right,&nbsp;this is that fatty friend of Ye-zi's&nbsp;who I saw in the place where I smacked the shit out of a demon. Yes... That's the... What's the name of the family again?</p>
 <p>Wait,&nbsp;never mind that. That divine artifact the fatty is holding up...</p>
