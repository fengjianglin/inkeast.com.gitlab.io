 <p><span style>Chapter 305 – Su Yan’s Monologue</span></p>
 <p><span style>The soft words were picked up by Ye Zichen’s ear like poison. He stared at Xia Keke in shock, only to notice that her face had already turned bright red.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you looking at me like that for! It’s just to try it once, we can’t do it after we leave here since the dragon race has rules… This place is different from the outside, I’m just curious so I want to experience it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Try-Try what?” Ye Zichen licked his lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you think? Stop pretending to be an idiot. If you don’t want to, then whatever. This lady merely saw that… saw that you seem to be in pain.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke turned around to leave with a snort.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Ye Zichen raised his hand and grabbed hold of her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ya!” Xia Keke called out. Then, when she looked at Ye Zichen, who was laying on top of her with red eyes, she bit her lips. “Just this once, we can’t do it outside!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, she closed her eyes!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, within the hotel room…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Qihu had told Su Yan about Ye Zichen going to get a room. However, she did not believe him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In order to make his daughter accept the fact, Su Qihu took her to the hotel…</span></p>
 <p><span style>By using his military identity, he was able to make the hotel open the room. Yet, when he entered the room, he saw that both Ye Zichen and Xia Keke were clothed as they sat on two opposite sides of the sofa.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brat!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Qihu pushed Ye Zichen!</span></p>
 <p><span style>No reaction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Qihu was stunned. He could feel that Ye Zichen was not pretending to sleep since he was truly unable to feel Ye Zichen’s breath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, his phone buzzed. He answered the call briefly with a frown, then shouted towards Su Yan, “Let’s go back, and talk about the two of them when we’re got the time!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go back to work first, I’ll wait for them to wake up here,” Su Yan smiled. “I’m worried about the two of them like this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s already like this and you’re still thinking for the brat? He brought a woman to the hotel!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But they didn’t do anything? Even if he did do something, I’m still willing to stay by his side. I owe him at least that much!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What-What the heck are you saying!?” Su Qihu was instantly enraged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Su Yan merely shrugged with a smile, “He saved me when I was completely helpless and in danger, he saved grandpa when grandpa was on the verge of dying. He’s also helped older brother. I owe him way too much, and am unable to repay it… So I can only repay him with the rest of my life!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…” Su Qihu stuttered and was unable to say anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan chuckled, “Go back first, I’ve grown up. I can decide on my life.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ai!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did Su Qihu finally leave angrily. Yet, despite his anger, he still left two soldiers behind to ensure Su Yan’s safety.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the hotel room door closed, Su Yan, who sat between the two people touched Ye Zichen’s face and smiled, “You’re doing something strange right now once again, right? I really do think so.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Actually, I have already guessed some of your secrets, but I’ve been waiting for you to tell me. Yet, you still haven’t.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Perhaps, you feel like I’m not worthy of your trust in your heart? That’s probably the case. Actually, my favor for you is not pure either.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I actually am not mad for you having other women. I don’t think that I’m a particularly generous person. I thought about it for a long time after I realized, and in the end, I feel like… Perhaps I feel more curious and thankful towards you in comparison.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will keep being by your side to make myself fall in love with you. Even if you stop loving me in the end, had enough of my face and got sick of me, I will still stand behind you… From the very moment that you saved me from the mansion, I knew… that I would have to repay you using the remainder of this life.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her soft words revealed an indescribable feeling of helplessness. As she leaned silently on Ye Zichen’s shoulders, she suddenly felt his heart race.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Xia Keke’s face also turned a sickly red.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan was immediately worried. The first thing she did was dial the emergency number without any hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within the sea of consciousness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke held Ye Zichen’s shoulders tightly as she opened her mouth slightly and presented a look of satisfaction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe!” Ye Zichen caressed Xia Keke’s hair with a smile and teased. “Seriously, normal people really wouldn’t be able to handle you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk,” Xia Keke blushed, then glared at him. “I was just cooperating because I saw that you still wanted more.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then she pouted and pushed Ye Zichen away, “It isn’t addicting like they said at all. They’re all liars. Or, it might just be that you’re too useless, hehe…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, yeah,” Ye Zichen smiled meaningfully. “I wonder who had look of satisfaction just now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re still talking about it!?” Xia Keke raised her fists.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately gave up, “Alright, alright, I was wrong.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmph!” Xia Keke lifted her delicate chin, then stopped speaking. However, she still continued to think back to the feeling earlier…</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a long time…</span></p>
 <p><span style>When both of them had rested enough, Ye Zichen stood up and looked at the empty space.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I wonder when we can leave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you in such a hurry?” Xia Keke licked her lips and ran beside him. “How about it, let’s go at it one more time…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This woman…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Xia Keke instantly pouted when she saw Ye Zichen’s gaze and stuttered, “I-I was just worried that you’d want to. Never mind, even if you want, I’m not going to go along with you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she said that, the sea of consciousness begun to collapse. Then not long later, both of them exited from the sea of consciousness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen opened his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And saw completely white scene.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sat up in the hospital bed, and noticed that he actually was laying in the hospital. Meanwhile, Xia Keke also had a look of confusion on her face on the hospital bed beside him…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How did we end up in the hospital?” Xia Keke asked in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How would I know?” Ye Zichen did not understand either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment, the door to the ward was pushed open. Su Yan walked in with a flushed face. She had just returned from the doctor who told her about their situation…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The doctor had a very strange expression when he told her as well. Under normal circumstances, what happened to them was impossible. Yet, it did happen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Susu!” Xia Keke blinked her large eyes. “Why are you here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I brought the two of you here,” Su Yan bit her lips in response. “I was in the hotel when I saw the two of you… Mm, basically, it was very strange. Since I was worried that something was wrong with you two, I dialed the emergency number.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen and Xia Keke both blushed…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Strange.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>She should be talking about when the two of us… were doing that!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I am kind of curious,” Su Yan suddenly bit her lips. “Back then… what were the two of you doing?”</span></p>
