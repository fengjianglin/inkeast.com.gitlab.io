 <p><span style>Chapter 733 – Jade Emperor Arrives</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>“We haven’t had so many guests in ages, so please forgive me for the terrible hospitality,” the Third Princess of the West Sea <a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> brought a few dishes over.</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>All the deities chuckled, “Little sister, don’t bother, we’re no outsiders.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>These deities might not have spoken with such familiarity a few years before, but Ye Zichen’s appearance had turned these acquainted deities into a small group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Third Princess left with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Yang Jian held up a cup of divine liquor…</span></p>
 <p><span style>No.</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>It was just Er Guo Tou<a id="footnoteref-2" href="#footnote-2">[2]</a></span></span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, it’s rare for you to come to the Heavenly Court, so let’s drink to you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“True Lord is right. Although Sky Sovereign often chats with us in the group, he rarely comes to the Heavenly Court. It’s hard for us to descend as well, so we must drink!” All the deities raised their cups, while Flame Emperor looked at Ye Zichen in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just what did my old friend go through during his reincarnated lives? How is he so familiar with all these Heavenly Court deities?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Although he was confused, he still held up his cup like the others to prevent himself from ruining the mood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then, let’s drink?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen chugged down the cup instantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Time seemed to fly by.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In what seemed like mere moments, the deities drank everything from red wine and beer to all sorts of liquor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Anybody in the Modern Realm would have been dead drunk from all the drinking. However, these were deities, who showed no signs of drunkenness even after downing everything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Simple chitchat always came to an end, but that doesn’t mark the end of a conversation with drinks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, the topic naturally drifted towards the Jade Emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Honestly, it really is strange. We haven’t seen the Jade Emperor recently,” God of Thunder muttered as he took another sip of liquor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though they could make their own decisions regarding the Heavenly Court’s defenses as generals under the Jade Emperor’s banner, they would often just relay the Jade Emperor’s decisions to their soldiers instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, they had not seen the Jade Emperor in the past few days, so they could only come up with their own ideas about what to do.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Lord, do you have any insider information about this?” Yue Lao squinted his eyes with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I really don’t,” Old Lord Taishang stretched lazily. “That brat didn’t come and find me the last few days.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t even know as one of the Three Pure Ones?” Yang Jian gasped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, you’re family, yet you don’t know anything either,” Old Lord Taishang retorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For some reason, the atmosphere around the table shifted. All the deities looked down at their cups and started to ponder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It really was strange that the Jade Emperor did not show himself for half a month.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although he has always been indulging in his own entertainment for a long time, he had never once missed morning court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They could make the decisions for the short term… But, sooner or later, there will be issues that they would have no right to decide upon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hah…” Ye Zichen smirked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other deities looked at him with raised eyebrows, “Sky Sovereign, why are you smirking?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm? Was I?” Ye Zichen looked at them in confusion. He merely imagined what the Jade Emperor’s expression must be right now, he didn’t expect himself to laugh out loud.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He didn’t?” The deities responded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shook his head, “Alright, fine, I did smirk. But aren’t you guys too restricting? Am I not allowed to do that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The deities laughed. This wisecrack also seemed to put an end to the topic of the Jade Emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After drinking together for a whole six hours, some of the deities started to play Landlord.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, the others stood behind them and laughed as they watched the matches.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment, a cloud floated across the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both Yang Jian and Old Lord Taishang were losing by a huge chunk, so they did not pay attention to the passing cloud at all. On the other hand, Ye Zichen smiled, but continued to play as if he didn’t know what was about to happen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Joker Bomb[3. This refers to a play of a pair of Jokers in Landlord, that can be played any time and is the ‘strongest’ combination of cards in the game!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian chucked out the Joker bomb without thinking when he saw Ye Zichen had nearly run out of cards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The deities watching the match all shook their heads. </span><i><span style>He definitely lost.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahem.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A soft cough sounded out behind the crowd. Yet, all of the deities ignored it and continued watching the match.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahem. Ahem.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen and the deities were not actually playing for money. The stakes were sticking slips onto each other’s faces. Yang Jian’s face was nearly filled up with them, so he was extremely frustrated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, the coughing instantly ticked him off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who the f*ck was that? If you have a cold, then go and take your meds. Stop your mother*cking cough.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The rest of the deities turned around…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gulp.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Isn’t this the Jade Emperor!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Greetings, Your Majesty!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The various deities quickly greeted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Jade Emperor already had a poor expression on his face, which only turned even darker when he heard Yang Jian’s words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The soft nod caused the deities to freeze. </span><i><span style>Our boss is definitely angry.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian, who was just about to play a card shuddered, then froze with the cards in his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A while later, he finally glanced behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He turned around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bent down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lowered his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And cupped his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Greetings, Your Majesty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hah…” The Jade Emperor let out a soft laugh, then forced a smile at Yang Jian, who did not dare to meet his gaze. “True Lord, thank you for your concern. I seems like this one really should go and take some cold medicine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That is merely this subordinate’s responsibility.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jade Emperor face turned nearly completely black when he heard Yang Jian dare to reply. </span><i><span style>Is he being an idiot, or is he insulting me?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The Jade Emperor took a deep breath, then focused himself on his target.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He ignored Yang Jian, then glared at Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jade Emperor would like to play a few rounds as well?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm, present.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen shuffled the poker cards and smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop playing dumb, you should know why I have come here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can’t resist anymore? I thought you would be able to endure it for at least another half month,” Ye Zichen chucked the cards onto the table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The deities were completely confused. </span><i><span style>What are they talking about? It sounds so mysterious!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Do not mess around with me. I have no time to waste with you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jade Emperor released a powerful spiritual pressure that stunned all the deities.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had been years since they have seen the Jade Emperor act so forcefully. In the past ten thousand years, the Jade Emperor has always acted the part of a foolish ruler.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The passage of time even made them forget that the Jade Emperor was once the strongest in the Three Realms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In a hurry?” Ye Zichen smiled, then turned towards the doorway. “You should come out as well. Aren’t the two of you working together? Why are you still hiding?”</span></p>
