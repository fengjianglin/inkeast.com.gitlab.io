 <p><span style>Chapter 721 – The Vanished Ley Line</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s the ley line!” Great Emperor Qingming couldn’t hide the surprise in his eyes as he was bathed in the holy light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When it came to experience, he was definitely one of the newer members in the Immortal Region’s higher-ups. He was not alive during the era where the ley line was exposed to the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he felt himself fill up with spiritual energy…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He suddenly felt like most of his life was all for nothing.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I managed to reach the level of half-a-step into the Immortal King level. I’m sure it is only a matter of time before I completely break through.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone from the Immortal Region could feel the effects of the ley line…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s so powerful,” That was the only complete sentence he could mutter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The truth was that, even he had a split second where he wanted to take the ley line for himself. However, he discarded it as quickly as it appeared, while his body greedily absorbed the pure spiritual energy in his surroundings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two hours then passed by in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In his perspective, he merely shut his eyes for a split second.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>No, I can’t let this continue. I can’t forget my purpose for being here just for my selfish needs.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He forcefully cast his greedy thoughts aside and turned to the Flame Emperor, “Big Brother Flame Emperor?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you get your fill?” Flame Emperor smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Great Emperor Qingming blushed. He understood just how unsightly he was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t be embarrassed. You never experienced that era, so it’s understandable for you to react that way. Your self-restraint is truly stronger than I expected. I thought you would enjoy it for a while longer,” Flame Emperor said in a comforting manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Flame Emperor, please don’t tease me,” Great Emperor Qingming shook his head with a smile. “What should we do about the ley line?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was one question Flame Emperor did not have the answer to.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As one of the oldest members of the Immortal Region who has experienced the era of the ley line, he naturally reacted far better than Great Emperor Qingming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he had also lost himself for a split second the moment the ley line appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he dispelled the influence on him, he began to consider how he should deal with it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he did not arrive at a solution yet. He even started to wonder how the Yellow Emperor actually made the ley line hide obediently for several tens of thousands of years.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not sure,” Flame Emperor shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, at that very moment, the figure of the gold dragon roared in an irritated manner, sending raging waves of spiritual energy fluctuation out from its body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That lasted for a good fifteen minutes. Both Flame Emperor and Great Emperor Qingming stepped back. They were very surprised to find themselves unable to resist the rage of the ley line.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on?” Great Emperor Qingming asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve never experienced something like this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You haven’t either?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm,” Flame Emperor smiled wryly. </span><i><span style>He must be looking down on me. But I can’t do anything about it. The Yellow Emperor was the one who had the most contact with the ley line. He might know what is going on.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As the ley line continued to rampage, the pair stayed where they were and watched the ley line.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The rampaging ley line vanished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both Flame Emperor and Great Emperor Qingming were shocked when they saw that. They immediately searched using their spiritual consciousness, but still could not locate it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What worried them even more was that the enhancement coming the ley line disappeared as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If the ley line had merely moved, then its enhancements on the spiritual energy in the Three Realms would still persist, but would only change depending on the distance between the location and the ley line.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the Flame Emperor and Great Emperor Qingming could clearly feel that it completely disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was like…</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the Yellow Emperor hid the ley line.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even those in the Heavenly Court and the Underworld felt that as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The comfortable sensation of dense spiritual energy disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened?” Many people, who were sitting down, stood up and asked their friends and comrades. However, what they saw were only identical expressions to what they had on their faces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Some people merely smiled at who didn’t take it seriously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While some others started to curse. Regardless, it was clear that all of the Three Realms felt the disappearance of the ley line.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Flame Emperor, we…” Great Emperor was frantic. The ley line was of utmost importance, but they just </span><i><span style>lost </span></i><span style>it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Flame Emperor was feeling frantic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry, find Ye Zichen. He definitely knows what happened!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only the Yellow Emperor would understand what was going on!</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As expected of the demon marshal. You are very resilient to a beating.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen punched Black Dragon’s face once again, knocking his enemy to the ground and creating a huge crater.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Dragon had stopped attacking. It wasn’t because he didn’t want to. Rather, it was because he didn’t have enough spiritual energy to do so.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All he could do was defend with all his might and wait for a chance to escape.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?” At that moment, Ye Zichen frowned in the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Fatty Yin flew over, “You felt it too?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You as well?” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows. It was a strange feeling as if the “spiritual energy recovery buff” on him was gone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, two figures shot through the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen turned around and saw Flame Emperor and Great Emperor Qingming hurrying over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you here? Didn’t I tell you guys to find the ley line?” As he noticed their expressions, then linked it with what he felt… “You…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Flame Emperor whispered a few words in his ear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was shocked, “What!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t know what’s going on either?” Flame Emperor frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How would I!?” Ye Zichen shrugged with a wry smile. “I swear to the heavens that I’ve never encountered something like this before!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ley line had rampaged!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then disappeared!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen frantically searched through all his past memories, but could not find anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Flame Emperor’s face dropped. </span><i><span style>Ye Zichen doesn’t know what’s going on!?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Did the ley line just disappear!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Fatty Yin’s expression also grew sullen…</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the heat of their frantic discussions… they all forgot about Black Dragon, who had been waiting for such an opportunity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go!” Black Dragon shouted towards his subordinates.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The various demons immediately freed themselves from their restraints and charged out of the valley behind Black Dragon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, the bad guys are running away!” Lorie shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She wanted to stop them…</span></p>
 <p><span style>But there were too many of them...</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Original Chapter Teaser:</strong></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><b>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</b>Hey, why don't you keep running?</p>
 <p><strong>Black Dragon:&nbsp;</strong>You...</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>What about me? Why are you stuttering now? Cat got your tongue?</p>
 <p><strong>Black Dragon:&nbsp;</strong>I am the Marshal of the Demons!</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>I know that, but you're also my prisoner right now, so act like it. I can kill you and end everything, so tell me, why shouldn't I?</p>
 <p><strong>Black Dragon:&nbsp;</strong>I....</p>
 <p><strong>Ye Zichen:&nbsp;</strong>You.. You... You... It's all because of you demons! It's all because of you that I am here! It's because of you that the Modern Realm was ruined, my life was ruined! It's because of you that the Modern Realm is now frozen until somebody somewhere finds a way to fix everything! It's all on you!</p>
