 <p><span style>Chapter 647 – Damn Rules</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s getting late. I’ve stayed a bit too long in the lower realm. Since I couldn’t experience the life of a daoist apprentice, then I’ll be heading on back,” Cui Twelve said with a smile, then glanced towards the distance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re going back just like that? Since you were going to be an outer sect disciple here, then it doesn’t matter all that much. You might as well stay a while longer. I also have plenty of things I would like to enquire about,” Ye Zichen, who was in deep thought, tried to convince Cui Twelve to stay. Ye Zichen still had countless questions he wanted to ask.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cui Twelve was clearly a very good person to ask those questions to, but if he was to return so early…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nah, I don’t like staying here and being watched over. It really annoys me,” with that, Cui Twelve glanced towards an empty space not too far away with a meaningful smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He stretched lazily, then carefully put away the little bit of remaining liquor and patted Ye Zichen’s shoulder. “Be careful in the Immortal Region.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Cui Twelve put a spiritual compass on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A ray of light shot up from the compass and into the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cui Twelve stepped onto the compass and waved towards Ye Zichen with a smile, “See you in the God Realm, if it is to be.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Cui Twelve’s figure blurred and then disappeared from the plains, Ye Zichen continued to look at where Cui Twelve had departed from. While he felt kind of disappointed due to Cui Twelve’s departure, he couldn’t help but worry about Liu Qing’s situation in the God Realm once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a long while, a flock of wild geese flew across the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For some reason, Ye Zichen felt rather lonely as he watched the flock in the sky. He was foreign to the Immortal Region, and there was no one around he could talk to.</span></p>
 <p><span style>More importantly, it was getting dark, yet he didn’t even have a place to stay.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Considering that there weren’t any inns around here that he could stay at, Ye Zichen made up his mind to camp outside. He sat indifferently on the ground as he stuffed the remaining bits of the roasted chicken into his mouth, then called out to the system.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“System, come out here. I know you’re watching me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: An issue came up just now, but don’t worry, someone will come to find you soon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The issue the system was referring to was clearly how nobody seemed to care when Ye Zichen had arrived.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but grit his teeth and rolled his eyes as he held his phone tightly, “You put that simply. You know? I went to Yonghe Temple and mentioned that I’m the reincarnation of the Yellow Emperor, yet they completely ignored me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: Yonghe Temple?</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: Why did you go over there? Yonghe Temple is actually asilfhsdilfiusahdifnsdjghsidfhbaslkdfhsajfhjk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately started to wonder what the scrambled things at the end of the sentence were, but in the end, he could only give up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What the hell?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: Damn Rules.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was clear that the system’s message was censored by something. It was a very rare situation, and something that Ye Zichen can’t seem to recall </span><i><span style>ever </span></i><span style>happening.</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: Just stop coming into contact with the guys from Yonghe. Find a place to stay these next few days. Someone will come and pick you up soon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What about the people from Yonghe?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen frowned. The censored words, the “damn” and now forbidding him to come into contact with the people from Yonghe…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: Just don’t worry about it. Also, don’t take Xuan-Yuan Sword out of the Treasure Chest before the Flame Emperor and the rest arrive, got it?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood,” Ye Zichen nodded affirmatively.</span></p>
 <p><span style>System Notification: Then that’s that. I’m rather busy as well, so let’s stop here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, the system’s notifications gradually disappeared from the screen, which represented that the system really had stopped talking to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen recalled the conversation earlier with a dark look.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>There’s definitely something iffy about Yonghe.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t know what it was, but he knew that he had to be more careful in the future.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen put the issue of Yonghe behind him, then suddenly remembered Taibai Jinxing. That was a man who definitely had a good idea of the God Realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After all, he stayed there for quite some time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clicked on his chat with Taibai Jinxing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Geezer Taibai!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He sent out the message, but only to see it remain in the “sending” status. After a while, a red exclamation mark appeared next to it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sending failed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen scratched his head and tried again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It failed again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is strange.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen took a look at his phone’s signal bar. It clearly showed that he had service. He even refreshed his Moments just to double check.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>No problem.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s that geezer doing?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen scratched his head and put his phone away, then laid down onto the plains to look up at the clear moon.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Damn it, it’s a full moon.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Whenever people that are away from home look at a full moon, they can’t help but think about their hometown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I really wonder when I can return to the Modern Realm or not.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before Ye Zichen went to sleep, he set up a tent-like barrier around him. Although he was camping in the wild, he could see himself enjoying the sleep.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, the night passed…</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Notification sounds rang out repeatedly from Ye Zichen’s phone, causing him to take it out sluggishly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His screen was filled with messages from Yang Jian, while there were several other unread messages.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked up into the sky and saw that the sun was alright bright above his head. He patted his face, then opened the chat with Yang Jian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That word filled the screen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen yawned, then replied the message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re finally here,” Yang Jian replied instantly. “What are you planning to do about the incident in the Underworld?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Underworld incident?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen scratched his head in confusion. He had slept through the night. </span><i><span style>What in the world happened with the Underworld?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you not check the group yet? Whatever, I’ll tell you. There’s an internal mess in the Underworld. The chiefs of all eighteen floors of hell randomly disappeared. The seals in the Underworld were all undone and the wraiths have all come out. The Underworld is in a complete mess now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was shocked. He replied with a frown, “Are you sure?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The entire Heavenly Court knows about this. Do you think that’ll be fake? If you don’t believe me, then look at the chat, they’re still discussing it right now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you want me to do about it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Although the Underworld and the Heavenly Court haven’t been on the best terms, we were one entity before. You are the Chancellor of the Grand Secretariat right now, you have the right to decide whether we’re going to send out our armies out to help. I feel like this is the best chance to begin repairing our relationship with the Underworld. Bro, what do you think?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the Underworld and the Heavenly Court had a rather tense relationship until recently, the older generations of deities like Yang Jian still cared about their past bonds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, the moment this situation occurred, they all sought out Ye Zichen…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s a pretty good idea, but… let me understand what’s going on first.”</span></p>
 <p></p>

 <p>In the Underworld...</p>
 <p><b>Great Sacred Emperor Equaling Heaven:&nbsp;</b>Damn it!</p>
 <p><strong>Ox-Head:&nbsp;</strong>Your Majesty...</p>
 <p><b>Great Sacred Emperor Equaling Heaven:&nbsp;</b>I lost him!</p>
 <p><strong>Xie Bian:&nbsp;</strong>Your Majesty, even you did not manage to find him?</p>
 <p><b>Great Sacred Emperor Equaling Heaven:&nbsp;</b>No, he was too crafty, and was clearly prepared. I followed traces, but&nbsp;they led to nothing. The only thing I can be sure of is that... demons are behind this.</p>
 <p><strong>Xie Bian:&nbsp;</strong>What do we do now?</p>
 <p><strong><b>Great Sacred Emperor Equaling Heaven:&nbsp;</b></strong>Mobilize our armies. We need to suppress the wraiths as fast as possible. Also... try and ask the Heavenly Court for help. Now is not the time to care about our petty squabbles. Understood?</p>
