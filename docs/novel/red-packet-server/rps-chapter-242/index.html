 <p><span style>Chapter 242 – Xie Lei’s Display of Humility</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If there’s stuff to talk about, then let’s talk about it. If you want to try and take my lollipop… No way!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gou Yuzhan guarded the lollipop in his hand fiercely, while he did not give up on the one in his mouth either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Ye Zichen couldn’t help but smile helplessly, “Did you forget who gave you that lollipop?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Gou Yuzhan blinked, then pushed his glasses up…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you don’t want the lollipops, then anything can be negotiated.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I just want to ask you a few questions, if you answer properly, then not only would I not take your lollipop, I would…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zoom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen picked up the entire box of lollipops from the cashier counter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gulp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Too dazzling!” Gou Yuzhan continuously licked his lips. He wanted to move his gaze away, but his head just refused to budge. “Ask away!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can see the ghost girl beside me? Also, where did you get your cross from?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can’t see her, but I can feel her,” Gou Yuzhan licked his lollipop and answered blurrily. “As for the cross, my family has rules that I can’t tell others…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen immediately held out the box of lollipops in front of him…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Too dazzling!” Gou Yuzhan gulped fiercely as he clenched his fist tightly and revealed a struggling expression on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, he still lost to the dazzle of lollipops!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That cross is a magical item that I refined.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pa.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen chucked a lollipop over. Gou Yuzhan accurately caught it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You really are giving it to me!” Gou Yuzhan was stunned. Then, he instantly discarded all of his morals and rules that he was supposed to follow. “Shopkeeper, do you need a magical item? I can sell it to you, it’ll only cost one lollipop!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t need any magical items. You mentioned your family just now… What does your family do? Are they from the capital?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, my family’s from Bingcheng, my dad opened a Daoist Temple…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen chucked another lollipop over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, Ye Zichen asked and he answered. When Ye Zichen pretty much finished with his questions, all of the lollipops were more or less given away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Gou Yuzhan had a huge smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir, do you have any more questions?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A lollipop for the answer to a question, this wasn’t a fortunate thing that one could find every day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nope, you can leave now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir, you truly are a great person!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Gou Yuzhan left the supermarket in satisfaction as he took a pile of lollipops with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Liu Qing, how are you?” Ye Zichen asked towards the dragon eye after sending Gou Yuzhan off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dragon eye simmered, and Liu Qing flew out from within. </span><i><span style>From the looks of her, she seems to have completely recovered.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m fine, the silver cross just now was so weird…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That is a magic item that is specifically used to fight ghosts. That brat is actually a young daoist,” Ye Zichen smiled. However, at the same time, he was speechless…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>His family can open up a daoist temple, but why did he feel so poor?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“That little daoist isn’t simple.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen decided and made up his mind that he must have a good chat with Gou Yuzhan the next time they meet. As for whether the latter will tell him the truth? Ye Zichen wasn’t worried at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He already knew Gou Yuzhan’s weakness. No matter what, he was someone that understood weaknesses are meant to be used.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s phone on the table rang. He took a look at the messages.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Lei: You there?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This brat has recently come to find me very frequently!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it now? Don’t tell me you broke the Transformer again. This time, I don’t have anything I want to exchange for.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No!” Xie Lei scratched his head, and revealed a troubled expression. “It’s my grandpa’s birthday in a few days, I want to give him a birthday present.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s Xie Bian’s birthday?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You actually dare to use my grandpa’s full name?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but roll his eyes in disdain when he saw Xie Lei’s message.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I know my identity now. I’m the Yellow Emperor of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors of the ancients times and one of the big shots of the Rogue Immortals. So what if I called Xie Bian directly by his name?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s just that I’m rather weak now, otherwise…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Full name or what? What are you coming to me about Xie Bian’s birthday for? That is an issue for you descendants.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is this person an idiot!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Lei, who sat on a stone chair in his back garden frowned. Bu Er sat on his side as he tried to put a puzzle together on the table…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bu Er, say, do you think this person is playing dumb with me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bu Er doesn’t know,” Bu Er tiled his head in a moe manner. “Bu Er has never been human before, so doesn’t know their thoughts.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Never mind, just keep playing with the puzzle!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh!” Bu Er started to concentrate on the puzzle once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>XIe Lei licked his lips and looked at the news on the screen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Bro, just stop messing with little brother. Little brother wants to get some treasures from the mortal realm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who was smoking within the supermarket, was stunned by Xie Lei’s message.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Big Bro!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>This brat could actually lower himself down so much?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Xie Lei sent another message over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Truth be told, although little brother is the Ghost Marshal’s descendent, there is a huge competition within the family. I’m one of those who are not very welcome. That is something you can tell from my residence. The others in the family all usually live in the Ghost Capital, but I am living in the rural areas of the Ghost Region that overlaps with the Mortal Realm.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Seriously…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>There is competition within the family when people are alive, but it was no different when dead.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen sighed when he said the pitiful message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How about I send you two rows of cigarettes?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cigarettes? My grandpa doesn’t seem to like that sort of thing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Doesn’t like them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cigarettes are things that sold very well in the male deity community. Even King Qinguang of the Underworld awarded White Impermanence with a lot of treasures because she gave him a row of cigarettes.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Xie Bian actually didn’t like this sort of thing!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“My grandpa likes tea from the Mortal Realm!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This Ghost Marshal understands the need to keep himself in good health!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen walked around the supermarket, and remembered that he seemed to have ordered some jasmine tea that sold for two yuan per packet a while ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a while, Ye ZIchen managed to find the crushed jasmine tea with the help of the Fiery Eyes of Truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Scan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Send.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Level 1 Ghost Messenger Xie Lei received your red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Lei looked at the packet of tea in his hands with his eyes wide open.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Ye Zichen also replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t have great tea leaves here, so I’ll give this to you first. I’ll send you better ones if I find some.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your intimacy level with Level 1 Ghost Messenger Xie Lei increased by 100. Current intimacy level: 200.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Intimacy level leveled up. Current intimacy level: 200.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Bro, thank you so much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In recent years, Xie Lei had always been shunned by the younger generation in the family, while Xie Bian had been busy at work, so he didn’t have time to worry about the competition between the youngsters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only day that Xie Lei could shine was on Xie Bian’s birthday feast.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With this packet of tea, he had a chance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When that happens…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, if you need little brother to do anything, then little brother will definitely help you do it if little brother is capable of that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Ye Zichen saw this message, he squinted his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you sure?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m sure!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then how about adding me to the Underworld’s group chat?”</span></p>
 <p></p>

 <p><em>In the mind of a certain young man who loves lollipops:</em></p>
 <p>Huh? No way, this guy can't be thinking of taking my lollipops, right?</p>
 <p>Hmmph, there's no way I'm going to hand my lollipops over to this evil shop keeper.</p>
 <p>Wait, hmm? What did he just say? He said that he doesn't want my lollipop? In that case, we can have a chat.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Oh my! Not only does he not want my lollipops, he's actually offering me so much more! All I need to do in exchange is answer some questions for him...</p>
 <p>Hmmm, lollipops vs. secrets. Hmmm....</p>
 <p>No... I must not give in, I must... So dazzling! Such a blinding sight! All hail lollipops!</p>
