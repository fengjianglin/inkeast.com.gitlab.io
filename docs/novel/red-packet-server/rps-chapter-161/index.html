 <p><span style>Han Xiangzi also sent a message when Immortal Lady He added Ye Zichen as a friend.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We just talked about everything with Immortal Lady He and told her to send you a friend request.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thanks.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regardless of what disagreements they had each other previously, adding Immortal Lady He as a contact was the most important part.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen swiftly accepted Immortal Lady He’s friend request.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before he even said anything, the other side sent him a red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You received Immortal Lady He’s red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Celestial-level Nine Heart Lotus Roots x1</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ba-thump.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s heart beat rapidly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He got it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Celestial-level Nine Heart Lotus Roots: Cultivated carefully by Immortal Lady He. A necessary item to form a celestial body.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Damn.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen could feel the amazing value of the item just from its description.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you, Immortal Lady He.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Celestial sovereign is too courteous. I still wish you could just ignore the times when Han Xiangzi had offended you before.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did Ye Zichen see Immortal Lady He’s profile image, where she held a huge lotus leaf and stood on top of a green lotus flower.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She displayed a traditional beauty, and it was undeniable that Immortal Lady He was indeed very pretty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No worries.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was in a very good mood after getting the Nine Heart Lotus Roots.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Xiangzi also sent a message over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Celestial sovereign, you received the Nine Heart Lotus Roots, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yep. Brother Han, thank you for your help.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen replied courteously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Han Xiangzi, who was in the Eight Immortal Mansion, read this message, he sighed.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What a great deity, it was all his fault that he was too impulsive earlier, making the other person unhappy.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Celestial sovereign, I was truly reckless just now. Please don’t take offense.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s no big deal, Brother Han’s feelings towards Immortal Lady He are truly rare. It was my mistake before as well. It is hard for others not to misunderstand since I asked Yue Lao to go and find Immortal Lady He.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ai.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Xiangzi sighed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing this message, Ye Zichen couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why is Brother Han sighing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Celestial sovereign might not know,” Han Xiangzi shook his head. “All deities know about my feelings towards Immortal Lady He. Before we became immortal, I had always been pursuing her. However, in order to become immortals, Immortal Lady and I discarded our emotions and desires. However, my feelings for her ran too deep. Yet Immortal Lady He’s immortal heart did not waver, but I…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Xiangzi did not finish, but Ye Zichen could feel that even after becoming immortal, he still could not face Immortal Lady He normally.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had feelings for her, but she did not return them…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Everyone understood the feelings of a secret crush.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It was sad.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was definitely the kind of person that liked to see people with feelings for each end up together. He felt rather bad for him when he saw how pitiful Han Xiangzi was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Han, have you expressed your feelings towards Immortal Lady He after becoming immortal?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How would that be possible?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Xiangzi shook his head with a sigh. Ever since they turned immortal, Immortal Lady He’s immortal heart had never wavered…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was also afraid that if he suddenly spoke out his feelings, not only would he get rejected, but they might not even be able to remain friends. Then that would be terrible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s no good, if you like her, then you have to fight for her. Don’t you understand?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You like Immortal Lady He and the thing you want most is to become a couple with her. Are you willing to always just be friends?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what can I do!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Confess,” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes. “If you like her, then confess, worst come to worst, you won’t be able to even be friends, but at least you’ve tried. If you continue to hold it in, who knows what you’re thinking, perhaps Immortal Lady He might just be waiting for you to speak to her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Xiangzi, who was in the Eight Immortal Manor, was moved when he saw this message.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To be honest, he truly suffered too much these several thousand years. Instead of continuing his secretly crushing on her and suffering, he might as well make everything clear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I’ll go to confess now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait!” Ye Zichen quickly stopped him. “Just going like that is no good, you’ve got to have support.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What should I do?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So f*cking stupid.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Then let me teach him how to chat up a girl!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen rolled his eyes speechlessly, then frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait a moment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment he sent the message, Ye Zichen kicked Third Fatty Jin, who was sitting on the sofa and looking at the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big bro.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go to the department store outside and buy some fireworks and red wine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fireworks? Red wine?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, hurry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Fatty Jin nodded, then ran out after taking several thousand yuan from Ye Zichen. At the same time, Ye Zichen also dialed a number to the florist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hello, I’m at XXXX. I want to order 999 roses.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The best scene for chatting up a girl…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Flowers, red wine and fireworks!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen had wanted to do something like a candlelight dinner, but he was worried that Han Xiangzi’s comprehension ability was limited, so he couldn’t make it so high class for his first time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, since the three most important items were there, he shouldn’t have too much of an issue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Approximately an hour later, flowers covered the room, while Third Fatty Jin returned with six sets of fireworks and two bottles of red wine.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, what treasures are these?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Great Sage skipped over in excitement, but Ye Zichen quickly stopped him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This monkey wanted to take a bite out of anything that he saw, if he treated the fireworks as snacks and takes a bite…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Then they’ll just light him up when lighting up the fireworks. His mouth was rather like a fireworks rocket.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Stuff kept on shooting out.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, Ye Zichen only thought that he could not put the Great Sage into danger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This isn’t food, go back and sit on the couch.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Petty,” The Great Sage muttered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen pretended like he didn’t hear it, then used his phone to scan and send all of the flowers, red wine and fireworks in the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Alongside all that, he also gifted Han Xiangzi a lighter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Xiangzi received your red packet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Celestial sovereign, what are these?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“These are great stuff. They are necessary items to chat up girls. It increases the success rate by fifty percent.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immediately after that, Ye Zichen explained how to use all of the items to Han Xiangzi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Celestial sovereign, I don’t know how I could begin to thank you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Xiangzi also imagined the romantic scene in his mind. He could even imagine the scene of success after he confesses to Immortal Lady He.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t be so happy this early. Thank me after it was of use.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, I, Han Xiangzi, will remember celestial sovereign’s favor for life.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your intimacy level with Han Xiangzi increased by 100. Current intimacy level: 200.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Intimacy level increased.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Current level: Trusted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen used around ten thousand yuan of investment to gain Han Xiangzi’s intimacy of Trusted in exchange. However, for some reason, he felt like he lost a little.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Han Xiangzi was just a flute player when he turned into an immortal back then. However, his shifu, Lü Dongbin, was rather fierce…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen didn’t know what benefits he could get from Han Xiangzi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen opened the chat group and read the message history. The moment he entered, he saw the God of Fortune saying that he would send money.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He hasn’t snatched a red packet in the group for a long time. Although the God of Fortune’s red packet was money…</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, one ingot was ten thousand yuan!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen concentrated fully in preparation of snatching red packets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dongdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A huge red packet appeared on the screen. Just as Ye Zichen raised his hand to click on it…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Buzz…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Damnit!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A call came through.</span></p>
