 <p><span style>Chapter 569 – Entering the Mountain</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually Ye Zichen had wanted to ask the question already. They had stayed there for quite a while already, but nobody mentioned anything about opening the gate. However, since he didn’t understand, he merely stay quiet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How are we supposed to open it when we don’t have all the keys?” Jail King twitched his mouth. “When all twelve keys appear in front of the gate, it’ll let out a red light, then the gate will open automatically.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see,” the female Yao Emperor nodded, not feeling ashamed for her ignorance at all. Normally speaking, people of their level cared a lot about their face, but her reaction merely showed that the Yao Emperors had a decent personality.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I wonder who’s so slow,” Bian Tianrui muttered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, a white-robed man walked out of the woods with a spiritual monkey on his shoulders. “Everyone’s here, so are you all waiting for me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bai Hai!” Two voices called out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen and Bian Tianrui looked towards each other, and revealed mocking smiles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bian Tianrui immediately spoke up, “Brother Bai, we descended together, so we should get closer with each other.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But I’m not the same kind of person as you,” Bai Hai smiled, then walked in front of Ye Zichen and raised his eyebrows. “Brother Liangchen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Liangchen!?” Bian Tianrui mocked. “Bai Hai, you don’t even know his real name right? He’s not called Liangchen. He’s called Ye Zichen!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm?” The three Yao Emperors all looked towards Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ye Zichen!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>They clearly remember what the sire told them. </span><i><span style>Either kill him or befriend him.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Big bro, don’t act recklessly. We have no qualms with each other right now. At the very least, we got off to a good start. Sire said that we can befriend him, so let’s not do anything to him unless we absolutely have to,” the female yao emperor pulled on the muscular man’s arm and shook her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man nodded, but maintained his gaze on Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Zichen, so I did make you rather wary that day,” Bai Hai smiled, and completely disregarded what Bian Tianrui said. “But it looks like I’m not the last one. Someone’s later than me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let go of me. Ma Teng, why are you always around. I already came here, and you still captured me!” An angry roar sounded from the woods.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon, everyone saw that Ma Teng walked out of the woods with a captured Qiu Yuan in his hands, and obviously, what was binding Qiu Yuan was an Immortal Binding Rope.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Buzz.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the keys in everybody’s hands suddenly released a blinding red light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The lights shot towards the gate, and the twelve holes which corresponded to the twelve keys began to turn as well…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the dust from the mountain finally settled down, the gate slowly opened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The gate’s open, let’s go in!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment the gate opened, a group of people suddenly appeared out of nowhere, and furiously rushed towards the gate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, before they could reach the entrance, they were rebounded backwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Keys, get the keys!” Someone shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The people who were rebounded backwards immediately rushed towards Ye Zichen and the other key possessors.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re seeking death!” Iron Bull opened his eyes wide and swung his fists, sending the people around him into the nearby trees.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian and co. also did the same, and opened a path for Ye Zichen and the younger ones to reach the cave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jail King, who was about to enter with Lil’ White, was suddenly rebounded. However, Lil’ White disappeared into the entrance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s true, only those of the Human immortal level and below can enter,” Jail King frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the three Yao Emperors also walked over, and said to Ye Zichen as they sent the people trying to snatch up the keys flying, “Now do you believe us?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright. I’ll sell a key to you,” Ye Zichen handed a key over to the Yao Emperors. The Yao Emperors immediately handed the key over to their three juniors, and told them to enter together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Ye, let’s enter quickly. It’ll only become more disadvantageous for us the later we enter!” Ruan Qingtian said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded, then shouted towards Zuo Mo and co., “Come to my side!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Zuo Mo and co. raced over, Ye Zichen looked towards the three Yao Emperors, “Let’s discuss the deal when we return.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No problem, we’ll wait for you to come out here,” the female yao emperor smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen held up his keys, causing a barrier of light to appear and surround them, before they disappeared from the entrance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master, you go in,” Iron Bull grabbed Bian Tianrui by his foot a tossed him towards the cave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bian Tianrui held a key tightly in his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment, Mu Chengtian coincidentally walked out of the woods under the support of his lackey.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are they still fighting…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before Mu Chengtian could finish his sentence, Bian Tianrui smashed into his stomach. A barrier of light instantly appeared around the three, causing them to disappear together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two extra keys fell down from the sky…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Get them!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The surrounding people all leaped towards the two keys.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Hai shook his head with a smile as he disappeared into the cave, “What a group of pitiful people.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Earth Traveler Sun also shouted towards Ma Teng, “Hurry up and get in!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You hurry up and get in. Let me go!” Qiu Yuan kicked his legs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ma Teng snorted, “Brat, don’t think about running away. I still have to exchange you for money at the city lord’s manor when we come out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahh…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>What they didn’t notice was that the moment the two of them entered, several other young men also entered with them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As key holders entered Mount Supreme continuously, the two extra keys were still being fought over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoosh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A ghost-like figure suddenly appeared in the crowd, and snatched one of the keys, before disappearing into the cave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for the final key…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened? Why can’t I move?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Someone shouted angrily in the crowd.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very moment, a black-robed man appeared in front of the person momentarily holding the final key.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as the person was in completely shock was what was going on, the black-robed man yanked the key out of his hands, “Thanks.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, when the black-robed man finally entered the cave, the surrounding people regained their freedom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My key! My key!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The elder, whose key was snatched by the black-robed man, cried out. He had already been stuck at the complete stage of the Human Immortal level for too long, the end of his life was nigh. He had wanted to try his luck with Mount Supreme, but since his key was snatched away, he had already lost his chance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The candidates, and the Chosen One has already entered. Please leave!” An ancient voice sounded out in from the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon after, a soft wind blew against the people around Mount Supreme. When they realized what was going on, they had already appeared outside of where the seals were.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The person who left Mount Supreme behind was truly an expert. He actually managed to throw us out without us realizing it,” the three Yao Emperors couldn’t help but shake their heads and exclaim.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian and co. also couldn’t help but nod.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, the others who did not manage to get in either cried out in depression, or began to rage at the world…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wei Chen shook his head, “Let’s go back. It’s all up to their luck now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, at that very moment…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A beautiful figure appeared in front of them like a comet. Her eyes fluttered as worry and anger filled her eyes. “Where is Ye Zichen!?”</span></p>
