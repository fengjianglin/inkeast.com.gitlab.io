 <p><span style>Chapter 572 – A Bit Older, and Been Through a Bit More</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but hesitate when he saw Gou Yuzhan’s angry look.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What did he just say?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I brought him over!?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Stop kidding me. I haven’t even seen this ahoge ever since we parted ways in the Beast Region? How could I have brought him over here?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You tricked me and told me that there’s going to be good food after coming here. That’s why I followed you so excitedly. When we got here, you smacked me unconscious. You’re actually asking me how I got here? Are you trying to go back on your word!?” Gou Yuzhan’s ahoge wobbled back and forth. His look of absolute certainty completely shocked Ye Zichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re sure?” Hearing his certain tone, Ye Zichen was starting to even doubt himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course I’m sure,” Gou Yuzhan pointed at his own eyes. “I’ve carefully protected my eyes since a young age. I’m not far-sighted nor short-sighted, nor do I have astigmatism. I could clearly tell that the person who led me here was you.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the hell?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I’m sure that I’ve never went to find Gou Yuzhan, but where did the ‘me’ who went to find him come from? He actually knows Gou Yuzhan, and knows Gou Yuzhan’s weakness, and even brought him here!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“When did you come here?” Ye Zichen asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How would I know? You smacked me unconscious with a stick the moment we arrived. I’ve only just woke up and you’re asking me for the time?” Gou Yuzhan rolled his eyes, then stretched out his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?” Ye Zichen frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What else? Give me the good food. You said that you’d give it to me when we arrive,” Gou Yuzhan replied in a matter-of-fact manner. “If you give it to me now, then I can pardon you for your wrongdoings!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s expression immediately darkened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He let out a sigh, then took out his phone and clicked on the WeChat app.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Data connection failed. Please check your network settings.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>No connection?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen glanced at the signal bar, and noticed that the wave, which was usually there, was not.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait till we get out of here. I’ll definitely give you enough good food!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re trying to lie to me,” Gou Yuzhan wore an expression of disbelief, but his wobbling ahoge exposed his true thoughts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why would I lie to you? When have I ever lied to you?” Ye Zichen said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You lie quite often to me,” Gou Yuzhan twitched his mouth, then licked his lip. “But I’ll still believe you. I want to have lollipops after we get out. The same ones that cost 0.5 yuan like before.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What a dreamy young man. Since his request is so humble, I can’t exactly say no.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure,” Ye Zichen nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then Gou Yuzhan smiled. Then he blinked and looked around, “What is this place?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know,” Ye Zichen answered, then looked at the map in his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long later, Gou Yuzhan scratched his head, “Boss Ye, someone said in my head that I should team up with someone. What’s that for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re a player too!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was surprised, but he quickly understood. </span><i><span style>So everyone in here are part of that guy’s games. But then again, this is good, since I don’t need to worry about getting a teammate.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Check if you’ve got any jade pendants on you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What jade pendant? I don’t know any jade pendant,” Gou Yuzhan shook his head. At that very moment, a jade pendant fell down from him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen smiled, then picked it up from the ground, but Gou Yuzhan immediately tried to snatch it away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?” Ye Zichen asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My mom left me that jade pendant. Hurry up and give it back,” Gou Yuzhan reached out his hand and snorted. He recently learnt how to swipe treasures from his dad over on Mount Huaguo. The pendant was something he picked up form the floor when he just woke up. He had noticed that it was no ordinary item immediately.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’ll definitely sell for a lot when I bring it back. I can buy plenty of nice food.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>That was why he was rather anxious when it fell into Ye Zichen’s hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your mom left it for you?” Ye Zichen shook his head speechlessly. Then he took out his own jade pendant, and continuously swapped them around before opening his hands towards Gou Yuzhan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Say, which one of these is the one your mom left you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gou Yuzhan’s ahoge stood up. The two jade pendants were identical, so he really couldn’t differentiate them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Seriously, your mom gave it to you…?” Ye Zichen shook his head with a wry smile, then chucked the jade pendant that belonged to him into Gou Yuzhan’s hands. “This jade pendant’s for you. Your mom left it for you, so you have to keep it safe.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Congratulations. You have completed the team-forming mission. You were seventh place in this game. There are still nine players who are alone. Please wait for the others to finish before the second task begins. It is your free time now. There are some normal divine artifacts in Mount Supreme. Good luck.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>An announcement popped up in Ye Zichen’s mind. When he came back to his senses, he saw that Gou Yuzhan was looking at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So you received it too.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gou Yuzhan nodded, “Boss Ye, what’s going on? Why don’t I get it? What team-forming? What divine artifacts?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen didn’t really have a proper answer for Gou Yuzhan either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He’d only found out briefly about Mount Supreme, and only got involved after getting a key from Ruan Qingtian. He doesn’t really know anything about it. However, according to his understanding as an otaku, they were playing a game.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A game where they could be killed at any moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s take it as we go. You’ll get it eventually. What’s more, weren’t you an otaku in the modern realm as well? Just treat it as a gaming test, and pass the levels to reap the rewards,” Ye Zichen smiled, then squinted his eyes. “I’m more interested in whether you are really sure that I brought you over here? Can you tell me what was going on at the time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not so sure either,” Gou Yuzhan scratched his head. “I was playing cards with the monkeys on Mount Huaguo. You… It should be you, suddenly showed up, and told me to come with you. You told me that there was going to be food when we arrived, so I followed, excited.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re not entirely sure?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah. That person looks exactly like you, just a bit older, and been through a bit more. It looked like you were discarded by the entire world,” Gou Yuzhan wrinkled his brows. “But he looked very much like you. Seriously!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A bit older, and been through a bit more,” Ye Zichen knitted his eyebrows tightly.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just who is he?</span></i></p>

 <p>I'm terrible sorry about the lack of chapters over the weekend. I was feeling really under the weather, and honestly, still am. I owe you guys 3 chapters in total from this weekend (1 from Saturday, and 2 from Double Chapter Sunday). I'll be releasing 2 chapters a day for 3 days to make it up to you guys instead!</p>
