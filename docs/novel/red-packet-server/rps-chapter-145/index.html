 <p><span style>Chapter 145 – Di Tian</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen looked at Huang Ming in confusion. This brat actually wanted to buy a Great Recovery Pill from him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Ming had said that these kinds of things were all lies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You sure you’re not just saying things?” Ye Zichen smiled playfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang Ming lowered his head and bit his lips, “Ye-dage, I know I had offended you a bit at the start. Just treat it as the foolishness of youth. I really need a Great Recovery Pill right now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you want the Great Recovery pill for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen wasn’t a petty person. Although this brat was rather prideful previously, he didn’t do anything too out of line.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Recently Ye Zichen’s relationship with Old Lord Taishang was very tense, so he definitely didn’t have any more Great Recovery Pills.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Huang Ming wanted to use the Great Recovery Pill to cure a disease and save someone, Ye Zichen could just use Old Lord Taishang’s medical journal to help.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Buzz….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s phone started to ring the moment Huang Ming wanted to speak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen took out his phone and looked at the caller ID. After indicating Huang Ming to speak later, he put his phone by his ear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Su Yan!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are Ye Zichen, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A rather gender-neutral voice came out of the phone instead of Su Yan’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are you? Why are you using Su Yan’s phone to call me? Where’s Su Yan?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen became extremely worried, and was beyond anxious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within a grand mansion, a man with his long hair tied in a ponytail like people of the Qing Dynasty sat on the sofa and shook the glass of red wine in his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked at Su Yan and Xia Keke, whose mouths were taped shut and were being controlled by two female bodyguards, with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn’t you say that you wanted to see me? It’s just that I’m rather lazy and don’t like to move. There was no helping it, so I could only make you come see me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Buzz!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen’s head exploded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was the person behind Hao Wen!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your two female friends are already in my hands. What I want is very simple, bring Hao Wen over. Two for one, it’s a good deal for you.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Two people?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen frowned, but he didn’t have time to care about that much.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay, I’ll bring Hao Wen over to see you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come alone, I don’t like to see too many strangers. Don’t try to do anything, your every move is under my surveillance. I will send the address over to you later. Remember, you only have an hour. After an hour, I will slice these two beauties on the cheek once for every minute that passes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll hurry over. You better not touch them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’ll depend on your speed. Alright, I’m tired after speaking so much with you. See you later.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, the phone indicated that the call had ended. Ye Zichen clenched his first, while his face turned terrifyingly dark.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye-dage…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ll talk about your Great Recovery Pill later. I have urgent business, sorry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen hurriedly left the restaurant and sped straight towards Dongfang Wenyi’s location.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the journey, Ye Zichen already dialed Dongfang Wenyi’s number, and when he arrived Dongfang Wenyi had already brought Hao Wen out to the entrance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Ye.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m taking him away.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen directly grabbed Hao Wen, who was like a corpse. From the looks of it, he suffered quite a bit in Dongfang Wenyi’s hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Ye, do you need our help?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need, I’m enough to handle this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen chucked Hao Wen into the car, then took out his phone, only to find out that the other person did not send him an address yet.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>F*ck!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen dialed Su Yan’s number, and after a while, the call was answered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Address, send me the address!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen clenched his teeth, causing him to look like he was about to swallow the person on the other end of the phone whole.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, the other person laughed as if he suddenly remembered something. “I was too busy playing with your two female friends that I forgot to send you the address. To be honest, I’m regretting wanting to exchange with you now, these two beauties…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F*ck you, grandson, I’m warning you, don’t touch them!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What use is there in giving a warning?” A playful laugh sounded out form the phone. “Also, your attitude is too firm, I don’t like it at all. Apologize to me, then shout ‘Grandpa Di Tian, I was wrong’ three times, then I’ll tell you the address!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandson, you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen cursed angrily, but Su Yan and Xia Keke’s screams suddenly sounded out from the phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t touch me, let go of me…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Di Tian, I said, don’t touch them!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Di Tian laughed sinisterly in the mansion, as if he really enjoyed Ye Zichen’s rage. He took his hands away from Su Yan and Xia Keke’s cheeks, then placed the phone beside his ear with raised eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what should you do!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ye Zichen, you don’t need to mind us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Riche Bro, don’t come, this gaylord is laying a trap for you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Di Tian slapped both of the girls, while the clear slap sounded out in Ye Zichen’s ear…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Di Tian!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come and seal her mouth,” Di Tian took out a handkerchief and wiped his hand, before throwing it on the tea table. At the same time, he put the call on speakerphone. “Don’t shout my name. If you don’t want anything to happen to them, then you know what you should do.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mmm…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mmm…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan and Xia Keke, who had their mouths sealed, both glared at Di Tian and shook their heads furiously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen, who was in the car, clenched his fists tightly, then opened his blood red eyes wide and said with clenched teeth, “Di Tian, you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My patience is limited, and you don’t have much time!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huuu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandpa Di Tian, I was wrong!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re too quiet, I can’t hear it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Di Tian smiled sinisterly as he swirled the red wine in his wine glass.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandpa Di Tian, I was wrong!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandpa Di Tian, I was wrong!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandpa Di Tian, I was wrong!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Each one of Ye Zichen’s shouts were louder than the other. Within the mansion, Su Yan and Xia Keke, who had their mouths sealed, continuously shook their heads, and when they heard the shouts from the phone, tears started to flow uncontrollably.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Look at how lucky you are, he is even giving up his dignity for you,” Di Tian smiled playfully. Then he glanced over at Su Yan and Xia Keke who were continuously sobbing, before turning off the speakerphone and laughing. “I’ll send the address over to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Di Tian, remember what you said. When I get there, if I see them…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I said that I really hated people threatening me,” Di Tian directly retorted. “You were just apologizing, understand? If you don’t want them to get hurt, then hurry over in the predetermined time!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then hurry up and send me the address!” Ye Zichen was already slightly hysterical.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noticing that, Di Tian smiled and shrugged, “Alright, since you called me grandpa just now, I can’t be too mean to my grandson.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Was it enough, if it is, then please send me the address,” Ye Zichen acted beyond humble. He had no other choice, he couldn’t act strong in this sort of circumstance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Never mind, I won’t bully you anymore. Come.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long after the call ended, a message appeared on his phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the address that Di Tian sent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stepped down on the gas pedal, and sped over with red eyes.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Di Tian, just wait for me over there.</span></i></p>
