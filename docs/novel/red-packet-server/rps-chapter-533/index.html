 <p><span style>Chapter 533 – Awkward Date</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Chang’e approached him, Ye Zichen was able to smell the fragrance coming from her body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he stood stiffly on the spot, while he pondered about how to deal with the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Truth be told, everybody love beauties.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen could not deny that Chang’e was beyond beautiful. He was mesmerized the moment he saw her as well. Yet, at the same time, in the depths of his heart, he did hope that Chang’e had found him unworthy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It would have been great if their marriage string broke. However, the affability level merely rose instead…</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Houyi’s probably going to shoot me!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you upset with me?” Chang’e walked in front of Ye Zichen and said in a vexed tone. “The reason I didn’t come and find you immediately when you came to the Heavenly Court is actually because I was a bit worried. No matter what, we’ve never met before, and I wasn’t sure how I should face you, so I…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chang’e bit her lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing her young girl-like reply, he couldn’t help but shake his head, “How could I? I should have went to find you, but I’ve been busy in the Heavenly Court.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know you’ve been busy,” Chang’e smiled gently. “That’s why I came to find you. I’m telling you, I had to become super determined before coming over here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe… Is that so?” Ye Zichen maintained a coy smile. He wasn’t sure of how to answer at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uhm… Do you have time right now? How about let’s go out for a walk?” Chang’e licked her lips carefully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nodded, “Sure!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chang’e was a permanently controversial person in the Heavenly Court, so her appearance summoned the appearance of many paparazzi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is so annoying!” Chang’e frowned when she sensed the people tailing them.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Following me normally was one thing, but today is my first day with Sky Sovereign. These damn people are actually still following us!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Never mind, just let them follow us. It’s not like they’re affecting us,” Ye Zichen replied with a smile. The reason he said that was because he wanted to use these people to spread the news.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Chang’e’s male fans might rush out to fight him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he could stop worrying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However…</span></p>
 <p><span style>A paparazzi shared the photos of Ye Zichen and Chang’e going on a walk in the Red Packet Server.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Isn’t this my bro and Chang’e!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Canopy Marshal: Sky Sovereign finally meets with the fairy. Ai, to be honest, I really do feel kind of uncomfortable!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Handsome: Haha, a capable man and a beautiful woman, they really do suit each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Thunder: There are plenty of Chang’e fanboys here, right? I, Leizhenzi, is going to say it right now. Whoever dares to destroy the date between my bro and Chang’e… Heh, the consequences are dire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Lao: +1</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: Leizhenzi is right. I, Yang Jian, is going to say it here as well. Whoever dares to go and destroy it… Hmph.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha: No destroying Sky Sovereign and Chang’e-jiejie’s date, otherwise, I’ll get angry as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Monkey King: My, Old Sun’s, Jingu Bang is specifically made to beat those who destroys my bro’s relationship.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing several of the major deities in the Heavenly Court all speak up at the same time, the other deities who wished to do something after seeing the photos all gulped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chang’e might be nice, but their lives were more important.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Erlang Shen: I really wonder which step can my bro reach with Chang’e. When is he going to hold the wedding feast?</span></p>
 <p><span style>God of Food: I’ll go and cook for it personally.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha: I want to be the flower boy!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immortality Peach Fairy: Hehe, I’ll go and be the bridesmaid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third Prince Nezha: Oh yeah, I’ll go and be the best man!</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the deities in the group began to chitchat. However, at the same time, Ye Zichen was mocking the deities in the Heavenly Court to death. </span><i><span style>Are they real fans or not!? Chang’e and I have already walked around for nearly an hour, but nobody came to cause trouble at all!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>What was even more awkward was that they had walked in complete silence the entire time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To be honest, even though he was accompanied by a beauty, he wanted to end the silent date quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why aren’t you speaking?” Chang’e bit her lips as if she had noticed how strange the atmosphere was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not good with words,” Ye Zichen smiled apologetically. </span><i><span style>I can’t exactly tell her what I’m thinking.</span></i><span style> Therefore, he could only pretend like he was a bit simple.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Normally girls don’t like these kind of dull people, perhaps Chang’e…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, that’s nice. You’re a lot better than those people who only know flowery words.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dingdong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Your affability level with Chang’e increased by 50. Current affability level: 2165.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ugh.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen nearly coughed up blood. </span><i><span style>The affability level actually rose!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“O-Oh!” Ye Zichen smiled helplessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since she found out that he “wasn’t good with words”, Chang’e instead took upon the role of finding the topic, “Let me tell you, Jade Rabbit and I have been working for Yue Lao. We’ve been figuring out so many types of snacks and clothes for the womenof the Heavenly Court. They’re all super popular in the Heavenly Court!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that so?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh course,” Chang’e smiled proudly. Then pointed at a fairy, who walked by them. “She’s wearing something that I designed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Amazing!” Ye Zichen really didn’t know how to respond.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, after that, Chang’e turned silent as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was someone who was poor with words as well, and her silence only caused an awkward atmosphere to surround them once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait!” Suddenly, Ye Zichen looked towards the north.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that, Chang’e looked at him and raised her eyebrows, “What happened?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Ye Zichen’s eyebrows knitted closely together, then sprinted towards the north.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, Chang’e also followed suit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened here?” The Heavenly Court’s deities filled the area around the North Heaven’s Gate as they all glanced forward curiously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen squeezed through the crowd, then walked over, only to see a heavenly soldier laying on the ground with a blackened face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yang Jian, what happened here? I felt a strange aura over here just now!” Ye Zichen walked over and glanced at the soldier on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing Ye Zichen, Yang Jian raised his eyebrows, “I don’t know. I only came over since I felt some weird aura over here, but when I arrived, this heavenly soldier was already on the ground.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen frowned and squatted down before the soldier, then flipped open his eyelids, and checked out his situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen could not see any wounds on him, nor any hints of battle in the surroundings. What’s more, as a heavenly soldier, the soldier naturally wouldn’t have any sudden illness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is strange,” Ye Zichen frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Jian patted his shoulders, “Don’t think about it anymore. Report this to the Jade Emperor and let him decide what to do.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter what, this was the Jade Emperor’s territory, so Ye Zichen can’t exactly act out of line.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright then.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay, everybody leave. Return to your positions. Jade Emperor will deal with this personally, so you guys can leave now!”</span></p>
