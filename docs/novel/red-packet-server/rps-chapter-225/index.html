 <p><span style>Chapter 225 – Yu’s Request</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cough cough.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen coughed dryly. </span><i><span style>This brother is seriously…</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>He actually still dared to say that despite getting controlled by my people.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Just what should I say to you?” Ye Zichen shrugged helplessly, then advised earnestly. “Didn’t I already tell you very clearly last time that you just can’t kill me? Why are you so hell bent on attempting it!? I didn’t give you the healing pill for you to recover and cause trouble for me. You have to learn to thank people, bro!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Hou told me to kill you!” Yu’s eyes were sinister and cold like that of a poisonous snake’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But the problem is that you can’t kill me,” Ye Zichen let out a sigh, then signaled Fourth Hou to release Yu. “Be honest with yourself. Can you kill me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No!” Yu replied without any sort of hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bro, then why do this!?” Ye Zichen showed a troubled expression. </span><i><span style>Why did this guy have to be so stubborn?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Just as both sides came to a stalemate, Yu suddenly put his hand into a pocket at his waist. Third Hou instantly stood in front of Ye Zichen to protect him, while Fourth Hou dashed forward…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu took Fourth Hou’s punch, and slammed into the wall of the room. However, he still carefully protected the thing in his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That thing…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that Fourth Hou was going to attack again, Ye Zichen quickly stopped him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t this the pill I gave you? You didn’t eat it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to know where you got this,” Yu disregarded the injuries on his body and walked over with the pill. However, Fourth Hou stopped him at a three meter distance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your recovery ability is pretty good. You actually managed to more or less recover without taking the pill,” Ye Zichen raised his eyebrows and smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Yu continued to look at him seriously, “I want to know where this pill came from.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Speaking with you is so tiring,” Ye Zichen rolled his eyes in annoyance. “Why do you care so much? If you feel like it's poison, then just give it back to me, it’s rather expensive!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen was speechless. </span><i><span style>I gave him the pill, yet he still has so many issues, seriously…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“This is very important to me,” Yu, who was bad with words, suddenly shouted, instantly shocking Fourth Hou who was beside him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fourth Hou kicked Yu and cursed, “Are you trying to scare our Boss Ye? What are you shouting for? Are you just trying to show that you’re loud!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fourth Hou!” Ye Zichen called out, causing Fourth Hou to release Yu’s collar. “This pill is mine, I’m the producer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you sure?” Yu asked in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen merely nodded, “Why should I lie to you for no reason?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Ye Zichen finished, Yu looked at him blankly, then kneeled onto the floor, “Please help me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This kneel completely shocked Ye Zichen. </span><i><span style>This bro was arguing with me just moments earlier, why did he kneel now?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen hurried over to help him up, but it was as if Yu’s leg were covered in superglue and he just wouldn’t get up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not getting up until you agree! Please help me!” Yu’s expression was filled with anticipation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen licked his lips and squatted beside Yu, “Then do say how I’m supposed to help you. How am I supposed to help you if you don’t actually tell me what it is?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to ask you to help me take a look at a patient!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Such a puny matter actually caused so much trouble.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen truly did not understand Yu’s thoughts. </span><i><span style>Couldn’t he just directly ask me to go and save someone?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It was fortunate that it was in the room, if it was outside, and was seen by some bystanders who didn’t know what was going on, I might end up in the headlines tomorrow.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, I’ll help, now you can get up, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you, if you can save her, then my life is yours!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He’s still kneeling!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I’ve already promised you and yet you’re still kneeling!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I told you to get the f*ck up! If you still want me to help you, then stand up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>………</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was very hard to imagine that a Spiritual Body leveled expert like Yu actually lived underneath a bridge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen stood in front of the arc of the bridge and smoked. Yu said that his friend was still in the hospital, he had asked Ye Zichen to wait here for a moment, while he went to get her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ta, ta.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A series of quick footsteps sounded out. Not long later, Yu hurried over with a pale-faced girl, whose eyes were tight shut.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The girl was in her teenage years. Her breathing was faint, but strong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was clear that this woman had a very strong will to live, but she was sick…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The friend you were talking about is her?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>No matter how I look at it, Yu seems to be of her father’s generation. Could he be an old cow that eats young grass?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Zeze…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu nodded silently, then placed the girl softly on a piece of torn cloth underneath a bridge. At the same time Ye Zichen reached his finger out to feel the girl’s pulse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked up at the girl’s pale face and the painful expression.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s going on? She’s not sick at all.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Not only was the girl not sick, her body was even a lot healthier than normal people.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen removed his hand from her wrist with a frown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu immediately went up to him with a nervous expression, “How is she?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen signaled him to be quiet, then his eyes flashed with a ray of gold light.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Fiery Eyes of Truth, activate!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He scanned the girl’s body, then Ye Zichen’s frowned eyebrows deepened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did the girl go through before?” Ye Zichen looked to the side with a frown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Yu lowered his head and did not say anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s fine if you don’t say it, I’ll just tell you directly, this girl isn’t sick at all. Not only is she not sick, she’s a lot healthier than normal people!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s impossible, why is she not waking up if she isn’t sick?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She’s lacking a spiritual soul!” Ye Zichen squinted his eyes. “Out of the three spiritual souls and six physical souls, she’s lacking a spiritual soul.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen couldn’t help but be a bit scared after saying that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Back then, he didn’t know anything. That grandson, Xie Lei, had asked him for a spiritual and a physical soul. He nearly gave it to the brat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was fortunate that he didn’t…</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So it’s like this,” Yu did not show any surprise, and instead sat on the ground with a look as if he knew it, while his eyes were filled with trouble.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You guessed it already?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>From the looks of it, he clearly knew that it would be the result.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Mhmm,” Yu nodded, while emotions arose in his eyes. “I guessed the possibility, but I didn’t think that it would actually be the case.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You believe my words?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Naturally, the fact that you can take out that sort of pill means that you have no need of lying to a useless person like me,” Yu squinted his eyes, then signs of a struggle rose up from his lifeless face. “Ling’er, don’t blame uncle, I can’t save you, so I can only let you leave more comfortably!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, Yu suddenly smacked towards the girl with his right hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the moment that his hand was about to land on the girl’s head, Ye Zichen suddenly caught his arm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you doing?” Yu’s eyes were filled with a savage light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Zichen licked his lips and answered speechlessly, “I do want to ask just what are you doing. Doesn’t she just lack a spiritual soul? Isn’t it fine if we just find it!?”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Original Chapter Teaser:</b>[expand]</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>My name is Yu. Like a stereotypical underling of a villain, I have potential, great enough potential that the main character would waste his breath over and over again like Naruto in order to make me change my thoughts.</p>
 <p>Like a typical anime villain nowadays, I'm not pure evil. I'm only giving up my dignity, pride and morals in order to save a girl. She's sick, and without Young Master Huo's aid, there is nothing I can do to save her.</p>
 <p>That being said, Young Master Huo's orders this time was simple - kill a guy who is a weaker cultivator than me. I thought it would be an easy thing to do, and I nearly succeeded the first time, if I did not bother following the rules set by the strong. Then, on my second attempt, I failed terribly and found out that I most likely will never succeed.</p>
 <p>Like a typical anime MC, the target of my assassination, has offered me some aid. Now, after some twist and turns, I have decided to ask him for help. After all, it's not like I tried to kill him twice, right?</p>
