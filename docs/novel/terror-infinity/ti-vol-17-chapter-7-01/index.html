<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Zero’s shot was so powerful that it blasted a robot with one hit. That was without using the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception. Not even cultivators like Luo YingLong could withstand a hit on the point of death. The robot exploded and Gando descended from above. The Valkyrie stepped onto a blue robot. The progressive blade stabbed downward but missed the robot and slid off from its armor, igniting a string of flares.</p>
 <p>“That is a first generation Decepticon that came from space. It’s the leader of this group and possesses much tougher armor. Take down the other robots instead!” A troop yelled. They had obviously realized the transforming mecha belonged to neither the Decepticons nor Autobots. The identity of the new party were still unknown to them but the strength they had shown that rivaled the robots gave them hope.</p>
 <p>The blue robot displayed its superiority over the other Decepticons as it turned around and seized the Valkyrie’s foot. It smashed the Valkyrie to the ground.</p>
 <p>“Do you think EOT is so easily defeated?” A stream of electricity burst out from the Valkyrie’s other foot. The armor that withstood the progressive blade was fragile as paper in the presence of this electricity. It sliced through the armor without friction. The control sticks danced madly under Gando’s hands. His hands had nearly disappeared from sight due to their speed and sparks occasionally flare up.</p>
 <p>What was even more stunning were the movements of the Valkyrie. Its hands pressed on the ground and pushed it up several meters. The Valkyrie mounted on the top of the blue robot. Hundreds of missile openings were exposed over all areas of the Valkyrie and all aimed at the blue robot’s chest.</p>
 <p>“Go to hell! All fire!” Gando shouted. The guided missiles, reaction missiles, micro missiles all blasted onto the blue robot from such a short distance. The explosions enveloped both robots and a large area around them. Several robots within the area were blasted away.</p>
 <p>Zheng and his party rose to nearly two thousand meters above. Kampa’s rapid fire RPG began to roar. This was also a future sci-fi weapon. Its size and weight limited the user to one with a big and strong body. The RPG compressed and shot air in opposite direction to reduce the force of recoil. Kampa also enhanced his body enough to use the weapon at will.</p>
 <p>The RPG turned the battlefield into a sea of fire nearly instantaneously. Dust and dirt blew up over ten meters in multiple places. The unlimited ammunition nature of the weapon kept the explosions happening without a pause. It wasn’t until the Valkyrie flew out in its jet mode did Kampa slowed down.</p>
 <p>The troops were stunned by what they saw. American troops were proud of their technology and mechanical militarization before the appearance of the Transformers. They were at the top of the top among all the armed forces in the world. However, that changed when the Transformers came with more advanced, more powerful weapons. Their numbers increased at a horrifying rate. They had bodies that were extremely difficult to take down. They could wipe out an army of tanks with under a hundred robots. And now one small robot and a strange flying device destroyed these Transformers in under ten minutes.</p>
 <p>Team China were not relieved despite destroying this group of Decepticons with ease. The strength the Decepticons displayed was nothing to overlook. Just a few dozen of them had depleted over 80% of the Valkyrie’s energy. They could rely on the American military to resupply the ammunition but only Zheng could recharge Qi.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, the Valkryie’s energy storage unit was much larger than their Dragonshard necklaces. What would happen if the other members came under attack by so many Transformers? What would happen if the Transformers came in numbers over hundreds? Everyone’s face looked terrible from just the thought of this possibility. The Sky Stick descended onto the troops. Zheng discussed with Xuan and HongLu on the way then walked off the Sky Stick.</p>
 <p>The troops came up to them. A colonel held out his hand to Zheng and said. “Andrew Roosevelt. We thank you for the aid that prevented the annihilation of our regiment. Which division do you belong to?”</p>
 <p>Zheng said. “Ahem. You can call us Terminators… Let us leave this place first. Many robots are approaching from the city.”</p>
 <p>The psyche scan detected nearly three hundred robots of all sizes coming to them from the city. Most of these robots did not possess the ability to transform and many only two to three meters in height. These were probably newly created robots under the AllSpark’s power. However, there were also a hundred that could transform. The sky and land were taken by these varying vehicles. There were over ten jets, ten helicopters, and many tanks, firetrucks, vans and other cars. The scene from the psyche scan was magnificent.</p>
 <p>The colonel shouted to his troops and gave orders to the lieutenants. “Do you have any plans? Care to come with us to Shelter 7? The nearby civilians are migrating to the shelter. Your firepower will be able to cover the migration.”</p>
 <p>Zheng looked to his team then turned back to the colonel and accepted the request. Gando stayed inside the Valkyrie while the rest of the team sat on the Sky Stick. This alloweed them to fight back or run if the robots caught up to them. Three hundred robots were not a joke.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, the robots stopped chasing after reaching ten kilometers beyond the city. The human party had long left the area by the time they arrived. They looked over at the robots in the distance then entered the mountain under the sight of the robots.</p>
 <p>“Megatron seized the AllSpark from the boy. The Autobots were no match for him and he left with the AllSpark. A few days later, a robot uprising stormed New York. All mechanical objects turned into deadly robots under the power of the AllSpark. You thought those three hundred robots in the city were a lot? There were hundreds of thousands in New York on that day. The AllSpark’s power spread from New York and our fighter jets, tanks, and other weapons turned to robots. Only these old tanks are not affected by its power. We wouldn’t have lost so fast otherwise…”</p>
 <p>Lan confirmed there were no robots in the area via psyche scan, so Zheng came down from the Sky Stick. He built up rapport with the colonel to gain information on this world. The colonel obviously valued team China and told everything he knew.</p>
 <p>Zheng frowned. “It sounds like only a week has passed since the battle over the AllSpark. What happened to the Autobots?”</p>
 <p>The colonel smiled bitterly. “Who knows? Perhaps they have died. Or perhaps they have turned into Decepticons. Humans no longer place our hope on them. All the major and middle size cities in the U.S. have been destroyed. Robots swarmed all modernized cities throughout the world, Japan, China, India, Europe, and even the drilling rigs in the Middle East have turned into robots… Extinction to humans is near.”</p>
 <p>The party climbed over a hill that wasn’t too steep. A valley came into sight. Tents were set up throughout the valley. This was Shelter 7.</p>
