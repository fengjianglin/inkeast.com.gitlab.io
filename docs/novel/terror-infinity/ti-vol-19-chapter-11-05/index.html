 <p>Li-Kong continued chasing after Rui-Kong without any change. However, it was impossible to not notice the connection established to his mind. A hint of cautiousness was added to his movements.</p>
 <p>This was the moment Rui-Kong was waiting for. When one was overwhelming his opponent with pure power, the hint of cautiousness became a flaw. He no longer put forth everything he had in this process.</p>
 <p>Rui-Kong’s delicate white hand gently held the incoming fist. It appeared so feeble and light, yet her hand guided the fist off its direction. Then her palm struck Li-Kong’s chest with a thump. As her palm hit the target, she leaped backward. The tide of the battle reversed in the blink of an eye.</p>
 <p>Li-Kong’s two meter tall body trembled at the strike. Rui-Kong’s hand might appear feeble but infinitesimal control utilized every bit of force at the point of contact. Even a buffalo would have died in that attack. Only those with a superiorly built body could withstand it.</p>
 <p>Li-Kong wiped the blood from his lips and laughed again. “Haha, can’t help it. We have similar power level in close combat, only differing by styles so I counter you slightly. But every time you begin to interfere me with your mental ability, you will gain the advantage. It seems like I can’t escape defeat if I don’t find a way to counter your mental ability.”</p>
 <p>Rui-Kong also laughed. “Good that you know it. Do you want to continue? Or do you want me to beat you until you are knocked out like last time?”</p>
 <p>“Of course we will continue… However, no one can know who’s going to get knocked out!” Li-Kong leaped at Rui-Kong again and the fight continued.</p>
 <p>Rui-Kong didn’t lose the initiative this round so the fight was in a stalemate. Though the situation was progressing to a direction unfavorable to Rui-Kong. She had a defensive fighting style which was at a disadvantage to Li-Kong’s style. Furthermore, several of Li-Kong’s underlings were rushing at the two of them.</p>
 <p>Rui-Kong snapped her fingers once more. The girls under her control ran towards Li-Kong’s underlings. She also sense the Li-Kong’s upcoming movements. Eventually, the extra knowledge allowed her to strike Li-Kong on the shoulder. This strike was much more powerful than the previous one and sent him flying. Li-Kong collided onto a tree several meters away before he stopped. His shoulder was dislocated.</p>
 <p>“Hurts…” Li-Kong spit out a mouthful of blood but he was still laughing. “And satisfying! Do I get to challenge YinKong if I beat you? You are not the one I truly want to fight. The one I want to challenge is YinKong!”</p>
 <p>Rui-Kong curled her lips and said in a scornful tone. “Oh please. You can’t even beat me. What gives you the confidence to challenge sis? Go back before I knock you out again.”</p>
 <p>Li-Kong got up abruptly. He clenched his teeth as he gave his shoulder a hard shake. The shoulder moved back into place but the pain was obviously intense. Sweat drenched his face. He put away his laughter and said in a serious tone. “I can’t go back… It’s not my habit to run from a fight once it has started. Rui-Kong, I have a mean to break your mental ability. But I really don’t want to use it unless I have to. How about you don’t use your ability and I don’t use that method? We will have a fair fight.”</p>
 <p>Rui-Kong shook her head but she was interested. “What method? Don’t you think it’s unfair? Mental abilities are part of my power just like your muscle. Why should I give them up to accommodate you? Would you feel happy if you win like that?”</p>
 <p>“I get it!” Li-Kong howled. His body trembled violently and his voice sounded like a roar. “This is a state I recently came in contact with… Don’t die!” His skin began to harden, transforming to non-human like.</p>
 <p>Everyone was shocked. YinKong yelled. “Damn it! Rui-Kong disconnect from his mind!” She dashed toward the two of them. But it was too late. Rui-Kong screamed as she grabbed her head and fell on her knees.</p>
 <p>Li-Kong entered the fourth stage. In the same instant, an endless sea of violent lust consumed Rui-Kong’s mind. She had received similar thoughts through YinKong before but YinKong always moderated the amount that she sent over. Never once had Rui-Kong experienced such a powerful burst at once. The violent lust felt like it was going to burst her mind. Pain, savageness, insanity came in all at once.</p>
 <p>Li-Kong’s body finished its transformation. The hardened skin made him look like a humanoid lizard. Seeing YinKong was running over, he gave a crazed laugh and said. “Perfect timing! I have wanted to fight you long enough!” He smashed his fist at YinKong. The two were still ten meters apart. His smash broke off a tree on the path and sent it flying at YinKong.</p>
 <p>YinKong was filled with anxiousness and regret. If she didn’t let Rui-Kong fight alone, the two of them would have ended the fight in less than twenty seconds and things would not have progressed to this stage. She kicked the incoming tree without holding back.</p>
 <p>Bang! The tree was crushed to bits. YinKong disappeared among the shattered bits. No one caught any traces of her except Li-Kong. He smashed his fist out and YinKong appeared at the same location as he expected. The series of actions happened in just a blink of an eye. YinKong was four meters away from Li-Kong and nearly twenty meters away from Rui-Kong. Li-Kong stood in between the two girls.</p>
 <p>“If you don’t want to die…” The smile was gone from YinKong’s face, only ice cold killing intent remained. “Get away!”</p>
 <p>Li-Kong’s eyes seemed lost. His voice was hoarse. “No. I want to kill. Suddenly want to kill you so much… Arrh!” Insanity overtook his eyes. He dashed at YinKong with a roar at a similar speed that YinKong displayed.</p>
 <p>(He’s fast. It’s not hard to avoid him but I won’t be able to save Rui-Kong after avoiding him. He seems to be lost in the insanity of the fourth stage. It’s going to be hard to pull him back. Do I… have to kill him?)</p>
 <p>YinKong’s heart skipped a beat. As Rui-Kong came into her sight, her eyes became sharp as a blade. She relaxed her hands in preparation for an all out fight.</p>
 <p>(Rui-Kong and… ZhuiKong. Let me bear all the sin!)</p>
 <p>As the thoughts flowed through her mind, she saw a group of people running over from thee distance. These were probably her team members coming to aid them after hearing the noises. If she couldn’t solve the situation, there could be two or three monsters in the fourth stage… And her team would die. She had to risk her life.</p>
 <p>“Come! I will end it in a minute!”</p>
 <p>Yet, she had no confidence on the time limit she imposed. Li-Kong also reached the fourth stage. Furthermore, the berserk state he was in raised his power by at least thirty percent. She had to take risks in order to attempt to end the fight within a minute.</p>
 <p>Li-Kong had gone completely insane. His eyes were red as blood. Saliva drooled from his lips. He looked like someone in a seizure if it wasn’t for the insanity on his face. He crossed the few meters distance between him and YinKong in an instant. He smashed his fist forward without any technique but the wind pressure accompanying it was enormous. YinKong had a realization that she couldn’t block this strike!</p>
 <p>YinKong was stronger than Rui-Kong after all. She didn’t back away. She moved half a step to the side. Li-Kong’s fist barely scraped by her shoulder by a few millimeters. At the same time, her hands grabbed Li-Kong’s neck.</p>
 <p>(What enormous power. I feel like my shoulder is going to break apart. But he has lost his rationality. He isn’t using most of his assassination techniques and lacked cautiousness. He lost!)</p>
 <p>Before Li-Kong was able to retrieve his hand, YinKong kicked the ground and leaped over Li-Kong, bringing along his neck over his head. With a snap, his head twisted to the back. The neck section of his spine fractured into bits. It wasn’t likely that he would live.</p>
 <p>YinKong did not give Li-Kong a second look after she landed. She immediately ran toward Rui-Kong. However, a powerful wind pressure came from behind the moment she lifted her foot. It was so sudden that she was flying the instant she felt pain from her waist then collided onto a tree.</p>
 <p>Li-Kong was standing behind her with his head still snapped behind. He didn’t die!</p>
