 <h3>Vol 14 Chapter 24-1</h3>
 <p></p>
 <p>Zheng was merely a regular white collar previously, at most someone with the potential to survive. This potential only surfaced after he revived the person he loved the dearest. That was also when he lusted to live on. After he was not alone anymore, he bore too much, friends, comrades, the blood of his enemies, the expectation of his love, and the hatred of his clone. It was all these responsibilities that made him the person he was.</p>
 <p>“Raising newbies as slaves was no doubt a powerful method to quickly become strong in the beginning stage. If God determines difficulty based on the strongest individual and the average of a team, such team won’t encounter movies that are too difficult. So a team can obtain large amount of points and rewards while staying within safety. That’s the biggest advantage to this method but it will eventually lead to the team’s destruction.”</p>
 <p>“It isn’t that evil submits to justice. History has long proved the only thing matters in this world is absolute power, so justice and evil are bullshit. You can be fair to some people but never to every single person. Same with being evil. This concept is the weak’s self comfort. The underlying reason they will fail is because they only see the surface of God’s realm and forget its true purpose.”</p>
 <p>“God doesn’t get people here to grind points and enhance themselves. If that’s the case, its designer could have simply modified its program to give every human the enhancements. When gods and buddhas soar the sky, vampires and devils roam the ground, the end of humanity would not be far away. Its true purpose is to make humans evolve. Raising slaves can give them powerful enhancements but their unlocked levels are certainly low. Secondly, they probably can only use abilities and enhancements from God instead of their own abilities. The probability of this is over 90%. We have experimented that self created abilities can exert 100% of their powers while exchanged abilities and enhancements are determined by your unlocked stage.”</p>
 <p>“The final question is every powerful individual has a fatal weakness. Like sharks are strong in the sea but are mere food for the cats in the mountain. Lions are strong in the plains but gets eaten by fish in the sea. Such a team may seem strong but are weak. Go meet with them, Zheng. Break through their seemingly strong shell and what’s left inside is merely rotten flesh. Team Africa is much stronger to be honest!”</p>
 <p>Zheng recalled Xuan’s words in his mind. He continued heading forward quietly with Zero. He had entered the first stage. As he used the unlocked mode more and more, he could stay within the first stage for a long time. When this time continued accumulating, he might one day be able to stay in it without any restriction. But for now, he had to unlock the genetic constraint to discover the other team.</p>
 <p>“Zero, how’s it? Can you see the environment here? It’s a little too dark.” Zheng said to Zero in a low voice.</p>
 <p>Zero gripped his Gauss sniper rifle then replied. “I can see it. I only enhanced my eyes after all. I can see up to several thousand meters in darker environments. Though the terrain here isn’t suitable for snipes. Oh and there are two Gauss explosive bullets left.”</p>
 <p>The Gauss explosive bullets were the expensive bullets Zero exchanged before entering this movie. They were of course extremely powerful. One bullet can destroy an area of several hundred meters, more destructive than tactical nukes. Zheng understood what Zero meant by that. When he failed to rival the enemies, Zero would use the bullets. He could escape the area of effect with the speed of his Destruction while the enemies might not.</p>
 <p>“Ok, I get it. Thank you for fighting along side me this whole time. I don’t want to see you fall in front of me again, comrade. I said it, we will fight together till death!” Zheng nodded.</p>
 <p>Zero also nodded. “Fight together till death.”</p>
 <p>Following Xuan’s plan, Zheng and Zero walked the opposite path. They searched for the way up. There weren’t many bugs in their path. Zheng easily killed the few bugs he came across on sight, including a blaster bug. The light blade of Tiger's Soul sliced the blaster bug in two without resistance and they continued.</p>
 <p>And so, ten minutes later, they looked at each other as if they sensed something. It was a very blurry feeling but they sensed they were being spied on. Zheng was in the unlocked mode and Zero was a veteran assassin. They were both sensitive to such sensation. They walked toward a more open area in the underground. Large numbers of huge fungus grew in this underground that it looked like a forest. They were walking into this forest.</p>
 <p>“Zero, they are about here. I think they can hear my words right now. Live on.” Zheng muttered to Zero. He brought out a pack of cigarette and threw one over.</p>
 <p>Zero caught the cigarette. He lit it and inhaled deeply. He nodded then walked under the shadow of the fungus. Zheng was the only person left standing in the open.</p>
 <p>Zheng looked around with Tiger's Soul in his hand. He activated the movement technique and jumped up along a fungus. A few jumps later, he stood on its cap. The spying sensation fell upon him again. He finally saw four people coming out from a tunnel far away. Two Caucasians and two brown skin people. The brown skins looked like they were cowering. There were numerous bruises on their bodies. Their expressions seemed scared. The Caucasians looked at Zheng with arrogance. They laughed out loud when their eyes landed on the sword.</p>
 <p>“Is it funny? White pigs. Come kill me if you dare!” Zheng shouted using his qi. The sound was loud enough for them to hear clearly. They stopped laughing but they still acted unconcerned as if they looked down on Zheng.</p>
 <p>“Team China? Yellow skin monkeys. I thought the black skin Africans were going to seize the victory. Didn’t expect you monkeys to win.” The man’s voice sounded right by Zheng’s ears.</p>
 <p>A silver light crossed the darkness. Zheng immediately jumped up. The light hit the cap of the fungus then it was completely obliterated. It wasn’t burned nor shattered but obliterated into nothingness.</p>
 <p>“Don’t hide. I have found your locations. There’s one holding a sci-fi weapon on the other side. Are you hoping to sneak attack on us? Haha. Let me tell you, we have BB defensive items on us, rechargeable all purpose defensive items. Speaking of those, these seemed to be items your ancestors created, called Xiuzhen items. All sci-fi weapons are ineffective against us, same with magical weapons. Your crimson sword won’t be able to hurt us. Just surrender. We still have to chase the other group after killing you. They are being surrounded by bugs. The brain bug is going to get them first if we don’t worry. Those points are ours. Haha”</p>
 <p>The Gauss sniper rifle resonated loudly. A bullet shot toward the man with the silver bow at speed invisible to the eyes. A golden light radiated from the man’s body. A golden barrier the shape of a bronze bell covered him. Klank! It was as if the bullet hit a real bell. The man was intact.</p>
 <p>(They are a team that raises slaves as expected. They carry the best weapons and defensive items. Their enhancements and stats are probably also extremely high. This man is indeed a powerful individual. Xuan, this seemingly strong shell may be too strong.)</p>
 <p>Although these thoughts crossed his mind, his killing intent grew even more intense. The same raising newbie as slaves, the same torturing of newbies, and are both Caucasians. Everything matched what his clone said. These two people may be members who were once in team Devil! If that was the case…</p>
 <p>“You must die!”</p>
