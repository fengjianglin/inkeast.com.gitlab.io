 <p>As Yingkong’s actions were too abrupt, Zheng simply was only able to withdraw Tiger’s Soul in time. Although his reaction speed was fast while in the second stage, how could it compare to Yingkong’s abrupt personality change? Within the blink of an eye, she was already sticking to his waist. Within one breath, when Zheng held Tiger’s Soul and wanted to slash at Yingkong, a single palm of hers was on his waist. She exerted force and pushed, while her other hand welcomed Tiger’s Soul. The palm of that hand just happened to block Zheng’s incoming wrist. Somehow, she managed to borrow Zheng’s backwards force to hook his wrist. A loud and clear sound. Zheng’s wrist joint was forced downwards, and Tiger’s Soul finally dropped to the ground.</p>
 <p>“This is how I fight. Little Yingkong, no matter how you attack, the best attacking method is whatever can kill the enemy… My attacking method is force redirection and control. As I haven’t overcome the heart’s devil of the fourth stage, the strongest power I can attain now, ‘infinitesimal control’ exhibits the limits I have reached. The magnitude of every bit of force, its direction, its changes. All of it can be used to display battle techniques and as long as my enemy doesn’t exceed me by far, I’ll have a chance for victory… For example, Zheng, your Chaos, Genesis Splitter. I admit, I wouldn’t even be able to resist that power for even a second. But if it’s other abilities, I believe I won’t lose to you.” Yingkong smiled sweetly.</p>
 <p>Yingkong had already completely changed to her main personality. Her abilities had already changed from one of an elite assassin to that of a genius rarely seen in the assassin clan in many years. From her words it could also be seen that she did indeed have other goals apart from fighting with Zheng. It should be to let her secondary personality understand some battle techniques more as a foundation for the final battle.</p>
 <p>Zheng’s wrist had been redirected, and he had been pushed over ten metres away. Tiger’s Soul had been dropped, but his expression didn’t have much change. His wrist hadn’t even stopped trembling, and he suspended his hand limply as he spoke. “Since you’ve already come out to fight, then I’ll use my real battle power… How do you feel if we start with Explosion?”</p>
 <p>Yingkong was still in that sweetly smiling look of hers that was adorable. However, in the next second, she stomped down with force. Borrowing this force, she retreated, while at the same time, her leg hooked Tiger’s Soul on the ground and sent it flying to her hand. The phrase a jade-like woman and rainbow-like sword perfectly fit the current her, as long as the sword was changed to a sabre.</p>
 <p>Zheng’s foot was already stepping on the spot she was at just now. With that heavy force, he actually caused the ground to sink down. Although it was merely Explosion, it was not just many times more powerful than before with his current body constitution and power. Each and every punch and move of his carried tempestuous intent. And with the comprehension and passing of the heart’s devil, his battle style had its own unique points, which was to use force to forcefully break through. Under such force, what kind of technique could block it? Just now Yingkong had precisely sensed his power, which was why under immense peril, she had dodged it. Otherwise, this foot wouldn’t just be stepping on the ground.</p>
 <p>“Good! You sensed my power which is why you moved right? Again!”</p>
 <p>Zheng’s speed after using Explosion could no longer be caught by the naked eye. When faced with a lower level opponent, it would be over in a flash. Only the level of Zhao Zhuikong or the real Zhao Yingkong could deal with it, but people on this level in the entire realm could be counted on one set of hands. Thus, Zheng did indeed have the qualifications to use force to break through.</p>
 <p>Zheng forcefully stepped on the ground, and the ground cracked once again. He borrowed this strength to charge towards Yingkong again. Although he only had one hand remaining, his momentum was as powerful as a thunderbolt. His entire figure turned into a blur as he attacked. The first to come was a fist towards Yingkong.</p>
 <p>This little girl Yingkong maintained her charming smile as before. She didn’t panic, lifting the Tiger’s Soul in her hand and chopping towards Zheng. It seemed weak and without much strength put in, but its angle was incomparably cunning. If Zheng insisted on continuing with that punch, it would be hard to avoid colliding with the edge of Tiger’s Soul. Although his body constitution was indeed powerful, it was still a far cry from Tiger’s Soul’s sharpness.</p>
 <p>Who could expect that Zheng wouldn’t dodge, and a pale white light suddenly appeared on his hand. This was created from when he compressed Qi in his palm. Using the infinitesimal control from the early fourth stage, he could be considered to be proficient at this kind of energy manipulation. Before the light blade from Tiger’s Soul could hit his hand, he was already grabbing the light blade and pulling it over.</p>
 <p>“Hehe, take it!” Yingkong giggled, and easily let go off Tiger’s Soul. Sure enough, Zheng forcefully retreated about half a step back abruptly. Yingkong actually had her body slip back in, her body squeezing into Zheng’s embrace, and her two small hands wrapped towards the direction of Zheng’s neck. It looked it didn’t have any strength put into it, purely looking like lovers playing around. Zheng was however breaking out into cold sweat. He had seen this before in Yingkong’s memories. A tug would cause an enormous amount of force and a light jump would cause a person’s neck bones to snap. How was this move that of a spar? It was simply that of a killing move. Zheng hurriedly retreated without even thinking about it.</p>
 <p>Yingkong had been waiting for this chance. That action had been a feint. Although it was said that when you take action, don’t show mercy, and if you show mercy, don’t take action, it was a spar after all, and she wouldn’t use an assassin's killing moves. She wasn’t afraid of close combat with Zheng, but only of him charging about like some rhinoceros. Thus, she started going on the offensive the moment Zheng retreated.</p>
 <p>Zheng could only retreat several steps in time, and Yingkong’s current speed was faster than him. She easily charged to in front of him. One palm grabbed towards the wrist that Zheng had lost control of, while the other came out of nowhere towards his chest, as if it was waiting for something. Zheng’s wrist was grabbed, and an acute pain was transmitted from his arm immediately. His other hand was grasping the light blade of Tiger’s Soul. Unable to think through it carefully in time, he threw away Tiger’s Soul at once, and a fist punched out towards Yingkong.</p>
 <p>Yingkong’s waiting hand in the air finally extended. She used her palm to block Zheng’s attack. That strike that seemed as powerful as a thunderbolt instead seemed as light and insignificant as a goose feather when it hit the centre of her palm. The force was uniformly distribution all over her body and the girl was sent flying. However, her other hand was still grabbing onto the wrist joint Zheng had lost control of. Under this force, she spun a circle in mid-air like a pendulum. Then, with a bang, Zheng’s arm actually twisted to his back. The power of Explosion combined with the momentum of her revolution actually forcibly snapped this arm.</p>
 <p>Zheng could only let out a yelp of pain in time. Before he could make any reaction, Yingkong behind him stepped down on the ground, jumping over to his front while still holding onto his hand. The arm had already been snapped and with the pull of this force, the arm was actually forcibly torn off in the instant she landed. The was a tearing sound like a rag tearing, and Yingkong had already jumped over ten metres away, the severed arm in tow. Zheng’s arm spurted out blood continuously, only stopping several seconds later.</p>
 <p>“Hehe… This level of power isn’t of difficulty to me. Zheng, I only have a few minutes. Could you be trying to drag this out until I fall asleep? It’s better for us to start the real fight. This speed is simply making me yawn.” Yingkong giggled. In truth, she had many misgivings about Zheng in her heart, or else she wouldn’t have started off with making Zheng’s arm useless. Only now, did she feel confidence in dealing with his Destruction.</p>
 <p>Zheng sealed all the blood vessels in his severed arm, even suppressing the pain. Only then did he finally look at the girl over ten metres away, who was still adorably giggling. Although there was some blood on her face and body, it only served to make her more bewitching.</p>
 <p>“If so… then this is Destruction!”</p>
 <p>Zheng suddenly started laughing. It wasn’t because he lost an arm, but because Yingkong’s power exceeded his expectations. If so, this could tip the scales in team China’s favour in the final battle. Thinking of this made him laugh. As for what happened next in the battle, it would depend on how long Yingkong could last.</p>
 <p>Yingkong was originally still standing there giggling, but in the next moment she waved her hand to block her front. With a lonely bang, her entire body was sent flying backwards. However, this girl was indeed still nimble. She stepped down forcefully at the moment of her fall, suddenly rolling towards the side, thus managing to dodge a punch directed at her landing position.</p>
 <p>Yingkong was secretly complaining internally. Just blocking this attack had shattered her bones, and this was the result after using infinitesimal control. Although a large majority of the force had been dispersed into the ground, the remaining force still hadn’t been something she could bear. And that wasn’t all...</p>
 <p>As an assassin, Yingkong wouldn’t have as many scruples as she did now when it came to killing. Put unpleasantly, she already had the chance to kill Zheng before when she broke off his arm. However, she had let the opportunity go as it was a spar. Truthfully, lacking a weapon, she couldn’t kill Zheng anymore when Zheng activated Destruction, unless...</p>
 <p>“Alright, let’s stop here. We said it’s a spar. If you unlock the mid fourth stage, you can indeed use that physique that lets you absorb energy. But won’t you be afraid of hurting us without having overcome your heart’s devil?”</p>
 <p>Zheng used Soru while in Destruction, and in the instant Yingkong landed on the ground, he had arrived before her. One finger lightly tapping her forehead, he smiled faintly and said, “That’s right, team China is strong. Not just me, but everyone is strong!”</p>
