 <p><strong>Vol 13: Chapter 1-1.</strong></p> Xuan and the other two watched Zheng fight the dragon without a word on the Sky Stick. When Zheng entered the dragon's body and exploded with it, Kampa and WangXia both shouted. Even Xuan who was always emotionless showed a hint of anxiousness. His fingers were pale from gripping on the books too hard.
 <br> 
 <br> After the remaining head of the dragon fell to the ground, Xuan drove the Sky Stick over and yelled. "WangXia, check the exploded parts of the dragon. Kampa, shoot down the annoying jets!"
 <br> 
 <br> Kampa aimed his EMP rifle high at the jets. The bullets penetrated the two nearest jets and they exploded before reaching the ground. He was raging and using this as a vent for his anger. The EMP rifle sprayed on and exploded several more jets.
 <br> 
 <br> WangXia rushed to the shattered pieces of the dragon's body. Yet, all there was were piles of broken flesh from the blast. How could he even find a trace of human from the piles? It seemed like Zheng was really dead.
 <br> 
 <br> Xuan fell to a silence at the scene. They couldn't stay in this place for long since the rest of the fleet was sailing close. If they didn't leave now, they weren't ever going to leave. Xuan was about to step on the Sky Stick when he noticed the dragon's head was still in one piece.
 <br> 
 <br> He said to Kampa. "Shoot the dragon's head!"
 <br> 
 <br> Kampa fired at it without delay but a translucent barrier appeared. It looked so thin and was about to completely fade away.
 <br> 
 <br> Xuan yelled. "WangXia, dig into the head with a knife. If this is a true dragon, there should be a dragonshard in its head. I suspect that's what gave it the immunity to firearms!"
 <br> 
 <br> As a soldier, following orders had became an instinct for WangXia. He took out a knife and ran over to the head without thinking. The dragon's blood was at least 50C, but he went all the way in.
 <br> 
 <br> Half a minute later, WangXia came back out as he coughed. He yelled. "You two come over here! Shit. Come bathe in the dragon's blood! I received notification that my cell vitality, reaction speed, muscle density, and immunization strength increased by 100 points each. Those blood entered through my skin and made my whole body itch."
 <br> 
 <br> Xuan and Kampa was surprised then they both ran over. Xuan handed the two books to WangXia and said in a serious tone. "Keep it safe. We need these two items to revive Zheng!" Then he jumped into the dragon's eye.
 <br> 
 <br> Kampa fired at the sky for a few more before entering. They came out panting after a short while.
 <br> 
 <br> Kampa laughed out. "Damn, we actually bathed in dragon blood!"
 <br> 
 <br> Xuan frowned. "It's unfortunate. If Zheng is still here, the ring or dimensional bag can carry the blood. If this is like the dragons in legends, its flesh, bones, and whole body are a treasure."
 <br> 
 <br> WangXia took out a irregular shaped jade from the pocket. The jade was about the size of half his palm, glowing in a soft white color. Xuan received it and immediately heard a notification.
 <br> 
 <br> "Obtained magical item dragonshard. Allows user to defend against long range high tech weapons by filling it with energy. Can sense energy fluctuation. Glows hot when it senses energy waves that are life threatening to the user. Accepts qi, blood energy, psyche force, magic, Nen, Xian energy."
 <br> 
 <br> Xuan said the notification out and surprised both Kampa and WangXia. However, they didn't have the time to ponder and followed Xuan onto the Sky Stick.
 <br> 
 <br> The Sky Stick lifted up at its fastest speed. At the same time, they saw a dozen helicopters flying at them. Xuan glanced at the helicopters and said to Kampa. "Give me fire support. Shoot down all the missiles. And hold on tight!" He sped up the Sky Stick.
 <br> 
 <br> The Sky Stick was slower than the jets but those jets couldn't get close due to the EMP rifle. Any jet that came close was shot down, even the missiles got shot down. Furthermore, the Sky Stick could fly under water. After they flew under water for several times, the jets lost their location and had to return to the carrier. Though that carrier might not even be able to let them land anymore.
 <br> 
 <br> The three of them were in a silence for quite some time until Kampa shouted in a rage. "F*ck. Say something, Xuan! The newbies aren't part of our team but what about Zheng? I won't acknowledge you as the leader. He's the only one that I can accept! F*ck. I won't ever let go of the guilt if we don't revive someone that died for the team!"
 <br> 
 <br> Xuan replied calmly. "Is there something to debate? We are definitely going to revive him. Team China isn't a team without him. Why do you think he gave us the books before he went? This is his only hope in coming back. God had notified us of a rank C reward and 4000 points. So each of us has gotten a rank B reward and 6000 points total. If we finish the third bonus mission, there's a high chance we can revive him."
 <br> 
 <br> WangXia muttered. "Didn't he say to give the third bonus mission to Gando? If you do this..."
 <br> 
 <br> Xuan replied coldly. "That's mere naive mercy. If we completed this mission without casualty, then it wouldn't matter to give him the last mission, since he has some talents and can become a member of the team. However, do you think I will consider such mercy after Zheng's death? Our highest priority is to revive him before the next movie. Which means I must obtain 2500 more points and a rank D reward."
 <br> 
 <br> Kampa asked. "What is the cost to reviving a person?"
 <br> 
 <br> Xuan said. "If the revival takes place in God's dimension, then it's the double of all the points and rewards he had received. This isn't possible since he had obtained too much. But the cost can be split among us three this way. Yet, for Zheng, we have to go to the altar in The Mummy's world. It costs a rank B reward and 8000 points to revive there."
 <br> 
 <br> "To open up that world, we will also need to use a rank D reward. Going from Cairo to the altar and back will take ten days if we consider the chance of accidents. I currently have 6000 points and a rank B reward so I must get 2500 more points and a rank D reward because I can't be certain if God allows us to split the cost outside the dimension. If we can't then one of us have to pay the cost alone."
 <br> 
 <br> Xuan stopped here and bit his finger. Then he continued calmly. "It doesn't matter if the newbies die. They haven't finished any movies so they cost nothing but their chance of revival to revive. The newbies can only be erased at this point. I will complete the third bonus mission!"
