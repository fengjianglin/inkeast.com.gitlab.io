<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>"I am a genius... Strategies and schemes aren't my trades but I am a genius when it comes to combat." This was the first line Lionheart spoke after he dashed in front of Zheng.</p>
 <p>He flew across the distance in the shape of a deep red shadow, which actually seemed impressive. However, the one standing before him was Zheng. After witnessing countless battles and the best of the realm, and after reaching mid-fourth stage, a single ability could not waver his mind. If he wasn't being cautious, he would have given Lionheart a punch to the face when he spoke.</p>
 <p>Zheng didn't say anything in response. He turned around and dashed right by Lionheart in a gust of wind. There was still a way before he arrived at the desired location for the fight. Once he got there, he would be cleared of all fears. Team Pacific only sent one person here so their psyche force user was somewhere else. If he unleashed his power and killed the team's leader too fast, it would become difficult to find the psyche force user, since team China had no psyche force user of their own.</p>
 <p>Lionheart was one of a kind. He wouldn't think so far ahead. When he saw Zheng dashed pass him without respect, his eyes burned with fire. The anger that was ignited by Julian rushed out and he shouted. A wave of deep red flame burst out from his body. The metallic deck under his feet melted into liquid instantly. The who area felt like it had turned into a furnace.</p>
 <p>Zheng planned to quickly get past Lionheart with Soru. However, he was surrounded by intense heat after moving less than a hundred meters away. His heart skipped a beat then he leaped. He continued climbing in the air with Geppo. A moment later, he landed several hundred meters away. The area he was standing on had been melted into a crater. The deep red flame on Lionheart's body was burning more intensely than before.</p>
 <p>"Oh. Your strength is actually worthwhile." Zheng became a little more serious after witnessing Lionheart's ability. He had seen a similar ability from his clone. It was a black flame that possessed unparalleled destructiveness. That ability was also self-created and was on the same level as Explosion and Destruction. Though when it came to the actual fight, the user was the deciding factor, and he had no doubt he would win. Comparing an individual's overall strength, he would be within top three of the realm.</p>
 <p>Lionheart laughed out loud then said. "I told you I am a genius in battle. This self-created ability is nothing like those you can exchange. This is a power that comes within the self, more suited to the user than A and even AA abilities. My high level Vampire bloodline is a perfect match for the ability in addition. Once I kill you and absorb your power, my flame will ascend to a black flame. Haha. At that time, you clone will no longer be a match for me!"</p>
 <p>So this dude was not all talk. He wouldn't be selected into team Devil if he had nothing to back himself up. His potential must be huge. He had a perspective of his own with regard to battles by abandoning all other abilities and enhancements and focusing on Vampire bloodline and a select few practical abilities. The points and rewards he obtained from enslaving the team were poured into the Vampire bloodline, rending the bloodline and its related abilities immensely powerful. His strength was above players who wanted to enhance everything but couldn't translate to actual combat strength.</p>
 <p>Zheng sighed. He unlocked the first stage, but that was only it. He hadn't decided to kill team Pacific's leader at this time. He was cautious at interfering with Xuan and HongLu's plan. He had an idea of the plan but not the details, so he didn't know if they calculated this situation he was in. Yet, it appeared difficult to leave if he avoided fighting team Pacific. Lionheart's speed in the shadow form was much slower than Soru, but he could maintain that ability longer than Zheng could use Soru. Zheng didn't want to become too distressed by getting chased.</p>
 <p>(Whatever, I will fight if I must. This guy enslaves newbies so there is definitely enmity between us in team Devil. I might as well tear him apart.)</p>
 <p>Killing intent surged within Zheng as he contemplated. He entered the second unlock stage. At the same time, Lionheart halted his arrogant smile and gave a shout. His clothes began to rip open. A pair of black bat wings spread out from his back. They were like the wings of a devil, and were similar to the ones clone Zheng had.</p>
 <p>"Do you remember what I told you?" Zheng sneered as he saw Lionheart becoming serious. "I didn't bother to look for you but you came to me. Did you think team China is made of paper? Come to me with a full team if you want to fight. Who do you think I am?" Zheng activated Destruction. The next instant he was standing before Lionheart who didn't even react. Zheng kicked him on the neck. The enormous force smacked Lionheart and his flame through the metallic walls.</p>
 <p>Lionheart was actually not bad. He quickly transformed into deep red blood after he crashed through the first wall. However, the transformation couldn't deflect the force and he continued to crash through several walls before he stopped. The blood turned back to human form afterward and he coughed a mouthful of blood. His neck was totally twisted. Not even a tank could withstand a punch in Destruction from Zheng. This was a force powerful enough to damage the prototype God. It was an accomplishment that Lionheart's body didn't fall apart.</p>
 <p>Zheng was surprised by his own strength too. His enemies had always been either too weak or too powerful that he didn't have a clear understanding of his strength. Enemies like the aliens were so weak he didn't even need to use the power of Explosion on them. Beings like the prototype God were too strong where Destruction became majorly ineffective. When he finally got the chance to fight someone on a similar level, or just right below him, he realized he had become a monster.</p>
 <p>Lionheart grabbed his head and twisted it back into place like a monster. He crushed the bones on his neck then a layer of red light glowed. By the time Zheng walked into the passageway Lionheart was in, the neck had recovered.</p>
 <p>"Impressive strength. Really impressive strength. You are stronger than how team Celestial portrayed you. Haha. Such amazing strength! If I can absorb this strength, I will become invincible! I can easily return to the real world. The whole world will be..." Lionheart seemed to have fallen into insanity. The blood and dirt on his face nullified his handsome appearance. The way he was looking at Zheng was like a maniac.</p>
 <p>"So, you didn't die. Vampires in the legends have tough life forces." Zheng sneered and rubbed his fists. He was about to beat Lionheart into the ground.</p>
 <p>Lionheart calmed himself a bit and laughed. "Enough with your Vampires. We are the Kindred. You also enhanced the Vampire bloodline, even though yours is a low level... Speak of which, I should consider you a genius like me for being able to utilize such powerful with your low level bloodline. Haha."</p>
 <p>"Retard." Zheng shook his head. He dashed toward Lionheart with Soru. His right first smashed forward with the force of Instant Destruction. However, a layer of deep red flame was waiting on its path. The flame exploded in a puff but blocked the force.</p>
 <p>Lionheart snapped his fingers and flame resurfaced on his body again. Furthermore, a fire wall rose between him and Zheng.</p>
 <p>"I told you I am a genius when it comes to combat... Let us start round two!"</p>
