 <p><strong>Vol 3: Chapter 6-2.</strong></p>
 <p>The first group to guard the scriptures was Zheng’s. They sat there in silence. Jie took out a pack of cigarettes and said, “Feeling irritated? Why did you get so mad over a little girl?”</p>
 <p>Zheng took a cigarette and forced a smile. “It’s not really irritated as much as I just don’t want to see another Xuan in this team. The type of emotionless nature that can give up on a comrade any time. I don’t want to see another one.”</p>
 <p>After he mentioned Xuan, all three of them fell into a silence again, as if his name was a taboo. Zero diverged the topic. “How did you get injured? Did she have a knife in her hand?”</p>
 <p>Jie also seemed interested in this question. Even though the fight was short, the artery on Zheng’s wrist was cut open. His enhanced body and vampire bloodline quickly healed the wound, but one could still see a trace of it.</p>
 <p>Zheng held up his wrist. “Can you believe it? She cut through my skin with just her fingernails, even steel can’t cut through it that easily. How can a sixteen year old girl’s fingernails be tougher than steel?”</p>
 <p>Zero’s expression changed. He looked at the wound carefully then said, “With just nails? Could she come from the clan of assassins?”</p>
 <p>“Clan of assassins?” Zheng and Jie asked curiously.</p>
 <p>“Assassins have existed since the ancient times, whether it was in Asia or Europe. The earliest assassins had superior skills and hearts cold as ice. They could kill normal people easily barehanded. These assassins also mastered a cruel training technique to stimulate human potentials… But as technology advanced and guns appeared, these type of assassins declined. The new type of assassin is adept in using guns. No matter how good your skills are, one little bullet from afar will kill you. So true assassins have almost disappeared.”</p>
 <p>“I have only heard rumors of it, that there still exist two clans of assassins in this world. One in Asia and one in Europe. They still have that training technique handed down from the past. If this little girl’s nails are really so strong, I think she may have come from one of the clans, and probably belongs to the inner circle of the clan.”</p>
 <p>Zheng recalled when she unlocked her genetic constraint. If it was a cruel training technique, then fear and death could lead her to unlock the constraint. Also the way that she handled the pain afterward looked like she was already used to this pain. Perhaps she really was from one of the clans.</p>
 <p>“No wonder she was so arrogant. If she can get along with us peacefully, she will become a comrade we can depend upon.”</p>
 <p>—</p>
 <p>At the same time in the girls’ room. Lan and Yanwei stared at Yinkong in shock. The blood on Yinkong’s clothes had dried but as she was getting on the only bed in this room without changing clothes; Lan and Yanwei annoyed her until she took them off. Even though Yinkong was mean to the men, she was actually gentle and well mannered when she interacted with the two women. After she took off her shirt, she exposed a pair of breasts wrapped around by a piece of cloth very tightly.</p>
 <p>A pair of breasts tied with strips of cloth abruptly became visible where a masculine chest was previously seen. The two woman couldn’t help but unravel the cloth on her chest with their hands, and a little while later a plump pair of white rabbits suddenly jumped out. The plump rabbits looked so beautiful. Both perky and pretty with no signs of sagging. Seemingly made of flawless white jade, prompting smoke to rise from both Lan and Yanwei.</p>
 <p>Yinkong hurried onto the bed and covered herself with a blanket while the other two women laughed.</p>
 <p>“Why do you have to wrap them up? It will cause them to deform and you’re more prone to breast cancer. Why don’t we take you to buy a pair of bras tomorrow?”</p>
 <p>Yinkong blushed and said, “They will get in the way if I don’t wrap them up. Others will also make fun of me and touch them intentionally. Mine are… too big. If I don’t wrap them up, they will just grow larger.”</p>
 <p>Yanwei got close to Yinkong and said, “Hehe, let me tell you. They will just get larger the more you wrap them up. Choosing the right bras can stop them from growing.”</p>
 <p>“Really?”</p>
 <p>Lan and Yanwei nodded. Yanwei stroke her hair and said, “Who are these ‘others’ that you mentioned? You’re so strong, why don’t you… kill them all? Men cannot be trusted, all men are disgusting beings!”</p>
 <p>Lan was going to say something but she sighed. “Yanwei, did something happen before you come here that left you in despair? Can you tell us?”</p>
 <p>She paused for a moment then laughed miserably. “Nothing special. My boyfriend and I drove outside the city and the car broke down. Then a bunch of thugs surrounded us. He ran away alone… Aren’t all men like this? Once they’re in danger, they’ll think about themselves first?”</p>
 <p>Lan sighed again. She recalled the last movie when Zheng was fighting like a madman… Not all men were like this.</p>
 <p>—</p>
 <p>When it was time for the second group, Zheng prepared a can of iced coffee for each of them. The two college students sat there discussing something in a low voice, while Tengyi studied the scriptures excitedly.</p>
 <p>Pah!</p>
 <p>Tengyi felt pain on the back of his head then fell forward. Two hands on the left and right got a hold of him.</p>
 <p>Ding put down the blood stained ashtray lightly. He and Renjia grabbed the scriptures with crazy yet relieved expressions.</p>
 <p>“These idiots. They never saw how terrifying those things are. They think it’s safe to just put the scriptures in the living room. They can all go die…” Ding and Renjia laughed in a low voice.</p>
 <p>“Will you take me along?”</p>
 <p>This voice scared the two men. Renjia pointed his gun at the origin of the voice. Yanwei was leaning on the wall in her sexy lingerie. She laughed and walked over to them slowly.</p>
 <p>“I don’t want to die, can you take me along? I will have to depend on you from now on…”</p>
 <p>—</p>
 <p>Zheng was sleeping soundly. After he got a hold of the scriptures, that chill and stress never came back. He felt relieved when he laid down. But somehow he was feeling colder and colder in his dream, as if something was reaching toward his head from the bedside. When that thing almost touched his head, a series of rapid knocks on the door woke him and the other two up.</p>
 <p>Zheng immediately woke up with a shock. He caught a glimpse of a white arm disappearing from the bedside. He immediately jumped up then heard Lan’s voice from outside the room, “Zheng! Come out! Those two college students stole the scriptures!”</p>
 <p>They hurried to the living room and saw Tengyi sitting on the ground with a pale face. By the blood on his head and the disappearance of Renjia, Ding, and the scriptures, it was obvious what had happened.</p>
 <p>Lan said hastily, “After we fell asleep, Yanwei apparently said that she wanted to use the bathroom. Then some time later the alarm on her phone rang. There was the word ‘danger’ on it. We ran out to take a look and found this situation.”</p>
 <p>Zheng touched the canned coffee then said with a livid face, “Stay calm, they couldn’t have gotten too far. Probably just got out of the hotel. We should be able to catch them… Zero, is your sniper rifle still in the backpack?”</p>
 <p>Zero was surprised by the question. “Yes. I put it in the backpack disassembled, but due to the high cost of Gauss bullets and magical Gauss bullets, I only exchanged five of each… you mean?”</p>
 <p>“It takes less than a minute to get to the roof, much faster than we can go downstairs. Get up there and find them then contact us… Then shoot their legs! I will take their hands myself!”</p>
