 <p dir="ltr" style="padding: 0px 10px; text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; word-spacing: 0px; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent">The general meaning of this move was to allow Magic and Refined Qi to collide in the body. This would cause an energy reaction similar to that of the Magic Cannon. The power the Magic Cannon erupted with was enough to sink a small landmass. Although the energy reaction within Zheng’s body was much smaller, but in a correspondingly small body, the result wasn’t inferior to the strike that could sink landmasses!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-5e9d86c8-4383-be92-d955-c8c3a33a89cb" style="padding: 0pt 7.5pt"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To a biological lifeform, this power was akin to the result of Genesis Splitting. The power that could be displayed was terrifying, and was indeed unimaginable. If Zheng could safely exhibit this power, one punch of his would be equivalent to a missile. A full power strike of his would surpass a miniature nuclear bomb by far. This power really wasn’t one a biological lifeform should possess. Zheng’s strength at that time was enough to single handedly attack and destroy the entire alien headquarter. Even if he went up against those legendary American superheroes, he had confidence into smashing them into a pancake. This power had in reality, far surpassed the limit that the mid fourth stage of the genetic constraint should possess… this was the power of the fifth stage!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="padding: 0pt 7.5pt"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“From my preliminary estimations, the time I can safely use this isn’t even a second. When I start to use this power, my genes will start to break down. Then the body starts to collapse due to the backlash. My body is already extremely tyrannical, and I can’t use this power even with the Dragon Transformation. I think my body should already be sufficiently strong, so the crux should be how to manipulate this power… I believe the domain of energy should be of the fifth stage, or the power of the late fourth stage. That’s all for now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="padding: 0pt 7.5pt"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ever since the usage of the genetic constraint was known, the reliance of the teams on God to become stronger had decreased to very low after their power reached a certain level. When increasing their personal power or overall team power, the two truly most important things were self created abilities and unlocking the genetic constraint of fourth stage or above. These two things were unmatched when it came to increasing power, even if one only had one of them. For example, that idiot Lionheart, had actually become terrifyingly powerful after possessing a self created ability. He had only died such an unjust death as he had met Zheng, who was using Chaos, Genesis Splitter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="padding: 0pt 7.5pt"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For the time being, don’t even talk about the difficulty level of a self created ability. The number of people in the entire realm unlocking the fourth stage genetic constraint didn’t exceed twenty people. As for those who overcame the heart’s devil and reaching the mid fourth stage, they could be counted on one hand. As for the late fourth stage, if someone really possessed that power, that person would definitely be clone Zheng of team Devil!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="padding: 0pt 7.5pt"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So, Chaos, Genesis Splitter can only be used as my killer move for mutual defeat. I can sustain it for about ten to fifteen seconds. If the final battle begins… I definitely won’t use this except as a last resort. But if I do use this, I have the confidence to perish together with my clone!” Zheng finally stopped when he reached this point, before sighing lightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="padding: 0pt 7.5pt"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xuan finally finished eating his tomato. He rubbed his hands. “Like this time? After you kick out once you lose a leg. When you punch out you lose an arm… You think this state nad power can let you fight with your clone? Don’t joke around, you’ll just become a punching bag!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="padding: 0pt 7.5pt"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Understood!” Zheng clenched his fists. “After becoming leader again, my genetic constraint didn’t have any increase or change. It seems like the extent of God’s control of the genetic constraint is only to the third stage… I didn’t have much hope towards this before anyways. The greatest gain in Independence Day movie is that I tried Chaos, Genesis Splitter and got to have direct experience in understanding it… and recognise our pride!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="padding: 0pt 7.5pt"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The surrounding people all felt slightly confused at this, and looked left and right at each other. After a long time Tengyi asked the question first. “Zheng… what is our pride?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="padding: 0pt 7.5pt"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Because we are team China!” Zheng resolutely nodded. “Without noticing it, we have already come so far. From when we entered this realm until now, we have experienced life and death, countless battles, partings and reunions, as well as great joy and great sorrow… So it turns out our team was actually this strong. I heard from team Pacific that how powerful we are is circulating among the entire realm. They have even placed us on the same level as team Celestial and team Devil.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="padding: 0pt 7.5pt"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zheng exhaled as he continued to speak. “This is only the beginning! Since we’ve already come this far, how can we lose at the last moment? Our team China doesn’t just have to live on, but also as the most powerful team in the realm! Our team China will surpass team Devil and team Celestial Become a legend among all the teams! Even if we leave this realm in the future or die somewhere, team China will still be the exception among the teams. We WILL be the strongest!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="padding: 0pt 7.5pt"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was looking at Zheng strangely. Even Lori at the side had the same expression, as this Zheng was very different from the usual him. It was as if he was a different person. The usually indecisive him was nowhere to be seen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="padding: 0pt 7.5pt"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“When I used Chaos, I felt death nearing so much. But I didn’t die, and instead obtained the leader authority… What have we been persevering for? Our petty and small wish of just living on met obstacle after obstacle. We really don’t have anything else left. The horror movie worlds, team battles, team Celestial, team Devil and God… Our enemies are simply too many. At that edge of life and death I finally understood. Since we can’t run away, why not just fight back? Everything, the two special teams, and even God, we will challenge them all! We will become the strongest team, and even trample God at our feet. Then… we will have truly lived on!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="padding: 0pt 7.5pt"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zheng was clenching his fists tightly, and was more or less shouting this, and the surrounding people were standing there in a daze. Only Xuan clapped as he spoke. “...Ignoring the other teams, in terms of strength, not even team Celestial may be able to challenge us. But are you sure we can challenge team Devil? Based on what I know, that team has my clone and yours, as well as Zhao Zhuikong and other strong people…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="padding: 0pt 7.5pt"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zheng resolutely nodded his head. “I still have all of you, my comrades… For wisdom, I have you and Honglu in tandem, so I’m very relieved for this. As for Zhao Zhuikong, I think you, Yingkong, should want to have a fight with him? As for the other strong people… All of you definitely won’t lose to them. I have a training plan. In the final break time before the final battle, I will exchange all the points and side quests into rest time inside the movies and high grade medicines for healing injuries and recovering fatigue. I need to undergo a final training there. Then… I will deal with my clone!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="padding: 0pt 7.5pt"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only now did everyone snap out of it. Although everyone was silent, none of their faces had different expressions. Instead, after Zheng’s resolute display, their expressions had a hint of expectation and calmness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="padding: 0pt 7.5pt"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Honglu sighed. “No matter what, let’s see what the next movie is. Since you want to go to a movie world to undergo training, and exchange various high grade medicines, you need to save large amounts of points and side quests before the final battle. I hope the next movie world isn’t the final battle.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="padding: 0pt 7.5pt"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The others all nodded. Only Imhotep and Anck Su Namun were still there kissing each other. While Heng was still there endlessly dispirited, the other team members were generally alright.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="padding: 0pt 7.5pt"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zheng laughed mischievously, and scratched his head. He shut his eyes and faced God, speaking after a moment. “The next movie is Eragon… It seems I’ve watched this movie before. It’s a fantasy movie about giant dragons battling. That’s strange… this counts as a horror movie?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="padding: 0pt 7.5pt"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zheng was talking to himself. Only after a long time did he speak up. “Alright, everyone go and have a good rest. Gather in my room tomorrow noon. We’ll have a good meal and rest, and only in the afternoon will we discuss Eragon. Right, think about whatever you need to exchange. You can raise it in the discussions tomorrow.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="padding: 0pt 7.5pt"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is unrelated, but…” Honglu suddenly interrupted, speaking with a strange expression filling his face as he half knelt on the ground. “The final battle should be in the next two or three movies. As for exactly how many, I’m not too sure…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="padding: 0pt 7.5pt"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why?” Zheng, Cheng Xiao, Wangxia and Heng asked in unision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="padding: 0pt 7.5pt"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is just a guess. Do you remember the plot of Eragon? There is a plot inside about how a young dragon transforms into an mature dragon within a short time. Although it’s just a movie, but did you all not think of something? That’s right… what if our young dragon also matures within an instant? We would possess a giant dragon over a hundred metres long, which is also our comrade. Doesn’t this horror movie seem like it’s specially arranged for us by God?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="padding: 0pt 7.5pt"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Honglu plucked off a strand of hair, and played with the hair. “I said it before, this is just a guess of mine. Before the final battle, God will definitely let all the teams make their preparations. The best would be if each team could reach their limit. If you think about it thus, this Eragon is really like the preparation process that God has given us. If this deduction holds up, then we’ll be entering the final battle in two or three movies. Because we still have so many members sleeping, we should still meet another team battle before the final battle… Those are all my deductions.”</span></p>
