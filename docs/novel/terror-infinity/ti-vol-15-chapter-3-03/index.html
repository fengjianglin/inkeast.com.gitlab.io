 <h3>Vol 15 Chapter 3-3</h3>
 <p></p>
 <p>The Mystic Eyes of Death Perception when activated allow the user view the world in lines and points. Its duration was a mere moment but if Zero could hit a point, the object would instantly collapse. The most important thing was that even barriers had such lines and points.</p>
 <p>The Eyes of Death Perception was a starting point in this series. The next up was A tier and its final form was AA tier, Balor’s Eyes, which could actualize the death of the target.</p>
 <p>“The Eyes of Death Perception is the initial enhancement. It only lasts 0.5 seconds. The lines and points will disappear after the direction so you have to use it after you enter the unlocked mode. There’s a twenty-minute cool down before you can use it again. The requirements are extremely strict. Furthermore, your brain would not be able to withstand the strain if you use it for too long, at which point it can cause brain death. However, it’s also immensely powerful. The eyes can find the weak points of even barriers. You can then end the target with a single shot!”</p>
 <p>Zheng could quickly search enhancements and items through God using his privilege as the leader. During this series of searches, he found many abilities and enhancements that seemed powerful. However, many were either expensive or not suitable to use for a normal person. These exchanges were categorized into energies, genetic enhancements, and enhancements focused on certain parts, like the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception he recommended was a Dojutsu.</p>
 <p>“There are many choices in this series, Sharingan, Byakugan, the Golden Gaze-Fiery Eyes. Though these don’t seem particularly useful. The Eyes of Death Perception is what you need the most. It will unleash the full power of your weapon and take care of enemies even if they have barriers. You just have keep doing what you always do, finish them in one shot!”</p>
 <p>Zero had stood under God when Zheng was still rambling on and on. He started the enhancement. A moment later, he walked back casually as if he just went over to get something. He wasn’t in the least bit worried.</p>
 <p>Zheng patted Zero’s shoulder. He knew Zero was a reliable comrade. This could be seen through the battle against team South America. His skills and tactics were way beyond what a normal person could achieve. Now that he had the Eyes of Death Perception, just give him a chance and his enemy would be dead.</p>
 <p>“There’s only Xuan and me remaining. What kind of enhancements are you looking for?” Zheng said to Xuan with a smile.</p>
 <p>Xuan shook his head. “I don’t have any special need for enhancements. I have 9000 points and a rank B reward left. Every person needs a rank D reward for Resident Evil. Ten members need ten rank D rewards, which is one rank B and a rank D. Since I don’t need any enhancements, I can use this rank B reward to activate Resident Evil. I will use the points for rare metals and try to modify the Valkyrie’s power system in these five days and craft a pair of mithril rings for you. the remaining points can be used on the three revived members. I am still doubtful about their abilities so I wish to carry out a practice before entering Resident Evil.”</p>
 <p>Xuan’s response surprised Zheng. However, as he thought about this, it was the way Xuan had always acted. He would maximize the interest of the team over any individual in all situations. All he considered was maximizing the interest.</p>
 <p>Zheng nodded and said. “Though I think there’s an enhancement that fits you. Lambda Driver body form. It will shrink the system and insert it into your brain. When your willpower reaches a certain level, you can use it to attack. I think you can take control over this system. However, it costs a rank A reward. We will see if we can come together a rank A reward after the next movie. That will increase the output of your Gauss pistols. You will be able to shoot through even barriers!”</p>
 <p>After all these, the last one to exchange was Zheng. He hesitated on what sword technique to choose. The biggest problem was this technique had to work with Explosion and Destruction. Every hit he performs in that extreme speed was powerful already. If he couldn’t increase the power of his slashes in these modes, he would rather not bother learning the techniques.</p>
 <p>(A lot of sword techniques but none seems suitable for use in Explosion and Destruction. There just isn’t a need for skills in those modes. All I need are precision at fatal spots and speed.)</p>
 <p>He searched related exchanges with his eyes closed, focusing on techniques that were fatal and fast. After quite a while, he finally found what he wanted. Yet, he didn’t know whether to laugh or cry at the result.</p>
 <p>“Technique, Ten Step Kill, rating 197. Suit users with extreme speed and reaction speed. Unparalleled power. Requires two rank A rewards and 10000 points.”</p>
 <p>This technique met all his criteria. He could obtain extreme speed in Explosion and Destruction. The unlocked mode would give him the reaction speed. The biggest problem was his thin wallet.</p>
 <p>Zheng couldn’t help it but searched a few more rounds but no other techniques suited his Explosion and Destruction. They might not even get a chance to be used if he exchanged them. So he’d rather save the points and see if the revived members need any weapons.</p>
 <p>Zheng gave up on searching and turned to the three members. He said to Yinkong. “What kind of weapons do you want? Dagger?”</p>
 <p>Yinkong was thinking when Zheng turned to her. She paused for a moment and said. “Any weapon will do as long as it can kill.” Then she became spaced out again.</p>
 <p>Zheng smiled bitterly. He knew what Yinkong was thinking. The battle against team Devil might seem so long ago for them but it just happened for the three revived members. Especially for Yinkong, she couldn’t put away that hatred so easily.</p>
 <p>Zheng was about to search for an assassination weapon when an idea suddenly struck him. He opened the storage bag and brought out the sword and bow. They didn’t get the storage item from team South America but these two weapons were rank A rewards. They could be huge if they can make use of them.</p>
 <p>He threw the invisible sword to Yinkong with a smile. She was still spacing out but the instincts of an assassin had her subconsciously reached for the handle of the sword when it came close. She swung the sword around then held it up. That was when she finally realized what she was holding onto.</p>
 <p>“It seems like only the person exchanged this item can use it. However, its invisibility attribute is still there. It can also annihilate energy. I think you will like an invisible weapon.” Zheng smiled at her. “Its name is Excalibur.”</p>
