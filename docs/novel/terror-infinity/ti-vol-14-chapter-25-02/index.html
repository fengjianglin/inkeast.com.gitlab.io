 <h3>Vol 14 Chapter 25-2</h3>
 <p></p>
 <p>Roste obviously never expected things to go this way. Zheng in Destruction almost couldn’t be caught by the eyes. The crescent slash cut across all clones and forced the golden bell to appear. Roste on the other hand seemed like he hadn’t reacted. Dong! Tiger's Soul cut an inch into the bell. It looked as though the bell was going to break.</p>
 <p>The shattering behind Zheng ended when he landed. He could feel from that sense of danger he would die for certain if he got caught no matter how strong his body was. The only except was if he had the body of the masked vampire.</p>
 <p>Roste was sent flying over a hundred meters away. The very first action he took as he dropped to the ground was split up his clones again instead of getting up. He realized that sudden burst of strength was so overwhelming that he had no other way of dealing with it. Fear finally filled his mind.</p>
 <p>After Roste split up, Zheng exited Destruction and returned to Explosion. It was his final technique. He would have no strength to continue a fight once he used up all his energy. He decided not to continue with Destruction until he figured out the limit to the defensive item and Roste’s other abilities. The cost to using it was too high unless it was the final attack.</p>
 <p>“How about this, we can stop the fight. A fight between the strong will only benefit the weaklings. I will give you two, no, three people from my team. One of them is unlocked. He’s extremely weak in close combat. You only need less than a minute to finish the fight. Let’s end our fight here!” Roste said with panic but he didn’t let his guard down. All the clones moved in the same way and showed the same expressions. He looked lacking in confidence.</p>
 <p>Zheng didn’t reply. He walked forward one step at a time. Yet, each seemingly small step moved him ten meters forward. This pressure forced Roste back dozens of meters. He finally shouted with anger from his shame. “F*cking. Do you really think you are the only one with a final ability? I have one also! Do you dare to try? I can kill you with this ability! I just don’t want to take the risk. Shouldn’t the strong work together to bully the weaklings?”</p>
 <p>“In my eyes,” Zheng said coldly as he took his steps. “You are the weakling!”</p>
 <p>Roste roared in madness. He knew peace was not an option from this reply. He didn’t know why Zheng seemed to hate him so much. He just knows that Zheng was much stronger than him. It wasn’t because of equipment or abilities. It was the aura of someone strong. This pressure made him feel terrified. He resorted to insanity to withstand it.</p>
 <p>“Ah!” Roste roared. He and his clones charged at Zheng. When Zheng raised Tiger's Soul, he surrounded Zheng with the clones just like before and used that restraining ability. “Mirage!”</p>
 <p>Zheng’s body froze with his arm raising the sword. About a ten-meter area around him was frozen. He could see Roste wasn’t in a good condition either. Blood was leaking from Roste’s lips but he still raised the sword. “Excalibur!”</p>
 <p>Light radiated from his hand. The intense brilliance carved the shape of the invisible sword, a two handed medieval sword. He swung the sword at Zheng and released a beam.</p>
 <p>“Destruction!” Zheng wouldn’t just wait for death. He activated Destruction. He could use a total of ten seconds in this state, nine seconds left after the first use.</p>
 <p>Everyone seemingly froze in Zheng’s sensation. He broke out of the restrained area then took a step forward. The ground collapsed a hole of a meter deep. Zheng jumped up twenty meters high with the force. “Geppo!”</p>
 <p>He changed direction midair. The beam had just reached where he was at this time. The ground on its path was scorched into flat surface. Zheng would probably get crushed if he were to take the attack with his body.</p>
 <p>Zheng landed behind Roste, who was just raising his head. Zheng knew which one was the real one when Roste used the attack. Though to be safe, he sent several Rankyaku at every Roste. The vacuum blade easily sliced across the clones and was blocked by the bell on the real one. The golden color of the bell dimmed even further. The vacuum blade cut in another inch. Roste seemed to be trying to turn around. Only one second had passed.</p>
 <p>“Fist-gun!” Zheng ran up and punched forward. The bell dented in and the punch almost touched Roste’s chest.</p>
 <p>He didn’t pause for a moment. Tiger's Soul slashed wildly and cut inches into the bell every time. Then it finally cut the bell into two from the middle and took an arm along. Roste finally turned his head around. Fear filled his eyes and expression. But Zheng didn’t hold back. A few more slash before Roste could split up again cut off all his limbs. Zheng grabbed Excalibur and put it in the Na ring.</p>
 <p>Six seconds passed in Destruction. Zheng exited from the state. The smaller blood vessels immediately busted and covered him in blood. He quickly checked the Qi and blood energy remaining in his body then drained the ring to prevent himself from falling down.</p>
 <p>“Damn it. The after effect is too heavy. Feels like I am going to die.” He felt pain and itch all over the body. His recovery rate also showed its effect. The blood vessels and muscle strains began healing. Even then, his condition was only at 30% of his best.</p>
 <p>Roste’s speed returned to normal in Zheng’s eyes. He started to yell but all he could do was struggle and roll on the ground without his limbs. He seemed to realize his life was coming to an end so he stopped begging and vented all his pain, anger, and hatred.</p>
 <p>Zheng was worried about Zero. He hadn’t received the notification yet but Zero was going against someone with strong enhancements and a BB defensive item. He picked up Roste then ran toward where the sound of gunshot was coming from. He searched Roste’s body as he ran then found a little golden bell. However, the bell cracked in two from the middle like it was cut by a knife.</p>
 <p>“You won’t f*cking get anything. This item becomes useless as soon as its defense got broken. I have also made a pact with my Excalibur. No one other than me can use it. Haha, your swine. Beating me with so much effort yet not killing me. Are you planning to hand me to the weaklings that can’t get points? You hypocritical weakling!” Roste cursed.</p>
 <p>Zheng didn’t reply and asked. “Where is your storage item? Don’t tell me you don’t have one. I won’t believe it.” He pulled the tendon on Roste’s broken arm. He seemed to hate this man so much.</p>
 <p>Roste gave a shout then calmed down. “I have a storage item with a lot of good items, but why should I give you? And why do you hate me so much? Why? I don’t even know you. Even if I challenged you or said something condescending, can’t you let me go in front of interests? Why! Tell me why do you hate me so much!”</p>
