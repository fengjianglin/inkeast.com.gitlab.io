 <h3>Vol 14 Chapter 28-1</h3>
 <p></p>
 <p>Zheng was fighting for his life. Really fighting for his life. Looking out from his point were swarms and swarms of bodyguard bugs. Tiger's Soul was less useful than a stick, though the light blade could knock the bugs over. His strength and speed in Explosion also surpassed these bugs a lot. He swung the sword multiple times and knocked over a bunch of bugs.</p>
 <p>Zheng ran as fast as he could toward the tunnel. He didn’t dare to use the remaining Destruction time, not even instant Destruction. He had to make full use of every bit of power he had. Any waste and he wouldn’t be able to escape this sea of bugs.</p>
 <p>The sound of explosion came from the tunnel. Zheng looked over to see fire roared the within the tunnel. Shockwave spread out and blasted hundreds of bodyguard bugs flying.</p>
 <p>“Obtained one rank B reward.”</p>
 <p>“Uh… that’s it?”</p>
 <p>This notification was short. There was no mention of completed any bonus missions nor received any points. It was the normal announcement of killing a big monster and only for a rank B reward. He never encountered this form of notification but this wasn’t the time to think. The tunnel was looking to collapse from the explosion. Zheng jumped</p>
 <p>Looking down from above, he saw the bodyguard bugs stopped in place. All of them including the ones blasted away and the ones swarming at Zheng. These bugs didn’t jump up to follow him this time. Zheng used instant Destruction and Geppo then he saw a bodyguard bug bit at the bug next to it. The one that got bit seemed shocked and bit back at the other bug. Neither of them could bite through that black exoskeleton though their actions dragged the bugs nearby into the biting. In just several seconds, all the bugs were biting and tackling each other.</p>
 <p>Zheng glanced over the ground twice then focused on running ahead with Geppo. He soon came to the entrance of the tunnel. The hoppers chasing also started killing each other so they didn’t get to the tunnel before him. Fire was still burning inside but there was no time to be concerned because a lot of rocks had fallen from the explosion. Many more rocks were splintering from the burning. It would be true despair if the whole tunnel was to collapse. He wouldn’t have a way to escape.</p>
 <p>Zheng jumped down then used Soru to move through the tunnel. As soon as he exited the tunnel on the other end, he saw a hole that was ten meters deep and thirty meters wide. He was forced to use Geppo again to jump over. Near the hole was the bear robot holding on to Zero and the two stick humans. It was running with its jet system on.</p>
 <p>The bugs everywhere had gone berserk. They would bite anything they caught onto. The warrior bugs swarmed over several dozen bodyguard bugs but they couldn’t even leave a trace against that exoskeleton. While the bodyguard bugs could tear the warrior bugs apart with their pincers. Even though a bunch of warrior bugs were chasing after the robot, it was still able to run toward where the rest of the team was hiding.</p>
 <p>Zheng flashed over to the bear robot’s back and slashed all those warrior bugs. Then he ran over to the cave where the team was hiding with Soru and yelled. “Faster! Gando!”</p>
 <p>Gando was running with his life at this point. The speed from the jet system wasn’t anything a normal person could handle. He was barely able to use this speed after unlocking in this movie. Its speed was only a little slower than Zheng using Soru. A few seconds later, the robot charged into the cave. Zheng was waiting for this moment. He swung the sword at the ceiling as he backed until a ten-meter big rock fell down. He panted heavily. That was when he realized he didn’t even have the energy to stand. His hand still gripped onto the sword because he couldn’t relax his hand.</p>
 <p>Zheng sat on the ground for several minutes until three people approached him from behind. He turned his head around to see Xuan, Lan, and Snow looking at him.</p>
 <p>Zheng gave a bitter smile. “Almost couldn’t make it. Can’t even move an inch now. How’s everyone? Xuan. How much longer do we have until returning?”</p>
 <p>Xuan looked at his watch calmly and said. “Two hours twenty-seven minutes. Go take a look at Kampa. He’s probably not going to make it.”</p>
 <p>Zheng felt a shock through his heart. He didn’t know where this strength came from, but he jumped up and charged into the cave. In the middle of the cave was the bear robot rolling on the ground. That seemed to be Gando suffering the after effect of unlocking. On a corner was Kampa lying there. Blood soaked his chest. He did seem to be unable to make it through.</p>
 <p>Xuan and the other two also ran over. He still looked calm. “We stopped his bleeding with hemostasis spray but an artery near his heart got cut by metal. He also loss too much blood. Kampa might not be able to make it through the remaining two hours and twenty minutes.”</p>
 <p>Zheng felt anxious. This Russian man was a reliable person. He wasn’t quite like Zero but Zheng knew from learning of his past that Kampa would put his own life forward for comrades that he acknowledged. He was one that could take a bullet for his comrade.</p>
 <p>Zheng said with a heavy voice. “What happened? Metal? The bugs can’t use metal. Is it from another team? That doesn’t seem likely. How can there be people from another team here? Tell me. Who injured him?”</p>
 <p>Xuan waved his hand. “He was not injured by anyone. You should remember that I alerted him of the EMP rifle barrel overheating. The EMP rifle was designed with several second bursts in mind. However, the unlimited ammunition version broke this design and allowed the barrel to overheat too fast. Several hours of nonstop shooting would overheat any gun, not to mention the EMP rifle.”</p>
 <p>Lan also nodded. “Kampa didn’t realize it until the barrel exploded. The metal pieces shot near his heart, then…”</p>
 <p>Zheng sighed. He was overjoyed that they won two team battles in such a difficult movie without casualty. Everyone was going to get over 10k points and at least a rank B reward which would raise their strength by a lot. Yet, someone was going to die at this final moment.</p>
 <p>Zheng exhaled. He walked over to Kampa and observed carefully. There were numerous wounds on Kampa’s chest. Aside from that, his body was turning stiff, his skin turning pale and white. That was a sign of excess blood loss.</p>
 <p>Zheng held Kampa’s wrist then suddenly, he tried to drain the last bit of Qi he had into Kampa’s wrist. The flesh that came in touch with Qi turned hot. Blood moved slowly along with the Qi. It seemed like Qi replicated the function of blood.</p>
 <p>Zheng was overjoyed. He yelled to WangXia. “Disassemble the plasma grenades! Give me the parts that stored Qi!”</p>
