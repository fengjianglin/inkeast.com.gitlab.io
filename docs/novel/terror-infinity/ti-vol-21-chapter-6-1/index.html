<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Zheng activated his Explosion mode, and his battle power sharply rose. Just his speed increased by several folds compared to before. Although it hadn’t reached that ridiculous level of Destruction of breaking the sound barrier, he used this speed to charge towards within a thousand metres of the giant dragon within a short time. Then, his entire body seemed to slam into an invisible wall, with even a “bang” sound produced. Because he had been moving at high speed, he was immediately knocked into confusion.</p>
 <p>“Guest from afar, what is it that prompted you to probe this taboo? Based on your strength, you should know what this taboo represents, right? Return! This is not a place you should be!” The man sitting on the giant black dragon, or accurately speaking king Galbatorix, spoke sternly to the thousand metres away Zheng.</p>
 <p>Zheng didn’t reply. What he was currently most afraid of was to incite the plot, so he might as well ignore King Galbatorix’s questions. He directly extended a hand onto the defensive barrier, pondering how to break through.</p>
 <p>“No need to waste your energy thinking. This is Dragontongue Magic. You’re so powerful, so you should be a Dragon Rider, right? And one with their dragon still alive at that. You should know that my dragon is the Black Dragon, the largest and most powerful dragon. How did you get in without Dragontongue Magic, when your giant dragon isn’t by your side?” King Galbatorix wasn’t angry upon seeing Zheng not speak, instead smiling coldly and continuing to talk.</p>
 <p>(Dragontongue Magic? Speaking of which, the main character could indeed borrow the power of his dragon in the Eragon movie. Using abilities similar to magic, as well as this invisible defensive barrier in front of me. Why does it feel so much like the defensive barrier of the Dragonshard Necklace that guards against high tech weapons?)</p>
 <p>Zheng’s mind moved, and he came up with an idea. Could it be that the Dragon Rider team was actually the human controlling the energy within the giant dragon’s body, with the goal of creating various effects? After all, he had come across an organism like a giant dragon before. Although it was in another movie world, but looking at that body shape and size, there were many similarities with this overwhelmingly large giant dragon before him. If a giant dragon’s ability was only to turn energy into dragonfire and defensive barriers against high technology, giving this energy to a human to use could possibly create various magics and defensive barriers that guarded against all attacks. This was the origin of the Dragon Rider team. Otherwise, with an ordinary human’s weak body, how could they dominate a powerful and large dragon?</p>
 <p>(If so, could our young dragon display this power if it grows big? It’s just that, do we have anyone that can become its Dragon Rider?)</p>
 <p>Zheng considered non stop, but his hands never stopped moving. He punched out repeatedly at that invisible defensive barrier, with every consecutive punch mightier than the last. Later on, each punch had loud booming sounds, like a wrecking ball for demolishing buildings was striking metal.</p>
 <p>Originally, king Galbatorix had had a cold expression watching Zheng strike the defensive barrier. To him, Zheng doing this was undoubtedly very stupid. It could even be described as idiocy. Did he think he could break apart the defensive barrier with a human’s power? But, what happened next exceeded king Galbatorix’s expectations. Was this man truly human? Just from the sound, he didn’t doubt the shockingly destructive power. If it hit an ordinary human, they would definitely turn into bloody gore instantly. Even if it hit the Black Dragon he was sitting on, perhaps even the Black Dragon would feel pain...</p>
 <p>“Hmm, I already know the rough toughness. So, are you ready?”</p>
 <p>Zheng who hadn’t spoken up at all yet suddenly lifted his head, smiling. That smile seemed to be hinting something else, and Galbatorix looked suspiciously at him. Before he recovered from his shock, he suddenly saw Zheng directly unleash one punch on the defensive barrier. That punch actually tore apart the air into shockwaves. Then, the defensive barrier blocking Zheng actually shattered into fragments, and Zheng disappeared on the spot within a flash. When he appeared, he was two hundred metres away from his previous spot. When he disappeared once again, he had covered two hundred metres again before reappearing.</p>
 <p>“Instant Destruction! Fist Gun!”</p>
 <p>“Instant Destruction! Soru!”</p>
 <p>The two moves used consecutively allowed Zheng to easily pass through the barrier. He then rushed over to where Galbatorix and the giant black coloured dragon were. All this happened within the twinkling of an eye. At the same time, the previously listless dragon actually raised its head. It straightforwardly opened its mouth without thinking, and a stream of flame sprayed out. That flame was purely burning white. Its high temperature was obvious just thinking about it. Zheng didn’t dare to be careless, and stomped down forcefully, and more than one meter of flat ground of rocks were stomped into shattering. He leapt to a height of a hundred metres, then used Geppou while in the state of multiple consecutive Instant Destructions. Within a few seconds, Zheng had already rushed to the Black Dragon’s head from over a thousand metres away.</p>
 <p>King Galbatorix finally stood up. He looked both surprised and flustered. When this fellow stood up, he looked majestic and imposing, with a nearly two metre stature filled with muscle, only to see him carrying a three metre long dragon spear pointed at the sky. Through some unknown way, a black aura flowed down from his head, then reached the dragon spear by flowing along his arm. Then, the dragon spear flashed with a black radiance, shooting like lightning towards Zheng in the sky.</p>
 <p>The current Zheng had just used Geppou, and was suspended in midair finding a foothold. In an instant, a sense of danger flashed in his heart. Ever since he had become strong, his sense for danger had become more acute. However, as he got stronger, this feeling hadn’t appeared for a very long time. At once, he took out Tiger’s Soul without thinking and chopped down subconsciously. With a ‘ding’ sound, that dragon spear and Tiger’s Soul had already struck each other.</p>
 <p>When the dragon spear’s black energy was exhausted, it finally dropped from the sky. At the same time, Zheng activated Explosion, but the area between his thumb and index finger was extremely painful. It was obvious that Galbatorix’s power wasn’t inferior to him in Explosion, and was actually even slightly stronger. After all, he had been continuously exerting force while holding Tiger’s Soul, while Galbatorix had merely flung out the dragon spear at high speed.</p>
 <p>(Slightly interesting. This kind of powerful person is guarding here, just to block people from entering ‘hell’? I’ll dispose of him when I come back out… Fortunately, I had the others deal with other tasks just now. If they met this king, perhaps some danger may occur.)</p>
 <p>Zheng looked deeply at Galbatorix. The man had already caught the falling dragon spear, while the dragon also inclined its head to one side, looking at the sky. Right away, Zheng no longer remained, and used Geppou again, shooting like an arrow at the deep hole behind the giant dragon. It was a deep hole without any stairs, with a width of about two hundred metres. Three sides of the wide hole were rock walls, with the last side blocked by the giant dragon. Zheng was currently on the head of the giant dragon, and easily used the midair directional changing ability of Geppou to pass the dragon and king, then disappeared into the giant hole.</p>
 <p>The primordial universe… genesis splitting...</p>
 <p>Within that void, there was no time, no space, no matter. The entire universe was contained within an infinitely small point mass with infinite mass. Then, that point mass blew up, and from that infinite energy began an endless expansion. Time, space and matter… and everything came into being...</p>
 <p>In the vast universe, there were countless planets, countless galaxies and countless worlds. Living things appeared in the boundless starry sky, and with the slow or fast evolution of these living things, intelligent life appeared on these planets. Civilisation arose, and societies appeared...</p>
 <p>Among these countless planets filled with life, a planet that wasn’t too eye-catching called Earth also had countless living things. They too, endlessly evolved, until a lifeform called humans appeared...</p>
 <p>The initial humans were extremely weak, or perhaps to say, they were only a step ahead of monkeys. And among these high level monkeys, a small portion obtained extraordinary evolution due to crisis. They unlocked certain limitations of living things, and after obtaining civilisation and intelligence, these evolved individuals named this method of evolution as unlocking the genetic constraint. A few of outstanding talent called themselves Saints. Because they had unlocked the fifth stage of the genetic constraint, they stood at the apex of all lifeforms.</p>
 <p>From the initial bloody path carved out of countless monsters, humanity of that time already possessed an extremely advanced civilisation. They had even flown out of Earth, and even had a few bases on Mars. Humanity’s future looked bright, and at this time, a few rebels appeared among humanity itself. They didn’t respect the Saint’s path of the genetic constraint, but instead searched for a different method. Using runes and cultivation type technologies, these people used these technologies to obtain the power to battle Saints. While perhaps they may not able to challenge Saints individually, their strength was different from Saints. Saints could not teach their strength to others, and the genetic constraint was one’s personal power. However, these people could pass on their inheritance through knowledge, and thus this organisation’s power became greater and greater, until the stage they could threaten the traditions of the Saints. They were called… Cultivators!</p>
 <p>War! Cultivators and Saints warred as their ‘Daos’ differed. Both sides were convinced that their path of evolution was absolutely correct, and hoped to pass on their ‘Dao’ of evolution to humanity. Due to this conviction, these two organisations with exceedingly great power actually didn’t explore the rest of the cosmos, but instead began a war. This war was known as the Grand Primordial War!</p>
