 <p>Note: Jk again guys, the previous chapter was real... The DnD is real lol</p>
 <p>It had to be known that Zheng’s current strength was practically 15000 kilograms of force. Even a simple punch wouldn’t be much less powerful than the explosion of a hand grenade. It was because of this strength that it wasn’t necessary for him to pursue any kind of technique, and it was sufficient to just purely use force to break through technique. Although he hadn’t yet used Explosion, this Black Knight wasn’t actually the slightest bit harmed under this punch. The strength of this organism was sufficient to brag about. They were stronger than the elite orc soldiers in Lord of the Rings that could use battle Qi. Rather, they should be two to three times stronger.</p>
 <p>(It’s still fine for me. If it’s Heng and the rest, then they could possibly really be in danger if they get pincered by them, especially in a tunnel like this. It looks like the power levels of Eragon aren’t as weak as it looks externally.)</p>
 <p>Zheng pondered back and forth, but his hands didn't stop moving. The punch before had been ineffectual, so he intentionally increased his force, and even slightly activated his Qi. Every punch and kick caused thunderous booms and when his leg stomped down, the ground would crack open. Then, the helmet of the Black Knight in front of him flew off. Zheng had easily struck this Black Knight with speed difficult to follow with the eyes. However, what surprised him was that there was actually no fleshy body under the helmet. Accurately speaking, this Black Knight was merely a suit of armour. It was no wonder that nothing had happened when he had punched out, when what was fighting him was just a suit of armour.</p>
 <p>“Hoho, so it was like this. This is troublesome to handle…”</p>
 <p>Several minutes later, only a large pile of crushed metal pancakes were left in the passageway, with even the two-handed heavy swords and armours crushed together into those pancakes. The Black Knights were no longer able to move.</p>
 <p>Although the Black Knights were unable to hurt or even block Zheng, their numbers in the third underground floor were simply too many. On the way, Zheng had been pestered nonstop by these Black Knights. He had already crushed a hundred metal pancakes, and still wasn’t done yet. It seemed like the Black Knights on this floor were inexhaustible, becoming especially dense when he headed in a certain direction.</p>
 <p>Just like that, Zheng wasted tens of minutes before he was no longer able to bear with this turtle-like speed. Before, he had been careful to conserve his Qi and Blood Energy so as to avoid any powerful beings that may be below. He finally began to use Explosion, seeming to become a whirlwind. All that could be seen was a person flashing by, and all the Black Knights in the passageway would be sent crashing in all directions towards the walls. They were all deeply embedded in the rock and were unable to come out no matter how they struggled. Zheng on the other hand, charged forward nonchalantly. Only when he reached a bright area did he stop Explosion.</p>
 <p>This was a place with rarely seen light in the third underground floor. Although the other areas had torches inserted at the walls, they were still dim and had a ghastly feeling. Only this place suddenly let out a sunlight-like lighting. It was a room that wasn’t too eye-catching. The door area was densely packed with magic runes written there, which were what was producing that light.</p>
 <p>“Are these magical things? I don’t know if I can obtain what’s here. How interesting, I didn't think we would be able to obtain these extra things in Eragon. Right, perhaps the documents exposing the truth left behind by Saints and Cultivators are among these, like that will left behind by that Saint, Anubis.”</p>
 <p>Zheng was talking to himself. The more he thought about it, the more excited he was. At once, he raised his legs to walk to that room. &nbsp;But right when he walked to the area of magic runes, he ran into an invisible defensive barrier. Zheng didn’t dare to use brute force. After all, this defensive barrier may not solely be defensive. Wouldn’t forcefully breaking it apart destroy the whole room if it had offensive properties? Just the elf princess Arya lying inside made him not dare to act recklessly.</p>
 <p>“Doraemon, I found something interesting. How about it? Want to come down and take a look? You’ve researched Cultivation techniques, as well as information left behind by Saints and Cultivators for so long, so you should be able to solve these magic runes, right?” Zheng thought about it, before taking out the silver coloured metal piece to contact Xuan.</p>
 <p>Xuan directly said, “I saw it long ago. Not bad, there are magical mechanisms. I’ll be making a trip down.”</p>
 <p>“Xuan! You can’t possibly be using this metal piece to keep surveilling us, right? Dammit, why can’t our metal pieces do that?” Zheng immediately started scolding. He suddenly remembered how during The Grudge movie, Xuan had made a type of communication device for them. However, Xuan’s had been the main device, which could listen in on the conversations between the other devices.</p>
 <p>Xuan spoke as if nothing had happened. “It’s not the silver coloured metal piece. I made the same for all of us. It’s something else.” While speaking, an electrical light suddenly flashed faintly in Xuan’s right eye. If closely inspected, one would notice a grotesquely shaped rune image in his eye, with an eighty to ninety percent similarity to the script in the Cultivation techniques from the documents in his hand.</p>
 <p>“Forget it, I don’t care exactly what you did. You’ve never told us anything before anyways… Right, since you can see me, can you see the situation down below? Help me see what’s downstairs.” Zheng sighed. He was too lazy to get mad at that fellow Xuan, so he might as well make his request.</p>
 <p>Xuan didn’t say anymore. The rune image in his right eye began to operate. To his right eye, the entire world became one of only energy. For example, the Sky Stick beneath his feet possesed energy that was obviously more than that of the surroundings, while his own body’s energy was not just a hundred folds that of the Sky Stick. The ground was dotted with densely packed energy clumps, each symbolising a living thing. Among them, there were several thousand in the capital area that were obviously several times greater than those in the surrounding villages. Imhotep and Yingkong’s energy clumps were as obviously radiant as the moon among these densely packed energy clumps.</p>
 <p>When he looked further down, the energy clump that represented Zheng was like the sun. Even using the naked eye to look would end up making the eye feel like it was swelling up. That strength was the sole existence that surpassed Xuan amongst all the living things. He was indeed very very strong...</p>
 <p>“...There are a total of five floors. King Galbatorix is on the floor below. That’s right, there’s a big dragon next to him... The passageway down is behind the dragon and him. The fifth floor space… I can’t see anything…” While speaking, Xuan allowed his right eye to return to normal. When he finished speaking, he immediately began to pant.</p>
 <p>Zheng didn’t know Xuan’s condition. He only silently considered for a moment, before saying, “Then I’ll leave the magic runes on the third floor to you. I’ll go and explore the fifth floor. I’m paying a lot of attention to that rumour about ‘hell’. Need me to deal with king Galbatorix on the way?”</p>
 <p>Xuan panted for a moment, before indifferently replying, “No need. Try your best not to harm the dragon or him. One, Arya hasn’t been rescued yet, so we haven't determined if there’s a side quest. Two, the room on the third floor would likely be destroyed by your battle. So, it’ll be best not to harm him when entering the fifth floor.”</p>
 <p>“The difficulty is pretty high,” Zheng smiled bitterly. “Fine, we’ll do it like this. I’ll go and meet king Galbatorix, and see how strong this BOSS that never appeared in the movie is. I’ll also go do some sightseeing in hell at the same time!”</p>
 <p>“... Remember to bring some special products of hell back.”</p>
 <p>With these words from Xuan, Zheng walked down the fourth underground floor with some anger. He was still thinking about exactly what kind of method Xuan was using to see through. Could it be there was something similar to a tracking device installed on him? While thinking, he had already walked down the stairs to the fourth floor.</p>
 <p>Just as Zheng reached the fourth floor, the gloomy air before suddenly disappeared, and suddenly turned into a fiery hot aura. It was just like standing at an entrance of magma to a volcano. This third and fourth floor were completely different from the previous three. It no longer had passageways and rooms. This place was purely a natural underground cavern. It looked incomparably spacious, and Zheng actually couldn’t see the end. In terms of space, this layer’s size should be equivalent to the entire area the mountain range above took up.</p>
 <p>“How ridiculous… Still, what’s more ridiculous is that Xuan, you idiot, this dragon is just a ‘big dragon’?”</p>
 <p>Zheng felt so hateful that his gums were aching. The dragon in front of his eyes was what was truly a ‘giant’ dragon. How big was it? Using that human on it as a comparison, this giant dragon was about a hundred metres long, and would be forty plus metres standing up. Its two wings extended would be over a hundred meters in width. This giant dragon’s size even surpassed the one Zheng had met before in Jurassic Park, and was bigger and more powerful than the young dragon he brought even in its matured state.</p>
 <p>“Hmm, I called it a big dragon, because it’s only physically big. In terms of an energy, ten of those can’t equal you. So, no need to worry.” Xuan said indifferently.</p>
 <p>“What nonsense is it that I don’t need to worry? Dammit, the passageway is BEHIND that giant dragon! How do you want me to enter the fifth floor?” Zheng practically roared in rage.</p>
 <p>“Hmm… That’s your problem.”</p>
 <p>“But I can’t come up with any way, which is why I’m asking you!”</p>
 <p>“How is that my problem…”</p>
 <p>“Wait for me to get out. I will DEFINITELY break all your teeth!” Zheng was more or less gnashing his teeth as he shouted at the silver coloured metal piece. He then looked at the distance. There was flat ground there, where an outrageously large black dragon was lying down. A middle-aged man was sitting on top of the dragon.</p>
 <p>“Then, let me test out your combat power!”</p>
 <p>Zheng didn’t dare to be careless, so he immediately activated Explosion. His figure turned into a blur, and he charged at the giant black dragon at an extreme speed.</p>
