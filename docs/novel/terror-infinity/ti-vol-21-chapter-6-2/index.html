<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>A difficult to describe state of being half dreaming and half awake. Zheng didn’t know many metres he had fallen. When he recovered, he wasn't even two hundred metres away from the ground. His speed was shocking and even his strong body wouldn’t be able to bear this terrifying impact force at this rate of descent.</p>
 <p>Zheng merely looked down, and cold sweat began to flow on his entire body. His genetic constraint unlocked automatically instantaneously and his body’s instincts acted faster than his mind. A Geppou was used at once, but his speed was too fast, and he already crossed another hundred metres in a moment. A single Geppou simply was unable to decrease much falling velocity.</p>
 <p>Zheng didn’t care about much else. Destruction was activated at once, and both legs executed Geppou nonstop at speeds that couldn’t be caught with the naked eye. At the same time, he took out Tiger’s Soul and aimed at the ground. At the same time as his speed decreased continuously, his distance from the ground was less than ten metres. Zheng poured all his power into Tiger’s Soul, and hurled the sabre downwards. A violent explosion rang out and Tiger’s Soul blew apart a giant crater at the ground. Using the updraft that rushed upwards, Zheng finally lowered his speed to something bearable. A lonely “bang” sound rang out again, and Zheng landed in this crater.</p>
 <p>Although Zheng had tried his best to stop his fall, he had still fallen miserably. His entire back hurt, and all his skin and flesh had been torn open. It was all thanks to his body being incomparably strong. A normal person would have long since fallen to their death, and he was only in pain but unharmed.</p>
 <p>“Dammit, isn’t this giving people a hard time? As soon as we enter this hole we’re hypnotised, and some things are told using God’s voice. But all this was already deduced by that fellow Xuan. What about the rest? Where’s the most important part, the rest! Damn!” Zheng leapt up from the ground. He ignored the pain in his back, and immediately began to roar abuse. It was unknown whom he was scolding.</p>
 <p>It turned out that when he first dropped into this hole, it was like when he entered a movie world from God’s Realm. Everything was hazy, and it was both like being in a dream and being awake. He had heard God’s monotonous voice narrate those things, starting from the genesis splitting of Chaos that established Heaven and Earth. It had spoken of the origin of Saints and Cultivators, then the great war between them. It had practically ruined the ecological environment of Earth, and made the dinosaurs extinct. The vast majority of humanity perished. The surviving Saints and Cultivators created humans once again, and used the stored genes left behind by past humans to undergo large-scale reproduction. Humanity recovered from the brink of extermination, but that was after a long time passed.</p>
 <p>However, in the great war between Cultivators and Saints, seventy percent of them died. But war deserved to be called the number one impetus for human evolution. The great war allowed both sides to slightly acknowledge the other side’s ‘Dao’, as well as what the other pursued in regards to evolution. The intelligent ones among the two sides believed that when the two sides joined their power, humanity would evolve to the peak, or perhaps the peak of this universe. At that time, there would be nothing humanity couldn’t use, whether space, time, matter or energy. The fundamental nature of the universe was its sheer enormity, but it would all become humanity’s playground. That was what both sides believed to be the peak of their path of evolution, whether the sixth stage of the genetic constraint Saints hypothesized there was or the Golden Immortal of the Great Firmament that Cultivators imagined.</p>
 <p>Their ‘Dao’ was different, and their understanding towards the ultimate power was different. However, due to the Grand Primordial War that had practically shattered the Heavens and Earth, although they wouldn’t have dealings with each other, they wouldn’t battle again. That was until they all had a decisive discovery about the necessary power. At that time, they discovered...</p>
 <p>“Dammit, what did they discover? If you want to leave a message, leave it all in one go! Don’t be like that fellow Xuan and stop halfway! Doing things like this is just asking to be beaten up!” Zheng’s heart was like it was being clawed at by a cat. Now, he just wanted to know what they discovered. What made the Saints and Cultivators work together, and ignore the differences in their ‘Dao’? What made them build God’s Realm? What made them so afraid, that they left behind all these last words?</p>
 <p>The power of Saints and Cultivators. Although this was only a segment of last words with no pictures, Zheng clearly understood how strong they were. One had a nigh infinite usage of energy and energy manipulation that was clearly a power that only gods could have.The other side reached a level of technology that surpassed modern technology by a thousand years or even more, such as high technology, rune technology and those countless miraculous Cultivation techniques and creations. Ignoring other things, when Xuan only slightly used the ancient bell, he could actually manipulate space and time for a short while. This ability exceeded even that of gods!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>What kind of existence could terrify Saints and Cultivators so? Aliens? Impossible! Even if ten thousand motherships from Independence Day appeared, Saints and Cultivators could butcher them relaxedly. Could it be like what Xuan hypothesized? We are in a box, and they know how to escape the box?</p>
 <p>“Mhm, that conjecture isn’t bad.” Xuan’s voice was suddenly transmitted, although he sounded weak.</p>
 <p>“Damn, I just knew you must have definitely put some ability in the silver coloured metal pieces to peek into our heads. Dammit, playing this trick in secret again… How are you? Why does your voice sound so weak? “ Zheng took out the metal piece to shout at it, and suddenly went from shouting to asking curiously.</p>
 <p>Xuan was currently standing at the passageway in the third underground floor. He was surrounded by armours riddled with bullet holes, and the bullet holes were leaking black aura. Xuan’s Gauss pistols were using spiritual bullets, and could naturally subdue these Black Knights. Shockingly, one of his arms had been cut off from the shoulder. That severed arm was lying at his feet, and the Black Knight who had sliced off his hand had already been struck down by Gauss bullets.</p>
 <p>“Since you entered the hole, I’ve been paying attention to over there. I didn’t expect that hypnosis to spread to even me. Although I got to hear the last message, the price of having my mind wander during battle is an arm.” Xuan indifferently rubbed the cut shoulder, and although the bleeding had been staunched, that wound and severed arm on the ground looked hideously horrifying.</p>
 <p>Zheng didn’t say anything more. He still had a lot of faith in Xuan’s battle prowess. At least in this world, he wouldn’t meet any danger. His heart slightly determined, he turned around to look at his surroundings.</p>
 <p>Only now did Zheng have a clear view of the surroundings. His shock couldn’t be put into words, as how was this the fifth floor? This was obviously another world. There was a blood coloured sky with three blood coloured suns radiating light. The ground was a field of blood red, and the world seemed to be permeated with a bloody ferocious aura at first glance. At some unknown height, the top of the sky had a black hole. Earthen walls could be faintly made out within the pitch black hole. However, why would that hole strangely appear there?</p>
 <p>“This world looks a little too strange, doesn't it?” Zheng considered, then took the Sky Stick out from the Na Ring. He stepped on the Sky Stick and soared into the sky. When he flew to a height of a thousand metres and looked down, he saw a vast blood coloured earth with no end in sight.</p>
 <p>“Is it an illusion? Xuan, could you help me take a look at the situation here?” Zheng was in a slight daze seeing this, and immediately spoke to the silver coloured metal plate.</p>
 <p>“Who do you think I am? I can see it just because I want to?” Xuan sighed with some helplessness. “This thing needs large amounts of energy to activate. I can only use the power of faith of the Lambda Driver to activate it, but power of faith itself isn’t inexhaustible. Also, down there where you are is pretty strange. I can only see the passageway leading to the fifth floor, but I can’t see anything at the fifth floor space. Anyways, search properly yourself down there, and remember your location. Don’t be unable to find your way back when the time comes.”</p>
 <p>Zheng made a few mhm sounds. He didn’t continue to speak, but instead used the Sky Stick to continue flying. The hole in the sky was there anyways, and looked like black moonlight. It was extremely obvious, encircled by three blood coloured suns. As long as he didn’t go too far away from the hole, it was difficult to be lost even if he wanted to.</p>
 <p>Zheng flew around for a while. This region was vast without end. He flew for a short while and didn’t even come across a single living thing. However, he discovered another giant hole not far from the hole in the sky, which was even bigger. It appeared as an irregular circle, with a diameter of at least a few kilometres. It was pitch black and deep, with an unknown depth.</p>
 <p>“What is this? This floor is equivalent to a world, vast and without end. I don’t know how long it would take to completely explore it. We only have three days to return to God’s Realm before points are deducted. Dammit, what is this supposed to mean? Another hole for me to jump into appeared! Only an idiot would jump in, dammit!” Zheng remembered that thrilling moment before where he almost fallen to his death, and immediately started cursing.</p>
 <p>“Hmm… is this Eragon?” Just as Zheng was angrily scolding, Xuan suddenly interjected with this unrelated line, which made Zheng go blank. After a long time, Zheng unhappily said, “Of course it’s Eragon. Could your head be dizzy now?”</p>
 <p>“... It can also be considered that this world is under the rules of Dungeons and Dragons, or something close to it. These rules are interesting. It’s practically using rules to make a fabricated world. In this world of rules, there’s a place that suits the environment you’re at. Hmm, it’s called the Infinite Layers of the Abyss. The organisms inside are called demons. The Nine Hells of Baator also seem to be a part of the Abyss, only that it’s a special part of it.” Xuan ignored Zheng, and started talking to himself.</p>
 <p>Zheng’s head was even more blank, and he asked curiously, “What does that mean? Why did you suddenly bring up Dungeons and Dragons?”</p>
 <p>“Because I’ve roughly guessed what they're thinking…” Xuan used his remaining hand to push up his spectacles. “If I haven't guessed wrongly, they’re already informing us of something. It’s just that they can’t say it out.”</p>
