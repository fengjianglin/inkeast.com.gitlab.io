 <p>That was what Xuan said but the others felt he was intentional. It felt like he knew this would happen then had the leader step into this danger.</p>
 <p>YinKong nodded without saying anything. She turned around and ran toward the exit. She appeared calm but there was a hint of anxiousness in her eyes. They could tell she actually worried about Zheng.</p>
 <p>Xuan didn’t stop her. He flipped through the documents. “We have enough time to leave here. We have obtained our item and reward for the bonus mission. That’s it then. Mission obtain the prototype T virus successfully completed.” He ignored the weird expressions from the others and started walking away.</p>
 <p>After Xuan got ten meters away, ChengXiao said to the rest of the team in a quiet voice. “Did something happen before I was revived? Is he trying to kill Zheng? You really can’t irritate this psychopath. He just kills you if he catches you and you don’t even know how you died. Yes, don’t ever irritate him. And did Zheng really do something to him?”</p>
 <p>Kampa patted his shoulder and said. “It might be a misperception but don’t you think what you just said annoyed him?”</p>
 <p>ChengXiao suddenly looked shocked. He carefully glanced at Xuan and saw him still reading the documents like nothing had happened. ChengXiao let out a sigh of relief. “Be careful of what you say. This is a man with a demon hidden within. He looks like he never cared but he will eat you in whole when he starts calculating. Anyone that talks behind his back needs to be careful. Or you might be the next one to get abandoned.”</p>
 <p>“Talking behind him? Just like what you are doing?” WangXia walked past ChengXiao and casually asked.</p>
 <p>“Eh?”</p>
 <p>Enough about ChengXiao seeking death. YinKong was running to the research facility anxiously. She wasn’t good at communicating herself but she was really worried about Zheng. She didn’t want to see him die. She wasn’t aware when did it start that she had acknowledged these people around her, even though they were weaklings when judged on the standards of her seniors, comrades and ZuiKong. These people were weak in both strength and willpower. They were people that could be abandoned at will. Yet she had acknowledged them as comrades.</p>
 <p>ZuiKong killed all her the people she trusted. She didn’t want to give up on any of these comrades she had now. This emotion was not in accordance with the way of assassination. However, she wished to protect them.</p>
 <p>The corridor leading to the exit was quiet. Team China had cleared all the defensive machineries and guards. She easily came out of the center in just two minutes. Then she ran toward the research facility in full speed. She noticed fires burning in everywhere. There were remains of several armed helicopters burning on the ground. A fighter jet was speeding through the sky and a dozen armed helicopters followed behind it.</p>
 <p>YinKong didn’t stop to watch this intense fight as she continued toward the facility. Half way there, she heard a loud bang. One of the helicopters that was firing missiles shattered into pieces. It then exploded in midair.</p>
 <p>Zero moaned as he held his head in his hands. Lan quickly asked. “What happened? Why was that helicopter shattered with a shot? Are you alright?”</p>
 <p>Zero shook his head. “It’s fine, just a little headache. The success rate of the Mystic Eyes is too low. You can only see half a second and the points and lines move extremely fast in that half second. This is my fourth shot already. It’s impossible to hit a moving dot. I have to rely on the speed of the Gauss sniper rifle to hit the lines. There’s less than a 25% chance I can use the power of the eyes successfully.”</p>
 <p>Lan didn’t understand the situation regarding the Mystic Eyes but she believed what Zero said. She suddenly saw Zero bleeding blood from his eyes, nose, mouth and ears and panicked. “Zero, you all right? Say something!”</p>
 <p>Zero wiped the blood that dripped down from his eyes and smiled bitterly. “The Mystic Eyes put too much strain on my body. I can’t see anything now. I probably won’t die but I have to exit the unlocked mode now. The pain is going to knock me unconscious.” His body started convulsing.</p>
 <p>Zero’s last shot was spectacular but YinKong wasn’t in the mood to watch the firework. She counted down the time in her mind. And she had entered the unlocked mode. Numerous guards were running out from the facility and screaming with fear. Some of these guards had missing arms and legs.</p>
 <p>YinKong ignored them. She still had her dragonshard with full energy. Her Excalibur didn’t have the laser ability but its sharpness was impressive by itself. Its invisibility attribute allowed her to kill people without traces. She stopped hiding herself and charged straight ahead. The guards didn’t bother her. They kept running as if they had seen a ghost. Neither side bothered the others. YinKong counted four minutes and thirty-seven seconds. She entered a big lobby and a pungent smell of blood struck her sense.</p>
 <p>There were no living humans in this room. Two seven meter big Lickers hung on the ceiling. Tentacles grown on their bodies made them look like octopuses. Their hideous appearance gave her a shock. What was more shocking were the pressure and sense of danger these creatures imposed on her. She tensed up herself as her instinct was telling her she could die from these two monsters.</p>
 <p>One of the Lickers jumped down from the ceiling. YinKong immediately rolled toward a corridor to the side. The claws swiped into the metallic floor then pulled a layer up like it was a piece of paper. The Licker pulled off several meters of the floor. The other one also jumped down and leaped at YinKong.</p>
 <p>The strength and speed of these Lickers were terrifying. YinKong could only rely on the sharpness of Excalibur. Her close range assassination techniques were nearly useless against these huge monsters and the lobby was spacious. If only she still had the metal wire she could use in long range.</p>
 <p>Experience told her there was no way to live if she fought both Lickers unless she found terrain suitable for assassination. Worse yet, these Lickers didn’t seem to see with their eyes. If they sensed people with smell or temperature, her sneak techniques would be useless. She flipped herself up from the floor and ran into the corridor.</p>
 <p>YinKong didn’t turn her head once. She could move faster than these Lickers but such speed also robbed her of the ability to do anything else but run. Yet, the further she went, the more that she felt despair. Because the smell of blood was getting even more intense ahead. So intense that it could make a person suffocate. The place ahead seemed like a slaughter ground. Were there even more Lickers?</p>
 <p>YinKong took a deep breath. She didn’t stop her steps. She raised Excalibur as she made a turn. The area ahead was much brighter. It was a huge lobby and there, she saw Zheng. Zheng stood on top of countless human and Licker corpses. He was holding a Licker’s head in his left hand. His right hand was holding Tiger's Soul. The sword pierced through a Licker then into the wall. There were at least a hundred Licker corpses in this room.</p>
