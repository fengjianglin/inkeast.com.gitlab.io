<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Lionheart smiled with elegance. "I know of you. Zheng Zha, the leader of team China and team Devil. You and your clone are both incredible people. Based on what I know, your clone is acknowledged as the strongest person in the realm by multiple teams. And you are not far off for edging over team Celestial. Your potentials are extraordinary."</p>
 <p>Zheng paused for a moment before he spoke. "It seems like you are familiar with me. I don't know you."</p>
 <p>Lionheart bowed. "You wouldn't know a side character like me. I am nothing more than a nobody who struggles to survive in this realm. Someone who wishes to slowly grow and avoid anyone powerful. If it isn't for the final hour coming near, I wouldn't have taken the leader position. Hehe. The good old days when you won't be put into a team battle without a leader. Now, team battles are forced upon you whether the team has a leader or not. I dislike this."</p>
 <p>Zheng had entered the third stage the moment Lionheart appeared and emulated HongLu's thinking process. The chance of obtaining useful information from this man was slim but people on the level of HongLu could make great use of even the vaguest information. Xuan on the other hand was on a non-human level.</p>
 <p>"You mean… the last time, or in an earlier team battle, the other team gave you information of me and my clone? Someone that knows us well… Neos? No. A smart person like Neos wouldn't be oblivious of the meaning of the final battle. He wouldn't leak our team's information given our relationship, unless you had the upper hand and forced him to trade it with the team's survival. Yet, I don't see that you have the strength to put him in those circumstances. He's someone only slightly below Xuan. That means you encountered team Celestial, am I right?" Zheng said as though he was speaking with himself. His eyes fixed on Lionheart with a sharp gaze.</p>
 <p>Lionheart was surprised. He laughed and said. "Your guesses are accurate. Indeed, we met one of the two strongest teams after battling an unknown team. We were the mice under the claws of the cat in that movie. We almost died for their amusement. We were lucky a civil war broke out in their team. They eventually came to terms but we managed to escape death with the opportunity. Team Celestial's leader knew it became impossible to wipe our team and decided to negotiate in the end. We paid an expensive price for a fraction of the information they possessed about this realm."</p>
 <p>Zheng continued talking to himself. "Team Celestial. Adam is more intelligent than Neos. He wouldn't do anything pointless. Why did he give you the information about me and my clone? I can only guess you are related to us… Yet, I don't know you. So, it must be my clone who knows you. And the two of you are bonded by animosity… I get it. Your clone joined team Devil. He joined before my clone. Is it? My clone is searching for you in the realm because he wants to kill you!"</p>
 <p>The elegance faded from Lionheart's face. A wicked expression took its place but the elegance quickly returned. He laughed in a low volume and said. "That's beside the point for today. I am not here to discuss who I am. Since you are team China's leader, let's talk about what we will be up against."</p>
 <p>"Beside the point?" Zheng chuckled coldly. He lowered his head and twirled the hair on his forehead. "Okay. Let's treat it as beside the point. What are you planning to do? Taking the risk to meet me before a team battle begins. You can't be here to establish a connection."</p>
 <p>"Risk?" Lionheart rubbed his nose and gave off a cheerful laughter. "I don't feel there's any danger meeting you. Did you switch the positions we are in? The one in danger should be you, especially when you are standing under the dish and your teammates aren't with you. Team China doesn't even have a psyche force user. Haha."</p>
 <p>"Are you retarded?" Zheng calmly looked at him. "Bring your whole team if you want to fight me and please use the weapons on the fortress. Or else… do you want to die?"</p>
 <p>Lionheart was dumbfounded for a few seconds before he laughed out. "I am not bothering to debate with you. Not like I am here with mal-intent anyway. What do you think of an alliance with us, us and several other teams? For the final battle and to fight against team Devil which is growing with madness every day. Team Celestial is communicating with every team. Once a team's strength is verified, they will be able to join the Angel Alliance. You still don't know what your clone did right? He's gone insane…"</p>
 <p>Through Lionheart's narration, Zheng learned that his clone invented a method to control any person who hadn't reached the fourth stage at the mental level.</p>
 <p>"The control he instills is permanent. One couldn't reverse the change that happened even after reaching the fourth stage. What a terrifying man he is. He's not seeking for the victory anymore. He desires to control all the teams in order to control this realm. Body control is nothing when he controls the soul!" Lionheart said in an agitated tone while looking at Zheng. However, Zheng didn't show any unnecessary emotion. It felt as though he deemed what his clone was doing as normal.</p>
 <p>Lionheart paused for a moment before continuing. "What do you mean by this? Are you going to let his insanity continue?"</p>
 <p>Zheng gave a cold laughter. "Insanity? Why does insanity exists? Damn your insanity. You speak as though you are justice. Do you think I don't know what kind of people you are? How many in team Celestial are actually acting with good will? As for you… if I am not wrong, you enslave your team like cattle to feed you points and rewards. You kill them to keep your team rating low while your strength become disproportionately strong. You are probably among the people who are selected into team Devil. And my clone killed your clone."</p>
 <p>Lionheart laughed and clapped his hands. "Impressive. This ability to think of so much in such a short amount of time puts me to shame. You're correct. I was cloned into team Devil and your clone killed him. Your clones issued an order to all the teams under his control, an order for arrest that included all the people he will kill. Any team that killed these people will be rewarded or even freed once he confirmed it. Don't feel happy yet. I am not the only one on there. You and your whole team are on the order. Your clone has decided to kill you. Haha. Are you sure you can ignore it?"</p>
 <p>Zheng shook his head. "I can't. But that does not have anything to do with you! I won't trust this Angel Alliance. Instead of taking a stab on the back, I'd rather put my life on the bet to fight my clone! If I die, it will be a blissful death compared to being framed and backstabbed and die in grief! Clean your neck and prepare yourselves in this movie. Team China will surpass team Celestial and team Devil. We are the strongest team in this realm!"</p>
 <p>Lionheart chuckled. He leaned his body slightly in a bow and said. "Since you have decided to ignore our wish for peace, we have the responsibility as a member of the Angel Alliance to eradicate the potential threat that is team China. You can't come to the sky and we can't come down before the fire begins. This conversation is the limit we can achieve at this time. Farewell then. I believe you can show me the prowess of your clone the next time we meet. Or at least a fraction of his strength. Haha."</p>
 <p>The hologram figure faded in his laughter. The dish that was floating a hundred meters above the ground rose and flew into the sky fortress. Zheng finally relaxed the grip on Tiger's Soul. He had the urge to attack the dish when it was close to the ground and would have attacked if Lionheart didn't mention they couldn't come to the sky.</p>
 <p>(Why didn't we get this message? Is the leader the only person capable of receiving it? Or is it a limitation only placed on team Pacific to limit their influence advantage? Damn it. Seeing a trash and can't attack… Just wait. Wait for Xuan to come.)</p>
 <p>While Zheng pondered, he didn't notice the civilians and cops were shocked. Politicians ran out from the White House and all looked at him.</p>
