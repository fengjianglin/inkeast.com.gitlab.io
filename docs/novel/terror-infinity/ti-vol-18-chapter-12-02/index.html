<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Heng’s appearance was so sudden and his shout drew everyone's attention. TengYi’s mind froze for a moment when he saw Heng, like he was asking who was this man? That only lasted for two seconds before something struck his mind and he yelled, “Heng! You are Heng! Help me! Hurry!”</p>
 <p>Heng was confused at TengYi’s words. Why did this TengYi seem like they didn’t know each other? Or that he had just remembered him? But there was no time to ponder because the dragonshard barrier only blocked attacks from technological weapons and not Freddy’s gloved hand. Heng saw Freddy reaching out his glove to kill TengYi. Only a few steps’ distance separated the two. Those scissors would pierce into TengYi’s back in at most two seconds.</p>
 <p>“Fuck you!” Heng yelled.</p>
 <p>Light radiated from Heng’s hands and reflected off the silver bow. The +4 enchanted arrow transformed into a strand of light. Time seemed to have stopped at this instant. The only object that moved was the strand of light which flashed across and pierced Freddy from the left to right shoulder. His body began to disintegrate at the wound and soon, Freddy disappeared among the wind as particles. The light continued to penetrate into a building far in the distance and crushed its wall.</p>
 <p>The flow of time returned. The remains of Freddy’s clothes finally began to fall from air.</p>
 <p>This shot could rival Zero’s snipe through the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception. It did not have the unique characteristic of ignoring defense but ordinary defenses were no match for this shot. Its speed, accuracy and power put the shot among the top-tier abilities.</p>
 <p>“Lightning Shot!” The upgrade of the elven bloodline transformed Charged Shot into Lightning Shot. It indeed seemed like Heng released a bolt of lightning. Perhaps due to Heng’s ascension in the soul, he did not collapse after firing. He placed two arrows on the bow and aimed them at Xuan.</p>
 <p>“TengYi!” Heng yelled, his eyes fixed on Xuan. “What happened? Why are Xuan and Freddy chasing you?”</p>
 <p>TengYi was panting heavily. Xuan stopped in place after Heng fire that shot. He crossed the Gauss pistols in front of his body and stopped moving. Seeing Xuan stopped attacking, TengYi ran into a shop and yelled, “Heng! This Xuan is fake. Freddy would not drag the real Xuan into this dream world. Zheng attempted to attack Xuan but he disappeared… Freddy also said the heavier Zheng’s break down, the stronger Xuan becomes. Hurry up and attack him!”</p>
 <p>Heng hesitated. He wasn’t sure if he should believe TengYi. Even though Xuan attacked TengYi along with Freddy, who knew if this was his scheme? Heng had worked with Xuan long enough that he believed if there was someone who could turn Freddy into a teammate, it was Xuan.</p>
 <p>Xuan did not give Heng the time to think. He slowly aimed the pistols at TengYi and Heng. Then his hands rotated in an extremely fast speed. The Gauss bullets struck two translucent barriers. Xuan’s speed and accuracy had increased greatly. This form was more than simply shooting. It was the form of gun-kata that Xuan created.</p>
 <p>The bullets drown out the two people’s thoughts. Heng’s dragonshard was still at full energy. But not so for TengYi. He slipped into another shop and yelled, “Heng! What should we do? The gap in Zheng’s heart is widening. Xuan’s going to use Lambda Driver if it continues.”</p>
 <p>Heng felt a shiver within. He had witnessed Xuan use gun-kata and Lambda Driver in training and he also heard Zheng describe Xuan’s showcasing in Transformers. Someone who could kill his way through powerful robots could slaughter him and TengYi in an instant. Without hesitation, Heng fired the two arrow explosive shot at Xuan.</p>
 <p>Xuan’s eyes had defocused. It was an obvious sign of entering the unlocked mode. Just as the two arrows neared each other, the Gauss pistol bullets struck the arrows. Pah-pah. The arrows shattered before they collided.</p>
 <p>The strength of gun-kata lay in creating a circular zone surrounding the user. Xuan had calculated every possible trajectory of attacks. As long as his hands continued moving, all attacks would be stopped by the Gauss pistol bullets. The only exception was when those attacks were much more powerful than the bullets or were immune. Everything else would be shot down before reaching Xuan.</p>
 <p>Heng nearly bit his tongue. He yelled to TengYi, “Run further away! I will delay him. What did Zheng say before he disappeared?”</p>
 <p>TengYi ran to the backdoor of the shop. “Zheng said everyone’s lives are in my hands. He said my body is physically stronger than Freddy and wanted me to kill him…” His voice was growing further and further away.</p>
 <p>Heng also hid behind a wall. However, the Gauss pistol bullets shot through the wall and hit him. In the end, he had no choice but to lay on the ground. Heng pondered over what TengYi had just said then muttered, “That means we have to kill this Xuan that the demon transformed into. And the more the gap in Zheng’s heart widens, the more Xuan’s strength approaches the real Xuan. Interesting… Give me five minutes. I will be able to use another Lightning Shot. I will decide the battle with it!”</p>
 <p>On the other hand, TengYi carried LiuYu out through the shop’s backdoor. He immediately brought out the hemostasis spray. Whiling caring LiuYu with one hand, he sprayed the wounds with the other hand. This action naturally slowed his steps. Suddenly, something quickly moved before his eyes. A sharp pain registered from his left chest before he could react. TengYi fell forward onto the street.</p>
 <p>A man wearing a striped shirt and hat was standing by the alley he just fell out from. He was the same Freddy who Heng just pierced with an arrow. Yet, he appeared completely intact. Freddy licked the blood from his hand then looked toward TengYi with a wicked smile. He slid his up TengYi’s chest when he just stepped out from the alley. The five scissor blades sliced into TengYi’s chest.</p>
 <p>TengYi was now lying on the street with LiuYu. The wounds cut deep into his left chest. Blood gushed out from his mouth as he was unable to move.</p>
 <p>Freddy chuckled in a taunting manner. “It’s unfortunate for you. As long as my main body remains in this dream, I will come back with no limitation. Furthermore, my number increases as the gap in Zheng Zha’s heart widens. I will also possess greater and greater power. Can you still run away from me? Haha…”</p>
 <p>Freddy snapped his finger. A truck armored with steel spikes drove toward them from the distance. By the looks of it, just a scrape on the side would take away half TengYi’s life. Not to mention the truck was driving directly at him.</p>
 <p>TengYi was still conscious despite he was coughing blood. He stared at the truck helplessly. Despair overtook him.</p>
 <p>(What is filial piety? What is loyalty?)</p>
 <p>WangXia wept loudly as he stared at his mother’s memorial tablet. Blood flowed down his forehead and covered his face. His heart felt painful and lost. He was at a loss with regard to his duty, to everything he had done, and of his existence. He was aware this was a dream and everything was probably an illusion. But he still felt lost… The truth of the event didn’t matter anymore because his believed was shaken. WangXia let the claw behind him reach close without paying any attention to it.</p>
 <p>“…No…”</p>
 <p>As the claw was going to pierce his head, WangXia suddenly moved to the side. The claw only hit his shoulder. Freddy asked in a surprise, “No to what?”</p>
 <p>“A man can still be a hero even if he bends his knees… My grandfather was a soldier. My father was a soldier. I am a soldier… I might not be able to see my mother go but I will bring back to the real world the technologies, knowledge, and powers from God’s realm. I will place them in front of her grave and tell her, your son did not disappoint you… Your son is also a hero!”</p>
 <p>WangXia turned his head around. Blood slid down his forehead into his eyes… Those eyes looked red as blood.</p>
