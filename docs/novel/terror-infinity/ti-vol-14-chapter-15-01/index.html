 <p><strong>Vol 14: Chapter 15-1.</strong></p> (Correction, Lieutenant Ross to Captain Rose, a member of the other team.)
 <br> 
 <br> Zheng came to the seventh starship with the information. It was easy to navigate between starships with the mini shuttle. This kind of shuttles also served as survival capsules. Each one could only fit two people but they could sustain from the heat of entering the atmosphere. The speed wasn't slow either. The main female character escaped using the mini shuttle at the end of the movie. The only flaw was that the shuttle was only usable within space.
 <br> 
 <br> "Rose. Captain rank. A doctor in the biological study of Arachnids, done comprehensive research on the race. The first to come up with the hypothesis of brain bugs. Twenty one years old."
 <br> 
 <br> Zheng muttered to himself as he read the info. He didnt know where Xuan obtained this information. The info wasn't detailed but listed all the crucial facts such as how she rose to this rank and her hypothesis. This hypothesis along was enough to prove her as a member of the other team.
 <br> 
 <br> (Is this what Xuan wants to say? That this is their trump card. Once they find out all our members, they can label us as being controlled by the bugs and use the federation to wipe us.)
 <br> 
 <br> Zheng thought over the plan carefully. This was what he would do if he was in the other team. This influence could give them the win as long as they knew the names and location of every member on the other team. The title of doctor also gave her words authority. The most critical point was Zheng’s team performed too well. Once the higher ups doubt them as spies from the bugs, they would not want to take any chances. Furthermore, a bug that could enslave humans would definitely cause terror in society.
 <br> 
 <br> Zheng felt his heart getting chill as he thought through it. He even wanted to kill this Rose. However, remembering Xuan’s words that told him to just see this woman, killing her might mess up the plan and cut off any traces leading to the other team.
 <br> 
 <br> Zheng felt his brain turning into a mess. So he had to enter the third stage of the unlocked mode to simulate Honglu’s thinking process and continue the analysis.
 <br> 
 <br> The light dawned upon him. He had doubts when Xuan said the brain of the other team would send members to get killed by them, yet there was no reason given. This seemed absurd but their brain planned to use the death of his team members to clear the path to his survival!
 <br> 
 <br> Their team must have had usually stayed closely together. The troopers around them also knew this. When one of them died in this starship in a strange death, the others could spread words of people being controlled by the bugs and they had gathered evidence of such persons. That way, the federation would capture team China without a doubt.
 <br> 
 <br> “Such a ruthless plan!” Zheng sighed and praised it.
 <br> 
 <br> He finally saw the level of plans people like Xuan was thinking at, not something normal people would come up with. Among the people he knew, Xuan, Honglu, and this person from the other team should be similar in wits. Xuan was above the other two in comparison. Zheng himself never thought of utilizing all available resources to kill the other team without any physical fight.
 <br> 
 <br> The officers in the starship was notified of the death of that young man within just ten minutes. What Zheng got told was the young man died in a sudden heart attack during a brawl. A team was formed to investigate anyone the young man came in contact with before death. The officers also take notice of any abnormality among the troopers.
 <br> 
 <br> Zheng sighed as he exited the unlocked mode. He had be in this mode to think like this while Xuan was thinking all the time. He watched the shuttle enter another starship, the one Rose was in.
 <br> 
 <br> “No, this isn’t right!” Zheng growled as he clenched his fist. He murmured to himself as he left the shuttle. “He wouldn’t think like this. He wouldn’t do anything without any benefit in return. So benefits? Right!”
 <br> 
 <br> He immediately entered the third stage again to simulate Honglu. He twirled his hair. “Right, the benefit.”
 <br> 
 <br> Zheng thought back to the hero plan Xuan suggested. The reputation of the four of them grow to a peak that surpasses the officers. Then they will raise this influence and let their names spread throughout Earth, let the other team know team China is strong. Then he had Zheng kill the other team’s member without telling him the consequence, which made them step into the other team’s plan and he exposed Gando’s location. Everything…
 <br> 
 <br> All Zheng could do was sigh as he thought it through. Xuan was just Xuan. He avoided telling anyone the plan so no one would hesitate and mess up the plan. He simply enacted the plan without saying anything.
 <br> 
 <br> It was too hard to find the other team. So instead of looking for them, he had them show themselves. To make them do so, the thing he had to do was let the other team feel that they had won. Gando’s exposure was one piece, killing their member was the second. They were means to make the brain of the other team feel optimistic. Yet everything was within Xuan’s control.
 <br> 
 <br> The only thing Xuan needed to do was spread the rumors before they do. Rumors that these officers controlled by bugs planned to kill their heroes and all the troopers who fought in the battle to extinguish the hope of humanity. When both sides blame each other and the troopers were suspicious, the four of them could use their reputation to incite some troopers to act. Then they could gain control of the starships and open fire. If they get rewarded from the starships destroyed in this process, the amount would be…
 <br> 
 <br> Zheng shook his head and exited the unlocked mode. He then walked toward the dissecting room.
