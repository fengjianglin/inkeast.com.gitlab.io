 <p>One of Air Force One's wings ignited and the fire engulfed half the wing. Its tail appeared damaged. It was fortunate that the presidential plane remained in flight at this point despite that it was wobbling.</p>
 <p>The sight of a hundred spaceships coming after Air Force One was astonishing. Almost no one inside the plane had any mean of defending themselves. If these spaceships were to come near and hit the plane with one or two lasers, everyone aside from Zheng would burn within the resulting firework.</p>
 <p>"The Gauss Sniper Rifle is approximately fifty to a hundred years more advanced than the technology of this Earth. However, the alien's defensive barrier and energy storage system are two to three hundred years ahead of this Earth. It would need around three shots for a normal bullet to deplete the energy of a barrier. Three shots' time is enough for a lot of things to happen." HongLu explained to team China and the American politicians on the plane.</p>
 <p>Team China managed to destroy all one hundred spaceships before Air Force One suffered critical damage with the contribution of Zheng's insane performance, Zero and Heng's long range attacks, and Imhotep's sandstorm. This victory achieved more success than all the battles the United States military had combined. The politicians exploited this inconceivable victory as much as they could. A victory was more important than any reinforcement people could receive right now. They centered around team China requesting the weapons the team supposedly obtained from the aliens. In the very least, they wanted to discover how to craft the weapons if team China wouldn't give them away. This was a consequence of the fabricated story portraying team China as test subjects who escaped from the aliens with extraterrestrial technologies.</p>
 <p>Zheng was covered in injuries and had completely depleted his energy after the battle. He wished to drop down and sleep for the next few days to recover. Coming up with more lies to deceive the politicians was out of the equation for him. So, this important task was delegated to HongLu, though the boy could be mischievous at times. Most of the team walked into the meeting room.</p>
 <p>Not all the people who accompanied the president were mediocre. There were a lot of talented scientists. They had analyzed the data obtained from the previous battle and discovered that Zero needed two to three shots with normal bullets to destroy a spaceship, whereas Heng only needed one arrow through a primitive weapon to destroy a spaceship. Heng shot down a great number of spaceships after they came near.</p>
 <p>"It's not strange at all. First point is our body structures are vastly superior to your best agents. Even when compared to me, they can only win in size and techniques. My stamina and burst of strength are greater than all of you here." HongLu rolled his eyes at the Americans. He stood up then lifted the sofa he was sitting on with one arm. This sofa was bigger than his own body.</p>
 <p>The military personnel's face darkened. It was embarrassing to be looked down at by a boy. However, they were excited at the possibility of reproducing this bodily enhancement. If they were able to apply the enhancement to themselves who had a higher starting point than the members of team China had, they would become super humans.</p>
 <p>"The bow is also an advance technological weapon. Even the arrows are more advanced than you can think of. Show them the power of an enchanted arrow." HongLu giggled and said to Heng.</p>
 <p>Heng sighed. He was an honest man so deceiving people like this wasn't a good feeling. However, an order was an order. He brought out an enchanted arrow then threw it over on the steel table in front of the military personnel's. The arrowhead stabbed into the tabletop. Before people could react to the arrow, a hole expanded from the point of contact and the arrow fell from the table.</p>
 <p>The military personnel immediately walked near to study the table. There was no liquid or sign of sublimation around the hole. The space seemed to have existed when the table was crafted. A section of the table simply disappeared, which meant the arrow wasn't coated in corrosive liquid.</p>
 <p>"Like you saw, the arrows contain an advanced technology that can penetrate matter and energy. It's a counter to the spaceships' barriers. The Gauss sniper rifle outputs pure force in contrast." HongLu said.</p>
 <p>(He's deceiving them but that isn't a complete lie. The arrows rely on their enchanted property to penetrate the barriers. The barriers are similar to the one invoked by the dragonshard and probably only defends against sci-fi attacks.) Heng thought.</p>
 <p>HongLu continued with his lies while he was thinking. The Americans looked dumbfounded and had fallen into the lies. Heng sighed.</p>
 <p>On the other side of the plane, there were two people who were too exhausted to even move a finger. Zheng and Imhotep were talking about random topics. Xuan was tapping on his laptop not far away as if the previous battle had nothing to do with him.</p>
 <p>"You look like a drug addict craving heroin, Imhotep. Haha. Your body is weak." Zheng mocked Imhotep with a pale face.</p>
 <p>Imhotep glanced over at him. The bald man lived in the United States for some time so he knew what heroin was. Neither of their faces looked good. They were both adepts at using the body's inner energy. Zheng used the energy for combat and Imhotep used it to maintain his life form. Naturally, Imhotep would turn out worse than Zheng.</p>
 <p>Near the end of the previous battle, Zheng could no longer block the numerous incoming lasers by himself. A laser grazed Air Force One's tail and put it on the verge of exploding. At the same time, the number of spaceships chasing after the plane were still in large numbers. Heng and Zero weren't able to destroy them all at once. A sandstorm emerged out of nowhere and enveloped both Air Force One and the spaceships, blowing them out of balance. However, this allowed the plane to evade the lasers. Heng and Zero also didn't have to aim with much effort at such short distance. Their accuracy remained at a hundred percent given their skills and enhancements. The sandstorm saved Air Force One.</p>
 <p>"I have to thank you. I was almost hopeless back there." Zheng sighed. "We would have wiped without your help. Haha. We are comrades who fight by each other's sides from now on."</p>
 <p>Imhotep didn't know whether to feel good or angry at him.</p>
 <p>Air Force One arrived at the air force base without any further assaults. As soon as the plane landed, the officers in the base escorted the president, the politicians and team China into the facility. No one felt the fortune of surviving the assault as the disaster they witnessed happening on the ground shocked them.</p>
 <p>On alien spiders occupied areas, a species of red plant grew from the earth at a very fast rate. The majority of native plants withered. The red plants had probably seized all the nutrients from the other plants. American intel stated the aliens began to massacre humans. Human blood and flesh were processed into these plants which… the critical factor noted was the plants produced carbon monoxide instead of oxygen, a gas toxic to humans.</p>
 <p>"Are the aliens planning to exterminate humans?" The president looked over everyone here and said with grief.</p>
 <p>"Not planning to." Zheng was looking at the image on the wall. It was a moving image of the red plants growing. Human flesh was being fed to the bottom of the plant. Zheng frowned. "They are already doing it. Mankind is at the brink of extinction."</p>
