 <p>Hey guys, I'm excited to let you know that <a href="https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/physicians-odyssey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Physician's Odyssey</a> is now out of sneak peek and available for everyone to read, with 60 chapters to start! &nbsp;This is a modern wuxia novel that is part of our big 2019 kickoff to more genres.&nbsp; Authored by Smoking Pipe Bro and translated by Wuxiaworld veteran Thyaeria (who is also working with us on The Great Ruler and Tales of Demons &amp; Gods), this Zongheng novel brings us the story of the brilliant physician Su Tao.&nbsp; Su Tao is a medical genius, but just wants to maintain...</p>

<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Although Optimus Prime intended to sacrifice himself for mankind. But he wouldn’t be allowed to sacrifice himself just because he wanted to. He was protecting this base after all. He explained the Spark within every Transformer was a mini AllSpark without its unique power. The Sparks radiated a power that protected nearby mechanical objects from the AllSpark’s power.</p>
 <p>“The Spark’s powers are separated into two attributes much like Yin(dark) and Yang(light). If the Autobots’s Sparks are Yang, the Decepticons’ Sparks are Yin. Hence as the two parties of Transformers nears each other, they could sense the existence of the other even in their vehicle or object forms. Which means our plan to sneak into the Decepticons’ city becomes impossible as soon as our weapons become affected by the Sparks. The only way we have at that point is to charge in after the nuclear strikes. The few of us might have to fight a thousand or more Decepticons. This isn’t a fight we can bear… As such, we need to initiate a bait tactic.” Xuan looked at the people in front while eating a banana.</p>
 <p>Zheng felt strange as he looked at the banana. He thought to himself why did this dude suddenly changed his habit? But things that pertained to the team’s survival took priority. He asked. “I can understand having a bait to lure the majority of Decepticons away from the AllSpark. Which is why you and HongLu should plan it out together and come up with the perfect plan. One more thing, about Optimus Prime…”</p>
 <p>Zheng looked around and said awkwardly. “Not going to lie. I admired Optimus Prime when I watched the animation and the movie. After his death, I did not watched the sequels. So I want to.”</p>
 <p>Xuan waved his hand. “It isn’t difficult to save Optimus Prime. The Spark’s power is also a form of energy. Coincidentally, energy is something we have great control over… The One Ring. Your Qi can be converted into the Spark’s power or even to the Decepticon Spark’s power. Unfortunately, we haven’t obtained the Decepticon Spark’s form yet. Hm… I understand.” Xuan showed an expression of enlightened. He put his hand over his forehead and murmured to himself.</p>
 <p>It had been so long since Zheng saw such action from Xuan. He always understood everything without you even realizing when. Expressions of enlightenment were extremely rare. Although Zheng didn’t know what he figured out.</p>
 <p>“The One Ring is a product of the Saints, similar to the mask. However, neither of them are complete products. It seems like all the quest items are such products. The One Ring can convert energy. The golden mask allows a person in the fourth stage to experience the fifth stage once. The Spear of Osiris, the Bracelet of Anubis are all weapons or items with a main focus on energy manipulation. What the Saints are trying to tell us… Perhaps we speculated it wrong! We were wrong! Perhaps God’s realm isn’t created as a training ground to create new Saints… Perhaps… this is the last refuge created to leave their final words.” Xuan frowned. It would be beyond any living being’s capacity to deduce the truth with the little amount of information in hand. Not even he could accomplish this feat with his intelligence. Xuan needed information to deduce and he was met with such lack of information.</p>
 <p>“What are the Saints trying to tell us? The One Ring, the Spear of Osiris, the golden mask, Xiuzhen that was related to the wipe of the Saints. What are they trying to tell us?”</p>
 <p>Seeing the frowning was getting increasingly tense in Xuan, Zheng hurriedly said. “Leave this for later. Let’s talk about what’s coming now. Since the issue concerning Optimus Prime is solved, the remaining questions is choosing the bait. This is going to be an extremely dangerous task. You can’t accomplish it without the necessary strength. Why don’t I be the person of choice. I should have the strength for this task…”</p>
 <p>Xuan rejected the suggestion firmly. “No. Your combat strength is important for the ambush. You will likely fight dozens or more Decepticons at the same time. Your task is to defeat them and seize the AllSpark. So you can’t be the bait. The person of choice is…”</p>
 <p>(Fuck. It’s definitely going to be me. I don’t know how much he hates me. He’s been intentionally difficult with me every time.) Gando was hating him.</p>
 <p>Xuan turned to HongLu and said. “I will hand the task to you. You can choose three people from the team aside from Zheng, Zero, and Lan. I don’t care how you do it. We will ambush within an hour after the nuclear strike. Your task is to lure away at least 70% of all the Transformers. When our team ambushes, there can’t be more than 30% of the Decepticons protecting the AllSpark. Understood?”</p>
 <p>The order had such a militaristic style. Xuan only wanted the results and disregarded the process. HongLu accepted it without any hesitation.</p>
 <p>Seeing that Zheng wanted to say something, Xuan said. “As we get more members and our strength increase, the team must be reorganized. It is inevitable to for us to end up with two parties and cooperate with each other. Our strength as team will increase as a result. The Transformers world isn’t dangerous. It’s perfect to let us become familiar with this style… This is the basic situation. Zheng and Gando, for the next five days starting from this afternoon, you will proceed with the search. I will also proceed with my plan. Zheng bring Lan back at the third day whether you found the AllSpark or not.”</p>
 <p>Zheng smiled bitterly as he agreed. Was there really no danger in this world? The robots were in the millions, the AllSpark’s location was still unknown, and the power of the robots could all push the team into an abyss. Perhaps their only advantage was the influences they had obtained. The American government and military, and the nuclear weapons were their influences. These were probably the factors Xuan believed could turn the tide of the battle. The key was how he controlled these influences.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, HongLu was lost in thought once he accepted the task from Xuan. He was feeling unease. (He handed the task to me. Did he perceive my plan? That can’t be. I haven’t shown any indication of the plan. He couldn’t perceive it no matter how miraculous he is. Then why did he do this?)</p>
 <p>The next day, Zheng brought Lan and Gando piloted his robot to two different directions. They had to find the gather place of the Decepticons. Before they left, Zheng converted a bunch of fire energy stones into the Autobot Spark’s power using the One Ring. He coated the Valkyrie’s armor with this power. Once it neared any gather site of the Decepticons, they would attack him for certain. It saved him from attacking each city.</p>
 <p>Time flew by. The remaining nine people stayed in Shelter 1. They did not do anything out of place. The military also didn’t place much control over them. As Xuan handed out some minor sci-fi items, the researchers went into mad scientist mode and researched the items with all their attention. A scrap metal that was completely different from any metal in this Earth. Humans did not have the technology to replicate this metal. This was a scrap Xuan got from the Valkyrie, a piece of gundanium alloy. The American government focused their attention on him.</p>
 <p>“Then? Did you do all of this for the nuclear weapon passwords? They are dynamic passwords. Each one can only be used once and each nuclear weapon requires a new password. Can you steal all the passwords?” Zheng was curious.</p>
 <p>Xuan shook his head. “It’s not possible to steal all the passwords. There is no need to steal but rather control the generation. Due to the security placed on nuclear weapons, it is nearly impossible to steal the passwords from the outside. What about getting them from the inside? The moment they open the computer that contained the passwords is when we should act… Lan, YinKong, start.”</p>
