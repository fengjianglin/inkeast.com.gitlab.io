<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>The man named Xuan was acting suspiciously.</p>
 <p>Top officials of the American government and military assembled in a secret conference room. Their topic was those who called themselves warriors from the future, and the man named Xuan.</p>
 <p>“I believe everyone understands that these people might have come from the future but this possibility is low. Thus, I ordered surveillance two days ago. The latest surveillance technologies were set up in the rooms of their central figures. They seemed to have not discovered these cameras and that was how we noticed Xuan’s abnormality.”</p>
 <p>Roosevelt nodded to the soldier standing behind. The soldier went over to the wall and pressed a series of buttons. The room dimmed. The table in front of the group turned into a screen. The screen played a scene of Xuan using a computer.</p>
 <p>Roosevelt said in a serious tone as he looked at the screen. “This man’s computer skills are extremely advanced. I sent an expert in the field to examine his computer after he left the room, but to no avail. He cleaned all the traces of ever using it. Furthermore, this computer is connected to the internal network of this base. Our expert then analyzed from our network and discovered… that he attempted to hack into our classified areas. He has opened a crack in our firewall, which points to the location of the password for our nuclear weapon arsenal.”</p>
 <p>Everyone in the room was shocked and angry. A black officer shouted. “What are we waiting for? Arrest them then interrogate who they work for. How can we tolerate these people? I knew they were lying. People from the future? How can such a thing be believed?”</p>
 <p>Roosevelt turned to a man among the researchers. “Go over the items brought by Xuan, and the piece of metal.”</p>
 <p>This researcher was older than Roosevelt, looking in his sixties or seventies. The old man stood up and looked down at the data on hand. His expression had a sense of fanaticism. “The little things aren’t as important for now. Those are only fifty years ahead of our technology. The key is the technological advancement of the metal. I can’t tell how many years it is beyond our technology but I am certain this metal is beyond even the metal of the Transformers. This piece of metal represents a high-tech world way beyond our world!</p>
 <p>“Furthermore, they possess applications of spatial technology. Do you know what it means? Mature spatial technology is three to five hundred years ahead of us! This isn’t something you can fake. I believe they truly come from the future! I do not wish to understand the filth of your politics. I am just a researcher, one who wishes to study the wonders of spatial technology.”</p>
 <p>Some of the politicians blushed. Their evidences to invalidate the future humans claim were the lack of protection team China had against the power of the AllSpark and that they had no knowledge of what the last hopes of mankind were. However, based on what the researcher had said, this team of future warriors might perhaps be victims the future government threw to this world, either due to using unstable time-space technology or political reasons that denied them access to top classified information. The future government might have control over the AllSpark.</p>
 <p>Roosevelt said awkwardly. “It is too early to conclude whether they are victims of politics. Based on certain information we have, they possess the attributes of people from the future. The advanced weapons, the spatial technology, and the physical attributes of their bodies could prove they have come from the future. Yet, at the same time there are many flaws we cannot find an explanation to. We have to continue monitoring them…”</p>
 <p>The door to the room was suddenly pushed open. Everyone in the room was surprised and turned toward the door. Several men in black attires were standing there and yelled in a panic. “Mr. President, the surveillance videos show Xuan has breached into the location containing the nuclear weapon arsenal passwords!”</p>
 <p>“Impossible!” Roosevelt shot up, terrified. “That’s impossible! The Black Box sends the password to the military bases, which in turn send them to the nuclear missiles. The key to the Black Box never leaves me! How could he break into the Black Box?” He took off a normal looking silver key from his neck. This key signified the highest power of the country, the key that controlled nuclear weapons.</p>
 <p>Cold sweat streamed down everyone. It was not normal technology that was stolen but nuclear weapons. One missile could wipe out a city. In this situation where mankind was in a calamity, a nuclear missile could drive mankind into destruction.</p>
 <p>“Hurry! Keep Xuan under watch! Do not let him get into contact with any of his team! Do not let him leave his room! Cut off his access to internet! If he forces his way out of the room… fire!” Roosevelt then ran toward his room.</p>
 <p>The Black Box was a laptop. A key was required to turn on the laptop. The president had to turn on the laptop with his key and generate a password. Three other people then had to verify the password before sending it to the nuclear missile sites. Once the main officer in control and his assistant officer verified the password again, they could fire the nuclear missile.</p>
 <p>The password began at the key, which was why it signified the highest authority of the country. And now this authority was stolen!</p>
 <p>“How can this be possible? The key is still in my hand! How could it get stolen?” Roosevelt murmured to himself. He was drenched in cold sweat. Despite hearing that Xuan had obtained the password, he would not believe it without confirming it with his own eyes whether the Black Box was safe or stolen away.</p>
 <p>Roosevelt ordered several guards to watch the door then rushed into his room and locked it. He walked over to the wall and entered a set of password. The wall opened up, revealing a rack holding a black box. He took off the key from his neck with his trembling hands. He carefully inserted the key. With a turn of the key, the black box opened up. Embedded inside was a black laptop. The screen lighted up.</p>
 <p>Roosevelt took several deep breaths. He entered a password over forty digits long. A menu appeared on the screen and the item noting new passwords was 0.</p>
 <p>“Whew… The password hasn’t been stolen.” Roosevelt wiped the sweat off his face. He was nearly drained.</p>
 <p>The phone rang at this moment, which scared Roosevelt fore a moment before he reached for the phone in his pocket.</p>
 <p>“Mr. President, we have checked our network. There are no signs of being hacked and the section related to the nuclear weapon password is intact. No traces in the firewall. It was a mistake on our agents.”</p>
 <p>Roosevelt breathed out. “Understood. Halt the surveillance on Xuan. He’s freed of suspicion.”</p>
 <p>As soon as he turned off the phone, something struck his mind and he fell into a hazy state. A little girl walked out from the shadows in the corner. It was YinKong. She walked pass Roosevelt to the laptop then inserted a CD into the drive. A series of characters flowed down the screen. A minute later, the screen returned normal and YinKong removed the CD.</p>
 <p>“Xuan, delivery completed. I will hide until the guards change shift.” YinKong muttered in her mind.</p>
 <p>Xuan’s voice sounded. “Thank you for the work. The password is in our hand. Lan, remove psyche control and erase this piece of memory.”</p>
 <p>Those who had been watching the scene unfold admired Xuan. HongLu curled his lips despite knowing it was beautifully played out. The firewall was difficult to break through from the outside but how about bypassing it and obtaining the password from the inside? He might not have come up with the same plan that Xuan did…</p>
 <p>The fourth day after Gando left, he found the gathering place of the Decepticons. The number far exceeded their imagination.</p>
