<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Zheng hadn't spoken to Xuan ever since he was told about turning their created beings into Nemesis's. He didn't get into an argument with Xuan. He just needed to think through some things.</p>
 <p>Obtaining the heart of slayer also changed his decision making. One of the change was how he viewed staying alive. As long as the nature of himself didn't deviate, and he killed only those who deserved to be killed, then killing was acceptable to him. But everything should have a boundary. How could he decide who deserved to get killed?</p>
 <p>"Xuan, it's fine to turn the created beings into Nemesis's. I remember when creating them, you can choose everything about them. You can even create a body without a mind, a slave that would only listen to your commands. If that's the case, 500 points can get us a strong fighter who unlocked his first stage. However, is that really suitable?" He pondered for quite some time before asking.</p>
 <p>Xuan was looking through the documents in his hands as he walked. He replied without raising his head. "Can't get over your consciousness? Do you need me to give you some psychotherapy?"</p>
 <p>"No, no need." Zheng hurriedly replied. He knew very well what kind of person Xuan was. If Xuan were to perform any kind of psychotherapy on him, he would either go insane or get brainwashed, in the very least he would develop schizophrenia.</p>
 <p>So he replied. "It has nothing to do with consciousness since we can treat them as empty vessels because they don't have a mind. However, the Nemesis's are strong but are large numbers of them really suitable?"</p>
 <p>That was when Xuan finally turned his head around and looked at Zheng. There was a hint of surprise you would rarely see in his eyes. "You are right. That's why I didn't say we are creating a large numbers of Nemesis's. I just told you of this effect of the prototype T virus. You should know we are not the only team in this realm. The next movie is Lord of the Rings. If we can obtain influence in that world then capture the natives of that world to create Nemesis's, we won't have to spend too many points to create them. We don't even have to spend much to exchange weapons. All we need to give them are some close range weapons. Getting these bodyguards out of nothing is my plan."</p>
 <p>He understood what Zheng was getting to. If they were to create Nemesis's from God's realm, they would have to exchange weapons also. Even if enhancements weren't necessary, each one would cost them at least 3000 points. The teleportation beams were also limited in size. So they couldn't bring a large number of Nemesis's into the movie worlds. Which meant they would end up having to spend point to increase the power of each Nemesis they had.</p>
 <p>Xuan obviously considered this already and his plan was much more ruthless. The movie worlds they went into had people inside so they could just turn those people into Nemesis's. That would give them large numbers of Nemesis's which could become useful even with simple weapons.</p>
 <p>"Since we have obtained a method to increase a person's strength instantly, we have to maximize the effect of it. Instead of wasting our points and rewards to create fighters, which isn't beneficial to our own growth, we might as well create these fighters in the world of Lord of the Rings. Judging from the method of manufacturing the prototype T virus on these documents, I think i can create eighty portions before entering the next movie. You wouldn't disagree using these on the Orcs, right?"</p>
 <p>Zheng felt settled. Xuan didn't usually explain much but he always considered all possibilities. Zheng was worried xuan would create slaves for a temporary increase in the team's strength, which was actually detrimental to the team. Now that Xuan became clear with him, he would be happy to show off in the next movie.</p>
 <p>They went from the forest into the mining cave. The entrance was blocked off but they easily got inside by using Tiger's Soul. The last one to enter was WangXia. He knew methods to cover up their traces and fake traces to other paths. After Wangxia entered the cave, Zheng blocked off the entrance again.</p>
 <p>"The data shows this mining cave has been abandoned for over thirty years. However, the bedrock is stable so there haven't been any earthquakes and the cave remained. By the end of the mining operation, they dug into a crevice. 100 meters beyond the crevice was the underground water tunnels to the city."</p>
 <p>Xuan didn't slack off after he sent Zheng out as a bait. He conceived the details of the attack and their escape plan. After he found out about this cave, he immediately came over with Lan to inspect the crevice underground. He finally confirmed this escape route. Umbrella Corporation wouldn't be able to track the water tunnels with their satellites. Once their time was up, they could return to the alley they entered and go back.</p>
 <p>The air was muddy since the cave had been closed off for so many years. Their bodies were stronger than normal people but they still couldn't breathe air like this for a long period of time. The soil was wet and the air was more humid than they had imagined.</p>
 <p>Luckily they had over a dozen oxygen bottles in the dimensional bag. It seemed like Xuan had prepared for this situation. The team had no risk of suffocating for now but Zero just had a craniotomy so he was at risk of getting infected by the dripping water even though the hemostasis spray and bandage had antibacterial effect. If bacteria got into his brain, things were difficult to say.</p>
 <p>They continued moving. Zheng took over Zero from Kampa. He didn't know if it was useful but he still channeled his Qi into Zero's body and hoped to raise his body's immunization. This didn't last long.</p>
 <p>A few hours after they entered the cave, they came to the end of the mining cave. Zheng had to open the way with Tiger's Soul which forced him to stop giving Zero Qi. The road became difficult to walk and narrow. Lan also had to keep her scan on to avoid Zheng causing too much damage and collapsing the place.</p>
 <p>Zheng finally dug through the hundred meter wall and the team entered the city's water tunnels. Everyone was covered in soil and rocks. Xuan's plans were always so complete. He actually found an abandoned break room in the tunnels. Otherwise they would have to spend the rest of their time here with the foul smell in their soil soaked bodies.</p>
 <p>Another hour passed. Everyone cleaned themselves and had some simple foods. They were finally able to sleep. They had been fighting since attacking the two buildings then had to escape and went underground. The road was difficult to walk on. Everyone was exhausted at this point. They found an empty area and just lay on the ground. Snores came on in just a few minutes.</p>
 <p>By the time the team woke up, the time was already night of the twentieth day. There were only a few hours left before they had to return. They had some more food then moved along the water tunnels. Lan assisted their navigation with psyche scan. Two hours later, they came out from a manhole on the street. Only ten minutes left before time was up.</p>
 <p>"Keep going along the street. The second turn ahead is the alley we came in." Lan said to the team.</p>
 <p>The others nodded. Zheng walked in front with Zero on his back. It was only a two minute walk. Everyone calmly walked and didn't show any panicking expressions. As they went into the alley, Zheng noticed a black sedan driving by. There were two beautiful women and two men in the sedan. Oh and there was a little girl leaning on the window. However, she looked at the other side of the street and didn't see Zheng.</p>
 <p>Zheng gave a smile as the sedan drove away then turned back to the alley.</p>
 <p>"We will be back. We will!"</p>
