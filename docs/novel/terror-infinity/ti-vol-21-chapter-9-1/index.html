<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p>When God’s notification appeared, Cheng Xiao had already ended his battle. Cheng Xiao had completed his slaughter of the Urgal soldiers surrounding him. The surviving Urgal soldiers were scared stupid and all stared blankly at the mincemeat on the ground. Those were the Urgal soldiers killed by Nanto Suicho Ken. In truth, Cheng Xiao with his Nanto Suicho Ken and martial arts mastery had made this fellow practically a human meat grinder. When they were touched they were injured, when they were hit they died…&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Of course, this referred to when the opponent’s strength wasn’t too extreme, like Zheng.</p>
 <p>“Let’s continue. Gentlemen, don't just stand there in a daze! I&nbsp;am&nbsp;in a rush here.” Chen Xiao mimicked Bruce Lee’s "come and get some" hand gesture and beckoned them with his hands, sounding very proud of himself.</p>
 <p>Whoosh!</p>
 <p>There was a whistling sound, and a giant fireball was heading towards him. It frightened him into stepping down and hurriedly fleeing backwards. A violent explosion immediately occured where the fireball fell. It didn’t look to be any inferior to a grenade.</p>
 <p>Another fireball was floating in Durza’s hand. He laughed cruelly, before saying hoarsely, “What good luck. I actually found TWO young dragons. No, it should be two mountless Dragon Riders. It’s too lucky. The king will surely reward me well if I kill you. Hahaha, yes, the king shall give me the greatest reward!” Thus saying, he tossed over the fireball.</p>
 <p>Cheng Xiao wasn’t flustered this time round. He agilely leapt back to avoid the fireball. Then, his foot stomped down hard. When he was in midair, this fellow retrieved the Sky Stick from the bag of holding. Then, his entire body flew in mid air.</p>
 <p>"Huh?" Everyone looked in wonder at the Sky Stick. This small thing could actually let someone fly? In their imagination, this item belonged to the magic category. Especially when a Dragon Rider took it out, it likely represented he could use his dragon mount’s magic.</p>
 <p>“Hahaha…”Cheng Xiao seemed to have gone mad. Everyone stared blankly at him. This fellow immediately started laughing exaggeratedly, his hand still making Bruce Lee’s provoking hand gestures. Of course, he wasn’t an idiot. It wasn’t possible to stand at his original position and be a target, so he did these actions and manipulated the Sky Stick, charging towards Durza.</p>
 <p>Durza too, wasn’t an idiot. He was a magician. Although he had melee combat ability and some measure of skill with the sword, his melee combat strength was practically zero before that exaggerated standard of Cheng Xiao’s Nanto Suicho Ken. Perhaps, he would instantaneously turn into mincemeat as soon as Cheng Xiao neared. When he saw the Sky Stick approaching, he spread his arms and recited an incantation. When Cheng Xiao was five or six metres from him, a flaming pillar suddenly interposed itself between him and Durza. It forced Cheng Xiao to change his direction, while Durza continuously chanted the incantation. The vicinity within a hundred metres burned nonstop. Even the surrounding Urgals and main characters were surrounded by the sea of flames.</p>
 <p>“Eragon, all of you run! Leave this fellow to me!” Cheng Xiao shouted. He steered the Sky Stick towards the sky. Being familiar with the plot, he knew this Shade wanted to summon that giant bat of his.</p>
 <p>As expected, the flames next to Durza surged. The flames gathered on his body, then formed a giant flaming pillar that rose to the heavens. When the flames dispersed, Durza was already stepping on a giant bat with a body ten metres in length that looked extremely savage.</p>
 <p>Durza howled madly nonstop on the bat’s back. It was as if each fireball emitted didn’t need magic as they were hurled at Cheng Xiao. Cheng Xiao steered the Sky Stick a few times, trying to approach him, but he was no longer forced back by the bat’s sharp teeth, instead burnt back by flames everytime. In the end, it was Durza chasing Cheng Xiao around in the air. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Eragon side quest begins. Rescue Arya. As well as all who protect and are willing to follow her, bring them all out of the capital. All team members will obtain 5000 points and a rank B reward. If Arya dies, all members will be deducted 10000 points and two rank B rewards.”</p>
 <p>“Eragon mission, destroy Alagaesia’s capital!”</p>
 <p>At this time, God’s notification sounded in Cheng Xiao’s mind. A slight distraction, and a fireball exploded several metres from him. The shockwaves knocked him off the Sky Stick. Fortunately, he was agile. He managed to use a single hand as support to flip himself over, thus managing to stand stably once again.“It’s finally begun? It really was as he expected. This type of side quest mission… In other words, don’t we need a long time before we can complete it? Hurry up Zheng, this fellow is too powerful. I can’t hold out for much longer!”</p>
 <p>“In other words, don’t we need a long time before we can complete it? Hurry up Xuan, this fellow is too powerful. I can’t hold out for much longer!” At basically the exact same moment, Zheng was howling loudly in the Abyss. He looked terrible through and through. Ignoring his entire body that was charred black, the web between his forefinger and thumb of the hand holding Tiger’s Soul was split open. He looked like he had just been barbecued, and cut a sorry figure. That pillar of flesh and blood before him was still rising upwards as before. The giant three headed dog and eight armed three headed female demon had been killed by him already. The corpses had quickly been devoured by those small reptiles. Apart from those two demons, there was still an even stronger demon standing before him.</p>
 <p>The Balrog. It had made several teams suffer under it in Lord of the Rings, and it hadn’t even been at its strongest state. It had already been so strong while weakened, while Zheng was now facing a complete Balrog, a monster able to match his Destruction.The Balrog was ten metres tall, its entire body giving out blazing white flames. It was an extremely high temperature that even the Red Flame couldn’t completely negate. In addition, it had a flaming demonic sword that matched Tiger’s Soul and a long whip that could turn into a flaming snake. It was power that rivalled Destruction. It’s sole flaw was perhaps its agility and lack of flight.</p>
 <p>“This is the enemy of ancient humanity? I really wonder how our ancestors in ancient times beat these Balrogs when they were still monkeys?” Zheng said to himself as he dodged a blazing white fireball the Balrog hurled over. This fireball’s power was terrifying and had reached a quarter of a miniature nuclear bomb’s power. But Zheng easily avoided it with his speed. This Balrog’s greatest weakness was its speed.</p>
 <p>(While I say it’s a weakness, it’s not too big of one. After all, it can break through technique with force. I’ll need to activate Destruction, but it has a time limit, while the Balrog doesn’t. In other words, this monster can use force to break through technique for the usual power of Destruction. To beat it, I’ll need to use the mid fourth stage or something even stronger!)</p>
 <p>“Dragon Transformation!” Zheng shouted. The mid fourth stage finally unlocked and his figure began to expand. It finally entered the Dragon Transformation state. Previously using Geppou, he now finally achieved true flight. A pair of dragon wings flapped on his back.</p>
 <p>(Destruction’s power increases by at least several folds after Dragon Transformation. This can definitely overpower this monster. Only, this monster is already so strong. How powerful will the ones below be?)</p>
 <p>Zheng looked silently at the Balrog after transforming. The giant cocoon behind the Balrog had grown to a diameter of a hundred and fifty metres and was still expanding at a visible rate. As Zheng and the Balrog confronted each other, the pillar slowly rose to almost a thousand metres. Although it was far from the hole entrance just as before, the pillar continued to rise continuously with the endless appearances of reptiles and them intertwining themselves among one another.</p>
 <p>(If I don’t stop the rise of this pillar, the pillar will reach the entrance hole in at most ten minutes. At that time, Xuan and the rest won’t be able to block them based on the Balrog’s and the previous few monster’s power, unless they use the Magic Cannon! But at that time, I’ll die in this Abyss.)</p>
 <p>Zheng exhaled. His line of vision passed the Balrog and looked at the giant cocoon on the Abyss’s ground. The pressure it gave him was too great. Heaven knows where such an organism came from. If it was one that exceeded him in power, he could only give his utmost in fleeing. But if he fled up there now, his companions would likely...“Aim first at the rider’s horse and go for the bandit’s chief first! Dammit, I’ll try my best!”</p>
 <p>Zheng ignored the Balrog, and shot to the cocoon with one flap of his wings. Just as he descended to a hundred metres height, an incomparably fiery aura flared behind him. The Balrog had jumped up to a height of almost two thousand metres without any regard for its life. The fiery aura before was caused by it brandishing its flaming whip. Unable to guard in time, the whip had wrapped around Zheng’s leg and dragged his entire body over, sending him crashing towards the ground.</p>
 <p>“Dammit, even monsters know how to try their best these days? It’s trying its best to stop me from destroying the cocoon? How could I let you do as you please?”</p>
 <p>Zheng was being pestered into annoyance. The feeling of that burning white flaming whip also wan’t pleasant. This was well and truly barbecuing his flesh, and he could clearly smell the stench of burning flesh. Most importantly, that was HIS flesh!</p>
 <p>“Go die!” Zheng shouted loudly. He no longer tried to struggle free downwards, instead shooting backwards abruptly along the whip. He directly collided into the Balrog’s embrace. Destruction-class power frenziedly erupted. He actually violently tore at the Balrog’s waist, trying to rip the Balrog into two halves...</p>
 <p>At the same time, the blood cocoons on the ground began to disorderly wriggle, a seeming omen of it hatching…</p>
