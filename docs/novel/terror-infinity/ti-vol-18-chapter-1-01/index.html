<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>The scenery had changed to that of God’s dimension as Zheng opened his eyes again. Though his injuries were so heavy that he lacked even the ability to speak a word. Blood was flowing out from his lungs. Finally, someone yelled for God to heal the whole team and deduct the points from the respective members. A beam shot down from God and enveloped each member.</p>
 <p>(So many beams… everyone made it back alive.) Zheng had difficulty moving his head so he looked around with his peripheral vision. There were several girls on the floor and about ten beams. The sight calmed him down and he slowly savored the pain from the repair at the DNA level.</p>
 <p>“What?” Zheng grabbed Kampa by the collar and cried in anger. “Why? Gando died? Impossible! How could we return if he died? That’s impossible! He must have completed the trust I placed on him. He must have kept the AllSpark until the last second! You lied. How could he have died?”</p>
 <p>Kampa opened his lips but no words came out. He shook his head.</p>
 <p>Zero walked over to Zheng and gave a sigh. “We are sorry. Gando died. He brought the AllSpark to us but then the Valkyrie ran out of energy. The robots got…”</p>
 <p>“What were you doing?” Zheng continued to shout. “Everyone was fighting with their lives. I am certain Gando was really giving all he had. He didn’t run. He fulfilled the task I entrusted him… How could you let him die?”</p>
 <p>The rest of the team met eyes with each other. There was nothing they could say in reply. It was an accident. If YinKong was a bit faster and sliced the robot’s arm, if Zero was ready to shoot at the time, if Heng could shoot faster, if Kampa or WangXia happened to kill that robot… There were so many ifs. Yet, every human only had one life. Ifs couldn’t be applied to a life. Twelve people entered Transformers. Eleven people returned.</p>
 <p>“He really died…” Zheng slowly calmed down. He sat down on the floor and murmured to himself. “Gando… doesn’t have a chance to revive anymore. He really died.” That was when he suddenly remembered everyone else in the team didn’t have a chance to revive anymore. They all died once already.</p>
 <p>“Is it because it has been too long since anyone died?” Xuan’s indifferent voice came through. He recovered to his normal look. He looked to Zheng calmly. “What do you think this place is? A vacation home? Do you want to spend some points and take a vacation? Stop kidding me. This is God’s realm. What made you believe that people don’t die? Have you forgotten how many people have died? Do you think we can do what we want in the movies after we became strong?”</p>
 <p>Xuan’s words were always sharp and blunt. It was not because he was cruel. That was how he thought. You couldn’t expect someone who didn’t care about his own life to care about others’ lives.</p>
 <p>“Yeah… he’s dead.” Zheng sighed. He stood up and patted off the dust on his shirt. His head remained low as he said. “Life is so fragile… It really has been too long before someone died. I thought we could all live on, at least until we return to the real world… I was too naive.” He quietly walked to his room.</p>
 <p>It was noon of the next day when Zheng appeared again. The team gathered on the platform as was customary. Once all members arrived, they would discuss future plans concerning exchanges and the next movie. It had always been this way. However, Zheng’s depressed look made everyone worried. They thought he would remain depressed for a few days. But he came out the next day.</p>
 <p>“Please. Do you wish for me to stay depressed?” Zheng glanced over the team. “You can’t let memories drag you down for your whole life. I am sad not only because a comrade died but also that the belief I have been holding onto shattered. But I haven’t given up on this belief. We will live Gando’s portion for him. Let us all make it back to the real world alive. Wouldn’t that be better?” He then looked to Xuan.</p>
 <p>Xuan and HongLu were discussing the AllSpark that they brought back from Transformers. No one else understood what they were talking about.</p>
 <p>“Ahem. Leave the theories for later. Xuan, I have a question. You mentioned that because of our increased rating, we are going to enter an extremely difficult movie. I just looked at our next movie. It’s A Nightmare On Elm Street 3. This is unfortunately a movie that can’t be explained with science. It has been so long since we were given such a genre. So you are right. The next movie is going to be really dangerous.” Zheng said.</p>
 <p>Xuan nodded. But then HongLu spoke before he opened his mouth. “That’s for certain. This is the same conclusion I reached. So get rid of your carefree attitude. In fact, we were still walking near the edge of hell prior to The Lord of the Rings. The next movie could bring us back to when Zhang Jie was with us… No one is safe. This is God’s balance. With each death, our strength would lower and so would our rating… If possible, let the newbies all die in each movie. This will lower our rating slightly, or at least we won’t see an increase.”</p>
 <p>Zheng’s face twitched but he couldn’t say what he wanted. “We can leave this for next time. Xuan, are these the AllSpark’s pieces? Do they have any use?”</p>
 <p>Xuan threw a thumb size piece to Zheng. God’s voice sounded in his mind as he touched the piece.</p>
 <p>“Spatial energy converter piece. Able to supply energy after repair.”</p>
 <p>“Spatial energy converter? What’s that?” Zheng asked with curiosity. “Isn’t it called the AllSpark?”</p>
 <p>Xuan nodded. “I was suspicious of the truth behind the AllSpark since watching the original Transformers movie. It involves quantum theory. It’s a waste of time to explain given your intelligence and knowledge…”</p>
 <p>Aside from HongLu, everyone else was staring at Xuan with glimmering eyes. They were obviously interested to hear the content as a story. It wouldn’t be boring as long as they didn’t have to study.</p>
 <p>“Fine. I will put it in simple words. Physics is separated into two fields. In classical physics, if I hit you with my fist, both you and my fist will feel pain, except at different degrees of pain. This is the theory of relativity. There’s also the law of conservation of mass and energy. The other is quantum physics, which challenged our prior understanding of the world. The universe is more complex and mysterious than we imagined. In quantum physics, my fist will not come into contact with your body. There’s a force in the atomic and molecular level that repels the two objects. The mass-energy equivalence invalidated mass and energy conservation.” Xuan said to the team.</p>
 <p>Zheng waved his hand and said. “What does this have to do with the infinite energy of the AllSpark? And what is that spatial energy converter referring to?”</p>
 <p>“Mortal’s wisdom.” Xuan sneered. “Keep listening. You won’t comprehend what’s coming next without hearing those words. There’s a hypothesis in quantum theory and special relativity that energy exists in empty space. Space itself might be a form of matter. This matter can be converted to energy and the energy determined the balance of our universe. Using the mass-energy equivalence equation, a space the size of a hydrogen atom when converted to energy contains more energy than all the mass within 200 lightyears combined. Which means whoever holds the technology to convert space into energy, or simply, whoever controls energy… can create worlds, creatures, or even the universe…</p>
 <p>“In fact, the Lambda Driver and the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception could be explained through the causality of quantum physics… This realm and everything in the exchange system is the embodiment of the highest level of science.”</p>
