 <h3>Vol 15 Chapter 1-3</h3>
 <p></p>
 <p>By the time everyone came out from their rooms, the whole team stood under God. Each person obtained different amount of points and ranked rewards. Xuan and Gando got the most. The two people they killed were unlocked members and they killed a lot of bugs. They both got 13000 points and two rank B rewards. Lan got 1000 points less than them. Everyone was going to get a big increase in strength after the movie. They chatted with excitement and smiles. Zheng could even notice a hint of being relaxed from Xuan.</p>
 <p>“Ahem. We have great earnings this time.” Zheng said with a laughter. “The points aside, each of us got at least a rank B reward and some even got two. Ranked rewards are what’s valuable. We can revive more comrades this time and enhance ourselves. About the revivals, we need to discuss it.”</p>
 <p>Xuan said his decision. “I have decided to revive three people this movie. They are Yinkong, Heng, and ChengXiao. The distribution of points is each of us aside from Zero contribute 4000 points, then Lan, Gando and I will also contribute a rank B reward. Everyone wouldn’t use too many points and still have a rank B reward left. As for Zero’s two rank B rewards, you can enhance yourself and give the remaining to the revived members.”</p>
 <p>The others calculated his proposal. Zheng would have 8000 points left and his rewards remained the same amount. That would be enough for a slightly lower tier sword technique. They would also revive three members that main combat and most importantly, a doctor. This was better than he expected.</p>
 <p>Zheng nodded. “Then it’s decided. Their strengths are what the team needed most. We will wait until after the next movie to revive HongLu and the other members. Everyone rest a day or two then we will enter The Mummy. After the revives, we will decide on our exchanges. How’s it?”</p>
 <p>Kampa laughed. “This is going to be incredible. I don’t even know what weapon to get with a rank B reward. I checked a few sci-fi weapons that require rank B rewards and their powers were almost scary.”</p>
 <p>The others laughed along. Zheng said. “As long as it’s powerful. However, you also need to enhance your werewolf bloodline as we go into more difficult movies and team battles.”</p>
 <p>Kampa seemed excited as Zheng mentioned the werewolf bloodline. He had doused himself in his imagination and howled. They further discussed and decided it was best to enter The Mummy tomorrow. Everyone would exchange ten days, which were only 500 points. That would give them a buffer if anything happened.</p>
 <p>The whole team felt exhausted after Starship Troopers. Several big battles one after another, the battle of wits against the two teams and escaping from the sea of bugs made them feel exhausted once everything was over. They stayed in their rooms that afternoon. Some slept, some played. Kampa grabbed Zero and WangXia to play video games. Lan sang and cook in her room. Xuan analyzed engineering designs. Gando pondered on what to exchange.</p>
 <p>Zheng also took a break. He brought Lori to the basement for fishing. The little girl leaned by his side quietly. It was rarely for her to get so quiet and this made her seem cute. Zheng couldn’t help and kissed her multiple times.</p>
 <p>The passed in this peaceful atmosphere. The next morning, they all stood on the platform without a word. Nothing dangerous should happen in The Mummy this time so even Gando didn’t exchange his robot before entering.</p>
 <p>“But why do you need a rank D reward?” Gando asked before entering.</p>
 <p>Zheng scratched his head and said. “Right, I forgot you haven’t entered this world. Don’t you have two rank B rewards? Split up one of them for a rank D reward. It’s just a rank D, not that much.”</p>
 <p>Gando replied immediately. “But I am already giving one rank B reward to revive team members. If I use up another rank D reward, I won’t have enough for the new robot after we come back. I have been eyeing the VF-1 Valkyrie for so long. It takes a rank B reward to exchange!”</p>
 <p>Zheng exhaled. “Okay then. I have an extra rank D reward. I will just exchange it for you so you can get the new robot.”</p>
 <p>Xuan stopped him then looked to Gando. It gave Gando chills all over.</p>
 <p>Xuan said calmly. “It isn’t a big deal giving you the rank D reward. The problem is every person can only give one other person points or rewards once. If Zheng give you the rank D reward here, he won’t be able to give you 4000 points later. It’s up to you to decide. Either use up a rank D reward or give 4000 more points. It will only be fair this way or our plan might have to change and doesn’t allow us to revive these three members.”</p>
 <p>Gando paused then looked at the others. They nodded quietly. He felt reluctant. 4000 points could give him enough stats to improve his physical prowess to another level. However, the Valkyrie was more agile, more powerful and had more defense. A rank D reward was so valuable at this point. He pondered for a long while then bit his teeth. “I understand. I will revive a member by myself. That robot only needs 5000 points. I have 13000 points. However, the robot’s weapons will need extra points. Zheng, you have to help me get some weapons like Gatling guns and missiles. Okay?”</p>
 <p>Zheng nodded without hesitation. “No problem. That’s it then. I will get the weapons for your robot.”</p>
 <p>Gando nodded with difficulty. However, he also seemed relieved.</p>
 <p>Zheng pulled Lan’s hand then pointed at Xuan. Lan connected them with Soul Link.</p>
 <p>Zheng immediately asked. “The contribution to revival doesn’t count in the one-time limit in God’s dimension. Why did you have to lie to him? Wouldn’t that create a gap between him and the team?”</p>
 <p>Xuan smiled. “The more you give to something, the more you feel responsible for it. If he doesn’t give anything to the team, he could abandon this team that he invested no effort into. Strength would be his only factor in decisions. He might even betray the team for his life. However, once this team contained a lot of his effort, he would feel reluctant on giving up what he had invested. Get it? Favors are not the only thing to retain people. Responsibility can also do so.”</p>
 <p>Zheng felt a lot better. These words showed that Xuan wasn’t out there to get Gando killed. He was helping Gando become a part of the team. This was a good sign. He trusted Xuan’s ability. Gando could be part of the team as long as Xuan was willing.</p>
 <p>“Okay! Let’s go and revive our comrades!”</p>
