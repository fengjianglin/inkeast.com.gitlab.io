 <p>“That’s basically the situation. Ahem. Why did I copy that icy man? Anyway, this is Xuan’s plan. We have to choose whether we want to proceed with it.” Haotian smiled.</p>
 <p>The other four people gave him a weird expression. Gando said. “What do you mean we can choose? Do you have anything against the man? We are of course going to proceed with his plan. The plan seems like it has a high chance of success too. Why are you asking such question?”</p>
 <p>“Asking such a question?” Haotian giggled. He seemed to find it funny. After some time, he said. “You seem to trust Xuan a lot. I never thought someone like him would be worth other people’s trust. Aren't you afraid of him scheming you to death?”</p>
 <p>Zero and the two others didn’t express anything. Gando said with empathy. “Now that you mention it, it seems that there is indeed a higher chance of him scheming us. Are you a victim too?”</p>
 <p>Haotian acted as if he had found his soul mate. He grabbed Gando’s hands. “Yes. Did he also scheme against you? Haha. You lucky bastard. You’re still alive. Another scourge is born. Haha. Ahem. I mean that everyone understands an officer on the battlefield doesn’t necessarily have to comply with the general. We don’t have to really follow Xuan’s plan to ambush Isen… snipe Saruman.”</p>
 <p>Zero said. “You haven’t finishing telling us his plan. Sci-fi weapons have no effect in this world. If we were to snipe Saruman, Heng would be more useful unless there’s a way to let me use the Gauss sniper rifle. Otherwise, I won’t be of much use.”</p>
 <p>Haotian brought out a red, long, and slender bullet from his pocket with a smile. It was about the length of a man’s finger. This was a high explosive Gauss sniper bullet except the symbols carved on the shell. They could faintly notice a green light flew along the symbols.</p>
 <p>“Xuan gave this to me. He said the bullet can damage movie characters. However, if Saruman used a barrier, we will have to depend on the Eyes of Death Perception.” Haotian laughed. He opened his arms like a salesperson and the people in front were the fools. “What do you think of the plan? Why do we have to complete such a difficult mission? Why don’t we follow a new plan?”</p>
 <p>Zero said. “We would rather believe in Xuan instead of believing in you. At least he was never wrong. He had never done anything wrong since I met him, even though he schemes his team. How do you make us trust you, newcomer? How can you convince use to abandon a correct plan and choose one that might be wrong? Even though Xuan assigned you as the leader of this group, it doesn’t mean you surpass him in intelligence.”</p>
 <p>Haotian nodded. “You are not wrong. Let us have a bet. If I win, you will follow my plan. If I lose, we will follow Xuan’s plan and I will take on the responsibility of leading you.”</p>
 <p>The four of them looked at each other. Zero asked. “A bet on what?”</p>
 <p>“Fight. The four of you against me. You can use any weapon aside from Gando going on flight mode with his robot. You can kill me or permanently disable me but I can’t kill you or cause permanent injury to you. I can only subdue you.” Haotian looked at them with seriousness.</p>
 <p>Zheng handed them the storage bag before they split up. Xuan also gave WangXia a small energy storage device the size of a fist. It could only store about thirty percent of Zheng’s Qi but that much was enough to activate the storage bag. WangXia still hadn’t cultivated his own Qi but he could drain the Qi from the device and use it temporarily. The bag had all their weapons, a robot, a Gauss sniper rifle, a Gattling cannon, plasma grenades, mines, and timed bombs.</p>
 <p>They naturally had to avoid fighting in front of the other veterans and newbies. A few days later when the group came to a never-ending grassy field, the five people from team China made up an excuse and went away into a mountain valley.</p>
 <p>“My plan is quite simple. We follow the first half of Xuan’s plan to snipe Saruman. However, we won’t meet up with their group afterward. Xuan wants us to kill Saruman then inject virus into Saruman’s orcs to turn them into Nemesis. We would then bring these Nemesis to back the team up. But no! There’s a critical flaw to this plan. The influence we have at that point would overlap.” Haotian sat on the ground and said.</p>
 <p>Kampa, WangXia, and Zero had bruises all over their faces. Gando was lying on the ground convulsing, frothing from his mouth. Haotian was the only person unharmed.</p>
 <p>“Based on my understanding of Xuan, he would definitely try to get his hands on the knights of Rohan. So even if we head over with the orcs, the addition wouldn’t change the situation too much. We would be better off doing something else…”</p>
 <p>Gando wiped the bubbles off his mouth. “Like? Have you come up with what exactly you want to do?”</p>
 <p>“Of course!” Haotian smiled. He crushed a piece of rock with his hand. “Incorporate Saruman’s orcs into our forces. Then transform them to Nemesis. I mean to transform them en masse. We only need a thousand Nemesis equipped with weapons and armour. This army would be powerful enough to rival an army of fifty thousand orcs. My plan is to ambush team East America and team Celestial from behind. We will be the other group’s saviours. We will be the trump card of team China.”</p>
 <p>Tampa rubbed the bruises on his face. He asked. “Didn’t Xuan only produce eighty portions of the virus? How are you going to make a thousand Nemesis?”</p>
 <p>Haotian laughed. “You are underestimating that man too much. How can there be only one plan when it’s him? Those eight portions were produced in God’s dimension. But, he has several hundred portions cultivating right now. This isn’t a greenhouse like God’s dimension so the reproduction rate goes down. However, the T virus in the storage bag will finish reproduction by the time we reach Isengard. We may even end up with a surplus of T virus. Anyway, there will be at least five hundred portions. Haha.”</p>
 <p>“That’s basically the situation. Isn’t it interesting?” Xuan sat in front of Zheng and said.</p>
 <p>Zheng was stunned with his eyes and mouth wide open. He pointed at Xuan but Xuan continued eating his fruit as nothing was wrong. It took Zheng a while before he could speak. “But how could they ambush Isengard with just the few of them? That’s running straight to the enemy base with a white wizard in garrison.”</p>
 <p>Xuan nodded. “There won’t be an issue. A normal person’s vision can only reach several thousand meters. He can’t even notice an object the size of him at that distance. And even if he does, it would be merely a small dot. The Gauss sniper rifle has a range of tens of thousands of meters. Zero simply has to stay over ten thousand meters away. His enhanced vision allows him to succeed at this range. As long as they follow my plan, Saruman’s death is inevitable. Even if Saruman survives, they could easily escape with the distance. You don’t have to worry about them.”</p>
 <p>Zheng had no choice but to nod. “Fine. We don’t have to worry about them like you said. But I still don’t understand what’s interesting? You have made similar plans in the past. What makes you happy about this one?”</p>
 <p>Xuan smiled lightly. “Because Haotian won’t come to support us with the eighty Nemesis as I requested. Based on his personality and behavior, he will request cooperation from Zero and the others. They will incorporate the remaining orcs under Saruman and transform them into Nemesis. The T virus I put in the storage bag is still cultivating. They will mature in thirty days. Haotian should have made this decision by now. That’s what’s interesting. The other four people aren’t familiar with him. So there will be an argument between them. Haotian will use this opportunity to establish his status in the group. That’s the interesting thing.”</p>
 <p>Zheng was still confused. “Why? Why do you want him to establish status in the group?”</p>
 <p>“To bribe people over…”</p>
 <p>Before Xuan could finish talking, a female elf walked down the stairs. She was Galadriel, the lady of Lorien.</p>
