 <p> <a href="/announcement/physician-s-odyssey-out-of-sneak-peek">Read More...</a> </p> 
</div>
<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>A height of almost two thousand metres. It wasn’t that tall, nor was it that short. Still, it was enough for ordinary fleshy bodies to fall to their deaths. Even Zheng with his body would die without a sliver of doubt if he fell from that height. So, he had to finish the Balrog before he fell back down!</p> 
 <p>The two figures looked extremely imbalanced. Even after Dragon Transformation, Zheng’s build still seemed like the size of a rat before that over ten metres tall Balrog. It was only that this rat had shocking power and actually wanted to tear the person into pieces. That was the current portrayal of Zheng and the Balrog. After Dragon Transformation, Zheng did indeed have sufficient strength to rip the Balrog apart by the waist.</p> 
 <p>The Balrog howled in pain. Its hands begun to pound at Zheng, who was at its waist. It didn't even care about its flaming demonic sword dropping away. Perhaps because of the critical moment of life and death, the blazing white flames covering its whole body shone and it couldn't be looked at directly, as if it were the sun. That sun fell towards the ground at high speed and all that could be heard in the area were the Balrog and Zheng’s yells.</p> 
 <p>Zheng ignored that enormous force on his back. He only focused on using his hands to rip the Balrog apart. His hands felt like they were immersed in magma and although he was using Qi and Blood Energy to resist this heat and his Red Flame never stopped, the heat was still unblockable and invaded his body. It scorched his skin, wrecked his muscles, boiled his blood and destroyed his bones…</p> 
 <p>He was practically sure that the Balrog’s body temperature had reached several tens of thousands degrees Celsius. Perhaps even he wouldn’t be able to endure this if his Red Flame didn't have the effect of resisting high temperatures. “If so, I can't let you go! My comrades are up above! How could I let you monsters go to the upper floors? Go die!”</p> 
 <p>Zheng had been beaten into a frenzy. He opened his mouth and madly gave the Balrog’s stomach a bite. He used force to pull. Ignoring not only the flames and high temperature, but also his instantly vaporized high temperature blood, he actually then stuck his hand into the Balrog’s stomach. With another forceful tug, the Balrog’s entire intestine was pulled out.</p> 
 <p>At the same time, Zheng’s hand that was holding Tiger’s Soul let go. As Tiger’s Soul fell, his legs hooked it. The entire Tiger Soul flew up, piercing the Balrog’s stomach…</p> 
 <p>All this occurred in but an instant. Only a second or two had passed, and as the Balrog wretchedly bellowed, Zheng grit his teeth and forcefully pulled, tearing the gap in the stomach open. Then, his entire figure entered…</p> 
 <p>(Live, battle… Battle in order to live! I will never die here!)</p> 
 <p>“GO DIE!’</p> 
 <p>Zheng infused Magic into Tiger’s Soul. in an instant, that enormous pressure appeared once again. The Balrog gave a howl and its body began disintegrating inch by inch from the middle, finally completely becoming ashes. It all dispersed in the air. Zheng flew in the sky with a flap of his wings, only at a height of a few hundred metres as of now. His entire body had been charred black all over, with that hand that had stretched into the Balrog especially having been burnt to the bones. Zheng was holding Tiger’s Soul with just a single hand now.</p> 
 <p>“Then, it’s time to destroy the blood cocoon…” Zheng exhaled. Just as he was about about to initiate the attack on the cocoon, his body began trembling.</p> 
 <p>(No, it’s not my body trembling, but the surrounding space itself. An earthquake? How could I feel an earthquake in midair? Is the surrounding airflow violently trembling?) Zheng could only feel as if there were various mini tornados in existence around him. He could feel the trembling even while flying in the air and before he could understand what was going on, an enormous pressure leapt up from the cocoon below. The pressure was shocking, and if the pressure of Tiger’s Soul was used as a comparison, it would be ten or a hundred times that!</p> 
 <p>(It’s hatching. This appearance…) In the instant Zheng saw the appearance of the monster, his mind sensed a violent fluctuation. He sensed this fluctuation with complete clarity, but he wasn’t able to block it. In the next moment, he had entered that sleepy state of being half dreaming and half awake.</p> 
 <p>(I sense it! Energy! As I near the fifth stage, even God’s energy can be sensed…) This was Zheng’s realization as he entered the half-dreaming half-sleeping state.</p> 
 <p>Time, the Grand Primordial War… The war between Saints and Cultivators had already spread to the outer space surrounding Earth, with the shockwaves even hitting Mars. The war was so vast that humanity’s prehistoric civilisations were annihilated overnight. A large majority of Saints and Cultivators perished in the war. The remainders of the two sides couldn’t not search for fresh battle power for their factions. Cultivators had some avoid Heavenly Tribulation to speedily become Loose Immortals, while the Saints had some Saints forcefully breakthrough to the fifth stage, designated as Fiends…</p> 
 <p>But there were benefits as well as drawbacks. Loose Immortals would never improve again. Although the Heavenly Tribulation was avoided, it would continuously build up, until it would one day erupt when it had accumulated to its limit. Thus, it could also be called a failed product. <br> Fiends had great power, but they had never truly entered the class of Saints. They couldn’t possess the energy manipulation abilities of the true fifth stage. So, when they exhibited great power and energy, Fiends would slowly degrade until the point their mentality was completely dominated by their instincts. They would become a biological weapon that would massacre anywhere and everywhere. They too, were failed products.</p> 
 <p>The brutality of the Grand Primordial War made countless quasi-Saints and quasi-Cultivators become failed products. The war entered its final stages under the impetus of the instantaneous killing power of these failed products. Heaven and Earth were rend apart, civilisation came to an end.</p> 
 <p>Zheng abruptly awoke, realizing he had just begun to drop. The words before should have only taken a second. However, the meaning of those words, paired with the appearance of the monster before him…</p> 
 <p>“Seven heads, nine horns, a snake’s body and human faces. Isn’t this how Satan is described in the Bible? I read the Bible once and still remember a bit of the description of Satan.” Zheng took out the metal plate and said cautiously.</p> 
 <p>There was a giant crimson serpent two hundred metres in size in the cocoon. It had seven giant heads and an extra superfluous mouth at its chest and back. Each mouth had an enormous horn next to it. The difference the seven heads had was that they had seven indistinct human faces. The faces looked seventy percent similar to humans, but with some abnormalities. It was a giant monster like a small mountain, with a pressure not even Zheng dared disregard. Accurately speaking, even Zheng was stunned by this pressure.</p> 
 <p>“Satan… or perhaps to say, Great Fiend Xiangliu. In our country’s mythology, the mythos regarding Xiangliu also have this appearance. Perhaps, Satan of Western mythology and some ancient monsters of our country can all considered to be fifth stage Saints who suffered a backlash. The genes in their body have gone out of control, finally becoming the appearance we see before us. Perhaps, a large majority of ancient demons were a product of the Grand Primordial War. Based on the information just obtained, this guess’s probability is eighty percent.” Xuan’s voice passed through.</p> 
 <p>Zheng exhaled, and said after a long time, “God can create even fifth stage Saints, or accurately speaking, Saints?”</p> 
 <p>“Impossible.” Xuan directly denied it. "This could be Satan’s or Xiangliu’s true body. It was arranged or sealed in God’s Realm long ago just like the prototype God we encountered. It’s specially to appear as a guardian when we approach information regarding the truth. Zheng, you need to persevere for five minutes. When the time comes, you can come out and I’ll use the Magic Cannon to destroy the capital!”</p> 
 <p>“I’ll try my best.” Zheng no longer scolded Xuan, instead calmly drawing a breath, before looking at the enormous motionless creature below.</p> 
 <p>He had never encountered a pressure like that of this monster, not even in Resident Evil Apocalypse when he met his clone. It was like when an ordinary person looked up at Mt.Tai, where one only felt the unshakeability of the monster. This feeling was unspeakably terrible.</p> 
 <p>(Five minutes? Can I delay for so long?) Zheng continuously breathed deeply. He had never been as tense as he was now since overcoming his heart’s devil. No, this wasn’t tenseness. This should belong to the category of fear. It was that unstoppable terror when meeting a higher life form, like when an ant looked up at a human! “Dammit! Satan? Xiangliu? A failed product of the fifth stage?”</p> 
 <p>Zheng, carrying Tiger’s Soul, began to howl, “COME! Unless you kill me, don’t EVEN think of going up!”</p> 
 <p>The seven heads of the previously motionless monster rose at the same time, as it heard Zheng’s howls. They all looked at Zheng, who was in mid air. A human’s body was simply just too small compared to that over two hundred metres body. The seven heads seemed to respond to Zheng’s provocation and howled at the same time. Runes visible to the eyes appeared in the surroundings of the monster, and they begun appearing out of thin air through energy usage…</p> 
 <p>What occured within the Abyss was not known to outsiders. The only one who knew was Xuan, that uncommunicative, unfeeling, unexpressive man. Thus, the rest of team China continued to take their own steps to complete their missions. Zero and Heng arrived in the airspace above the capital. Imhotep and Yingkong were protecting the elf princess Arya as she gathered all the villagers in the villagers. Xuan and Wangxia were standing high above the capital, the Magic Cannon displayed before them…</p> 
 <p>And, on Eragon’s side, the two young dragons seemed to have some sort of special reaction…</p>
