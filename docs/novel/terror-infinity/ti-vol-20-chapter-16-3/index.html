All traces of Zheng’s training could no longer be found, and all that was left was peace and quiet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xuan was standing not far behind Zheng. He indifferently bit at an apple in his hand. This man didn’t reply Zheng’s question, only sitting there and minding his own business as he ate the apple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“...Don’t bite at your apple anymore. Please, you can’t taste anything anyways. I’m talking about an important matter now. The final battle is near. Before that, I must be as strong as my clone, or at least have the power to fight with him. Otherwise, our team China…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xuan listened, and finally stopped biting the apple. He instead spoke out. “Have you already understood the gap between you and your clone?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Gap?” Zheng was preparing to take offense at first, but he instead entered contemplation upon hearing Xuan say this. “The gap in power doesn’t need to be said. I feel that the greatest gap between us is in ideology. Although we are the same person, we have both undergone completely different experiences. We are at completely different positions. No. His ideology belongs to that of an extreme darkness. That is why for the me who stands in the sunlight, I am unable to understand his thinking.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But!”</span></p>

He inhaled deeply. “I may not understand his thinking, but I can understand his pain. The more powerful he becomes, the more he is unable to die, which is the source of his pain… If I didn’t feel it wrongly, he seems to be finding a release. But he keeps becoming more and more powerful as he cannot find this release, and is more and more unable to find this release the stronger he gets. In this way, he will be in more pain, and this pain never stops… I will find this release for him!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xuan smiled coldly. “What a violent logic. You think he’s in pain, so would the other side definitely accept your release? Don’t joke. If the final battle begins, your strength is wholly unable to act as a chess piece to deal with your clone. Why not spare a thought for me? Raise your strength, and let me make more effective schemes. Don’t just prattle on here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zheng patted him heavily. “So… I need to become strong… If I lose in ideology to my clone from the start, then I need to at least catch up to him in strength, or surpass him. This is something I must do… Although there should completely be no problems with Destruction letting me oppose the clone from Resident Evil Apocalypse, I don’t believe he hasn’t had a slight improvement after such a long time. And based on what we know, that man seems to have become extremely powerful, to a terrifying stage. That is why similarly, I need a similarly terrifying power to fight with him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Actually… the belief in your heart won’t necessarily lose to the hatred in his heart. It’s just that you haven't figured it out yet…” Xian expressionlessly finished eating the apple, before continuing. “What kind of power? Do you want to use the Magic Cannon to bombard the other teams?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zheng shook his head. “Impossible. God will definitely restrict this type of weapon in the final battle. Wouldn’t the final battle be child’s play otherwise? So I estimate that the Magic Cannon won’t be usable in the final battle. That’s the first thing. Secondly… it is an insult to him if that kind of weapon is used on him. The one to battle him can only be me. And I must do it personally. No person nor power can interfere. It is my duty to end him personally… If we must talk about some kind of power, there is one in my heart.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m not the type that uses techniques, nor a combatant that uses wisdom. I merely want to live on, and not alone. Live on together with everyone else. That’s why I understand even more the sorrow and pain in his heart. I can’t end him with technique or wisdom, and can only do so with the strongest power. Without technique or fancy theatrics, the sole power I can use to rival him… Chaos! Genesis Splitter! That is the name I gave this move.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Genesis began with Chaos, then split apart. The light rose to become the Heavens and the heavy sank down to form the Earth. If the two meet again, it will once again become Chaos, causing that event of Genesis Splitting once again… Chaotically mix together Refined Qi and Magic, and let them collide intensely at my heart. The energy thus produced is what causes the might of the Magic Cannon, and is the source of my newly created move…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zheng clenched his fist, then continued speaking. “I don’t know the might of using this power. I also don’t know whether my body can bear the backlash of this attack. It’s never been tested before after all. I want to test the might of this move every time, but haven't had any suitable chances. Or if I suddenly burst like a balloon, wouldn’t other teams laugh to death? Anyways, I need to find a good time to try it out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then… I’ll create the chance for you to test out this move. Just a single time, so properly grasp it…” Xuan nodded, then said indifferently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Good! Give me the chance to try this move. Just don’t let me die! I can’t die, as the me now has a reason to live on, which is why I can’t die!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">(...I remember telling him before that I can’t die yet. Is this his answer? Damn it, Xuan!)</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zheng looked dumbly at that energy beam getting closer and closer. If it was just him alone, he could definitely dodge it in his current Chaos, Genesis Splitter state. But could the current him dodge it? If the chosen team leader was him, then the entire team China would really be wiped out. But if he forcefully bore it, and Xuan’s calculations were wrong, then they would definitely...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Forget it! I’ll trust him!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zheng had already shut his eyes. His body at this moment was already in a wretched state. The majority of his meridians had already been torn to pieces. If he didn’t receive treatment, he would still die within minutes even with his body constitution. This was still with the prerequisite that he didn’t use this energy. If he used this energy again, it would no longer need a few minutes. Within just ten seconds that he would die horribly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">(I’m still an organic lifeform after all. I can’t use this power only those Immortals and Devils of legends could use. No, even Immortals and Devils shouldn’t be able to use this power. Too terrifying. The powerful body of the Dragon Transformation can’t even last thirty seconds? &nbsp;The damage this time definitely isn’t the breakdown of body, but also of the genes. The most fundamental elements of my body aren’t able to withstand the backlash of excessively powerful energy…)</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zheng closed his eyes and silently contemplated his worries. After a long time, the expected pain and sense of loss never came. When he opened his eyes, that beam of light had stopped not far from him. The surroundings had also come to a standstill, including his comrades and Julian, whose eyes were wide open. Not only that, but the wounds on his body had also stopped. There was no longer that unbearable pain, and it also stopped worsening. In short, everything in the surroundings had stopped, apart from him. No. A sphere of light was excluded as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A sphere of light had appeared where Yang Xuelin had been lying before. Yang Xuelin herself had disappeared completely. Or, perhaps it would be more accurate to say she had changed from a human body to the likeness of a sphere of light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Member of team China who has faced the test. I am team China’s Guide. Only you are suitable for the duty of team leader in this team. After you completed my test, the horror movie has been completed. Next is your choice; do you wish to become the leader of team China? At that time you will receive a portion of the authority over God’s Realm and a full body repair. Are you willing?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A voice abruptly sounded in Zheng’s mind, akin to that of God’s voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zheng exhaled a breath, before finally asking a question. “Does that refer to this horror movie directly ending, or the end of my battle in this horror movie?” This was a question related to all the team members, and was also what Zheng was most worried about at the moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The entire movie world will directly end. Are you willing to become the team leader?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing those words, Zheng’s mental state relaxed. Only now did he have the chance to think about whether he would become the team leader. This was the source of Xuan’s scheme and plan. Jie had once spoken about the situation regarding becoming the leader of team China. As long as one passed the Guide’s test, then the horror movie would end in an instant. As for how to pass the test without displays of strength or potential, and why Xuan would wait until this moment to fire the Magic Cannon? The battles before were all just chances for the Guide to test everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">(It looks like Xuan’s plan worked. When the Guide determines who the leader is, and that person encounters life threatening danger, the entire movie world will be stopped… Most likely, apart from the mind still being able to work, everything else will stop moving. Jie really died an unjust death that time. A Nightmare on Elm Street solely has mental backlash, and no other types of harm. As long the mind doesn’t stop or is unable to break through, the damage will remain. That’s why he died after becoming the team leader…)</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, Zheng more or less knew what the heart’s devil of the Xuan’s was. The so called heart’s devil, was when the more someone obsessed over something, the more it would turn into a heart’s devil. For example, Zheng desired freedom, so his heart’s devil was a boundary of freedom. What Xuan wanted the most were feelings, and everybody were people who could evoke his emotions. His heart’s devil should thus likely to be annihilating all his comrades...</span></p>
