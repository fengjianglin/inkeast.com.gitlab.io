 <p><span style>Chapter 28: Unparalleled Glory</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandmother, this granddaughter greets you.” Qin Yining didn’t dare overstep herself and paused to kneel on the ground in the grand ceremony of greeting. The rest of her group shifted to the sides to avoid blocking her gesture. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The duchess looked at her with even more tender eyes and helped Qin Yining up with both hands. She patted her granddaughter’s hand with pity. “Good girl, there’s no need to stand on such ceremony. Let me take a good look at you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The duchess’ hand had the dry warmth that was unique to elderly folk. Tears welled up in Qin Yining’s eyes when she felt the heat, which in turn made the duchess melt. There were some people who shared enough destiny to know that they liked the other on first sight. This was precisely how the duchess felt about Qin Yining at their first meeting. The calluses and scars on the girl’s hand pained the older woman. </span></p>
 <p><span style>She gathered Qin Yining in her arms and patted her on the back, saying in a choked up voice, “Poor girl, you’ve had a rough life all these years.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those words tugged at Qin Yining’s heart, so much so that her tears couldn’t help but plop soundlessly downwards. This warm hug and the faint smell of incense from the duchess were touching her in the deepest part of her heart. She strove mightily to keep her emotions in check, desperately fighting the urge to burst into sobs at this joyous occasion. “Don’t be sad grandmother. No matter how things were before, it’s all over now. We should look ahead to the future, not behind.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>These words were the perfect response. The duchess nodded several times. “Yes, indeed, it’s over, all over now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The senior and second madame had long been dabbing at their eyes from emotion. They nodded continuously, and even née Sun, having experienced extreme highs and lows since finding her daughter, burst in tears. The scene of them holding each other and bawling in the cold wind was too tragic to bear. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The senior madame sniffled. “Look at mother being so happy, you even ran out of the house in your slippers, in </span><i><span style>this</span></i><span style> kind of weather! The ground’s quite cold.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bao-</span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style> was dabbing at her eyes with a sleeve and spoke up, “The elder madame was in such a hurry to see her granddaughter that she wouldn’t even let me help her into shoes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Me? You’re talking about me? And who was it that barely keep their seat?” The duchess poked fun at her two daughters-in-law. The heavy atmosphere was washed away with the banter, leaving behind only happiness as the group laughed and chatted with each other. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The crowd slowly filed into the house. Even the serving girl holding up the door curtains was wreathed with smiles, as if it was New Year’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Yining kept smiling through her tears as she listened to her grandmother and aunts trade words of comfort for her. She wasn’t able to get a word in edgewise. She’d fantasized about this scene many times on the way back to the capital from Liang, but to think that she’d find it at her grandmother’s instead of her own home! </span></p>
 <p><span style>The potential situations that could arise and various strategies that had kept her up late last night all seemed to be extraneous effort. It would seem that she’d simply been a worrywart and thought too little of her family. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The duchess was helped into the main seat by her two daughters-in-law, who then took the side seats along with née Sun. Bao-</span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style> brought over a rush cushion for Qin Yining to kneel down on and properly perform the grand ceremony of greeting. “This granddaughter greets grandmother and her two aunts, and hopes they are well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh hurry and rise.” The duchess leaned forward to help Qin Yining up and pulled the girl to sit beside her. “Have you gotten used to things since coming back? Do you lack anything? Your mother has a quick temper and is too forgetful. If she dares mistreat you, just tell grandmother. I’ll hit her for you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The duchess spoke very quickly, too quickly for Qin Yining to get a word in. She could only shake her head to indicate that she hadn’t been maltreated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mother, you’re playing favorites! Daughter Yi’s completely outshone me now that she’s here.” Née Sun blushed furiously at those words. She couldn’t help but recall that she had indeed hit the girl and criticized her quite harshly. Despite all this, the child had still graciously thought of retaining her mother’s dignity. Some guilt washed over Née Sun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And how old are you? Look at you still vying with your daughter! I won’t talk about your quick temper, but you should really use your brains more in the future. Don’t go every which way that people point you in.” The duchess tapped née Sun’s forehead with a finger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Color drained out of Qin Huining’s face. Her complexion was as white as paper as she lowered her head to surreptitiously observe the duchess’ expression. Née Sun leaned back and stuck out her tongue with a playful air. All of the girls chuckled, and the sounds of merrymaking traveled far into the distance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Qin Huining was quite apprehensive. She knew that her maternal grandmother was no easy character and wasn’t as easily manipulated as née Sun. There had been clear undertones to those words just now! </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That wild brat’s been the center of attention since we’ve arrived. Even grandmother sees only her, I’ve basically become nonexistent!</span></i><span style> Resentment had festered in Qin Huining the more this silent treatment continued, but all of it abruptly vanished in the wind after those words from the duchess, leaving behind only the panic of having lost favor. She hastily curtsied with a smile. “Grandmother is looking ever so well these days.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The duchess was smiling as she patted Qin Yining’s hand lightly. “Indeed, the days have easy for me. Your two aunts and cousins all wait on me hand and foot, leaving nothing for me to do. Your aunts take all the burdens onto their shoulders and won’t breathe a hint of any baseless rumors to me at all. So I can live unfettered by anything and can only play with my grandchildren. It’s impossible not to be in good health then, wouldn’t you say?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It felt like something had struck Qin Huining’s head as her face flushed red and purple. She forced a smile. “Grandmother has great fortune. Aunts and sister cousins are all filial, and uncles and brother cousins all have great accomplishments.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Indeed.” The duchess looked merrily at Qin Yining. “Our darling Yi had a rough childhood. Since you’ve come home, all of those disasters are water under the bridge. Only good days lay ahead, so darling Yi is someone with great fortune as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone agreed with smiles and laughter, breaking out into a hubbub of conversation again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Huining sulkily backed off to the side, her balled fists hidden in her sleeves. Her nails were digging so hard into her palms that they were almost drawing blood. She’d never thought that the duchess would deny her so much face and repeatedly knock her down! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Huining didn’t know if the others had understand the exchange, but née Sun likely had. She looked anxiously at née Sun, but saw her mother looking in the duchess and Qin Yining’s direction with a slight smile. Something had amused her, and she was chuckling happily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Perhaps feeling Qin Huining’s gaze on her, née Sun turned with a questioning look. Their gazes met, but Qin Huining wasn’t able to purge the vengeful resentment in her eyes in time. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Née Sun started and thought back to what her mother had said moments ago. She then thought of how Qin Huining had still been up to her old tricks in front of née Sun’s sisters earlier today. The madame really disliked Qin Huining’s behavior, so didn’t call the girl to her side for comfort like she usually would’ve. Née Sun turned back to continue chatting with her sisters-in-law.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>She ignored me!</span></i><span style> Qin Huining almost broke a tooth from gnashing them so hard. </span><i><span style>Now it’s really apparent who’s the real daughter and who’s not, huh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>These people were too twisted! Yes she’d been swapped and taken Qin Yining’s place for fourteen years. But how was any of that her fault?! She was a victim too! But here they were, all showing her unfriendly faces! </span><i><span style>They can’t blame me for fighting for what I want!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Elder Madame.” A head maid came in to curtsey with a smile. “His Grace and the senior master are back from morning court. Grand Supervisor Wang from the palace is also with them and says he brings an imperial decree! He has told us to all go accept the decree!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grand Supervisor Wang by the emperor’s side?” Amidst the suddenly quiet room, the duchess’ voice pitched a bit higher than usual.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, this servant has already asked the pageboy.” The head maid nodded. “His Grace and the senior master all look very happy, and the supervisor is being quite polite. His Grace has told all the young masters not to come to Bright Spring Hall, but to head for the main door to meet the supervisor and accept the decree.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I thought those kids were being a bit slow, so there’s some good news!” The second madame clapped once. “Mother, it’s most likely to do with the gentlemen of our family!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The duchess and senior madame were also guessing the same as joy blossomed on their faces. The entire house was mainstays in the fight against Great Zhou’s aggression, whether it was grandson Sun Haichen on the frontlines, second elder master Sun Haijing, or the mighty pen at court: Sun Yu. They were all sharp weapons for the emperor’s use. Now that Grand Supervisor Wang was here in person, he must have accolades to shower on one of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no time for chitchat as those with titles, such as the duchess, senior madame, second madame, and née Sun, all hastily put on formal makeup. The girls tidied themselves up and swiftly went to the front yard, burning incense to accept the decree. </span></p>
 <p><span style>It was Qin Yining’s first exposure to such a situation, so nerves inevitably bit at her. She was kneeling behind all of the women along with her cousins, listening to Grand Supervisor Wang’s shrill proclaimation. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Emperor, who governs with the mandate of Heaven, decrees that Sun Yu, a regular member of the Hanlin Academy, [1.</span><i><span style>The</span></i><span style> scholarly institute in ancient China], grandson of Duke of the State, Duke of Ding, is an open and upright individual, possessing both of talent and ethics, wholehearted devotion to public duty, free of corruption, and does not debase himself with crooked individuals. We are gratified with his loyalty and fidelity, and hereby promote him to an eminent member of the Hanlin Academy and award him with a hundred taels of gold. So it is decreed!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We thank His Imperial Majesty!” Everyone kowtowed in unison.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Supervisor Wang offered the imperial decree with both hands and a smile. “Congratulations, Sir Sun!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Many thanks to Grand Supervisor Wang.” Sun Yu accepted with both hands as well. “Please step into the parlor for some tea.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The duke rose with a smile. “Many thanks to the grand supervisor for making this trip. You must have a cup of my best tea before you return to the palace.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The grand supervisor smiled merrily and bowed. “Many thanks to Duke of Ding, this servant shall dispense with further pleasantries and comply.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This way please.” The duke and Sun Yu headed off to play host to the imperial servant, while the females and young masters returned to Bright Spring Hall. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The atmosphere grew lively again after everyone had changed into more comfortable clothing and washed off the heavy makeup.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh my my, what wonderful news! This is such great fortune!” Née Sun grabbed the senior madame’s hands. “You have such a fine son! He’s part of the cabinet at such an young age and has now climbed to become an esteemed member of Hanlin Academy by himself! He’s been complimented by the emperor himself! He’s the first in our family to receive such a unique honor!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The senior madame waved her hand with a smile. “Look at you piling the praise on, Ming’er was just lucky, and this time he did indeed do precisely what the emperor likes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone grew curious at these words. The duchess took the lead. “I was just wondering as well. Why did the emperor send Grand Supervisor Wang all of a sudden? Setting aside the promotion, why the reward of a hundred taels of gold?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Yining blinked with curiosity as well. Everyone said that the son of Heaven was hard to fathom, so it was quite rare that her eldest cousin would be so rewarded by the emperor.</span></p>
