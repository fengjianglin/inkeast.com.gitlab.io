 <p><span style>Chapter 21: Jealousy Inducing </span></p>
 <p><span style>In the main residence of Snowpear Courtyard, Zhan-</span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style> snuck a look at the burnt incense stick and nodded with a smile. “Miss, you’re Prime Minister Qin’s official firstborn alright! You’re indeed uncommonly smart and only need a hint before comprehension. You’ve learned this standing position quite well! You should be tired by now, why not rest a bit?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Many thanks to Zhan-</span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style>,” Qin Yining replied but didn’t allow her proper posture to lapse. Only her expression relaxed slightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The palace servant was even happier to see this. “You’re putting what you’ve learned into practice immediately. This shows a high degree of perception. Everyone understand rules and manners, but not everyone can execute them beautifully. What you need to do is to imprint these new habits into your bones. Make it so that every bone and muscle has these new memories. Only then will you gain a bearing that remains constant in the face of all changes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zhan-</span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style> speaks truly.” Qin Yining nodded quite seriously as she felt the same way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will thoroughly explain your every move and gesture in the future, whether when sitting, lying down, walking, every movement of your hand and feet, and every smile and frown. I will help you understand what feelings you induce in others with your motions and looks.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Yining blinked, trying to understand what the </span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style> had just said. Zhan-</span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style> couldn’t help but continue on when she saw the girl like this, “You’re a grown-up miss and will understand some things without me explaining them. For a noble daughter like you, your future entirely depends on the marriage you make. You have an exceedingly strong family background, so your future husband will be of a similar position.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is important to focus on the proficiency of your household duties, embroidery, character, and talents so that your in-laws like you. Interacting with others is a large part of life in these manors, so it’s vital that you honor your elders and coexist peacefully with the ladies. To precisely express a variety of thoughts with your motions, and to analyze others’ moods and mentalities from their mannerisms, isn’t something that everyone can learn. But you miss, can try to understand it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Yining looked at eyes full of gratitude when she heard this. It was the first time that someone had laid out her future so clearly since she’d returned to the manor. And yet, the person who’d done so wasn’t her mother, grandmother, or any female relative, but a </span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style> here to teach her rules and manners. She knew only that was the scope of the </span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style>’s responsibilities, the palace servant didn’t need to say all this to her. Qin Yining was quite thankful for this additional attention.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhan-</span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style> was quite delighted by Qin Yining’s limpid, expressive eyes. “Just like I can tell from the look in your eyes right now that you’re both happy and grateful—this is precisely what I mean. If you can use your own body language and be able to read that of others, you’ll have a much easier time in your future life. You might not have consciously thought all this through, but you’re already using the skills subconsciously. I can also sense your kind intentions.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A faint blush had appeared on Qin Yining’s face as she nodded, “I understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhan-</span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style> continued, “Rules and manners can actually be split apart into two concepts. Rules must be followed. Breaking them would make a fool out of yourself, or even invite fatal attention. Manners on the other hand, is the ability to make others feel comfortable when you interact with them. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“This doesn’t only cover gestures, but also words and tone in conversation, one’s outfit, colors used and others. During this time, this servant will go over the principles of wearing clothes with the miss, explaining how different color combinations will change the perception of others, and what accessories go with what outfits. This will help you understand a person from just what they’re wearing when you meet others in the future.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Therefore, when I see someone, they may be wearing something on purpose to lure in others or enhance a certain feeling they’re projecting? Or it could all be a purposeful act for me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Precisely, the miss is quite smart.” Zhan-</span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style>’s smile deepened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, this is due to the </span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style>’s care. I grew up in the countryside and mountains and have never been exposed to any of this. It’s also likely that no one will explain all this to me in such detail. I have learned greatly from your pointers. This will all help me immensely in the future.” Qin Yining performed a curtsey out of gratitude. “I will have to rely on Zhan-</span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style> in the future as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The </span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style> avoided accepting the girl’s gesture and returned a grand gesture as well. Although she was here on the empress’ orders, she truly liked and respected the young girl in front of her after an afternoon together. The palace servant felt that the Qin fourth miss was both sincere and adorable, without a hint of superficiality to her. Having served in the palace all these years, she’d seen all sorts of women. There had been beautiful ones and smart ones, but one that was so pleasing to her eye like Qin Yining was a first.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She never once had the feeling that Qin Yining was over-fawningly polite to the point where she lost her dignity as the prime minister’s daughter, but also never had the feeling that the girl was prideful and couldn’t be bothered to even speak to others. She had maintained their relationship at a comfortable distance, making someone as worldly as Zhan-</span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style> unable to keep from imparting some more knowledge to her. “The hour is growing late today and you must have other affairs to attend to, miss. This servant will take my leave now then.” Zhan-</span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style> rose with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Mama</span></i><span style>’s had a long afternoon. I’ve already ordered servants to prepare dinner. Will you stay and share a meal together?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This servant is quite gratified by the miss’ offer of food. However, you are the apple of the lord’s eye and have a noble identity. I would not dare impose on you. I thank you for your good intentions.” Zhan-</span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>declined with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are my rules teacher now,” Qin Yining shook her head with a smile. “You’re my master as well then. That a disciple shares a table with the master actually counts as the disciple overstepping themselves. Please don’t stand on ceremony.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>These words were simply too apt, making it impossible for the palace servant to refuse again. She also did want to spend more time with Qin Yining, so she accepted this time with thanks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dinner wasn’t quite that sumptuous, but Qin Yining had purposefully sent Zhu-</span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style> to the main kitchen with silver to order some additional dishes. There were four meat and four vegetarian dishes, as well as one soup. Since Zhu-</span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style>’s daughter-in-law worked in the main kitchens, the food tasted more sophisticated than ordinary offerings. Although the two kept to the rule of not speaking when eating, they felt that they’d grown closer after one meal. They enjoyed tea afterwards, and Qin Yining had Ruilan and Qiulu accompany the </span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style> back to the guest quarters after dinner. Qiulu also remained at the </span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style>’s side as a personal maid, with orders not to be lax on care at all. </span></p>
 <p><span style>In actuality, the manor hadn’t paid much attention to a </span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style> here to teach rules and had arranged for the palace servant to take up residence in the west wing of Snowpear Courtyard. Qin Yining had sent Ruilan to Garden of Tranquility that afternoon to speak with Jin-</span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style>, explaining that the </span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style> was here on the empress’ orders. Née Sun immediately placed more importance on their visitor and set up the guest residence after a discussion with the old dowager.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhu-</span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style> had already set up the paper, ink, and brush for the fourth miss to copy “The Classic of Filial Piety” when Ruilan returned from accompanying Zhan-</span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style> to the guest residence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Miss.” The maid took the </span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style>’s position with a smile after making her greeting. “Everything’s been arranged for properly. Jin-</span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style> has put Zhu-</span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style> in Jade Bamboo Veranda, to the east of the bamboo forest. It’s a very elegant residence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Yining didn’t lift her head as her brush flew over paper. “I see.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those in the manor had been too lackadaisical. She herself was fine if the </span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style> lived in the same residence as her, but if the palace servant felt that she’d been insulted, then they would receive hard questions from the empress. </span></p>
 <p><span style>When Ruilan thought of how exquisite Jade Bamboo Veranda was compared to Snowpear Courtyard and took a look at her mistress’ charming profile, she heaved an imperceptible sigh. Qin Yining also wanted to sigh when she looked at the chicken scratches on the paper. She was certain that the old dowager would be utterly disdainful of this copy of the classic, and might even fly into a rage saying that Qin Yining hadn’t treated this matter with the proper gravity. She’d tried to summon the best of her handwriting, but her writing was extremely ugly. She had to give up on this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Penmanship wouldn’t be mastered overnight, but the deadline to hand in her punishment wasn’t far off. She had to think of a way to pass this challenge…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The warm interior of Garden of Loving Piety.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? The </span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>here to teach Qin Yining manners is here by order of the empress herself?” Qin Huining paused from applying lotion to her face and turned from the mirror. “The empress is such an exalted figure, how could she possibly think of arranging a </span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style> for that wild brat? It has to be father!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cai-</span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style> sighed, “That must be the case.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Father’s never cared about me like this before…” Qin Huining felt lost all of a sudden, and her eyes glinted coldly in the next moment. “What kind of person is that </span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style>?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Apparently, she used to serve Dowager Consort Xuanyi and Imperial Noble Consort Luming. She then went to Palace of Accumulated Purity and oversaw the education of the selected ladies during the imperial harem selection.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What a strong background!” Qin Huining pursed her lips and gazed upon her reflection in the mirror, slowly losing herself in her thoughts. She knew that her origins were unknown, and although she could vie with Qin Yining for a bit in terms of status, that was due to her foundations of spending fourteen years within the manor. What if Qin Yining surpassed her one day? Her parents and Old Dowager were already biased towards their real daughter. Although Qin Huining was superior when it came to literature, she had to admit that her looks weren’t as striking as the barbarian. Even though Qin Huining was outwardly dismissive and mouthed the words “take a wife for her virtues, take a concubine for her looks”, and that her future in-laws might not like a temptress for their daughter-in-law, what man didn’t like a good looking woman?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her position as the official firstborn had already been replaced, making her future marriage a difficult thing. If she allowed Qin Yining to have such an outstanding </span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style> teach her rules and help the barbarian never to make a mistake when it came to manners, wouldn’t that give Qin Yining another arrow in her quiver? </span><i><span style>No! No!</span></i><span style> She couldn’t let matters proceed like this!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Huining bolted to her feet and tightened her hands around the hem of her skirt until her fingertips were white. She loosened them after a while as the look in her eyes turned into one of happy confidence. “Wet nurse, go see if grandmother’s had her tea yet. I should go wash grandmother’s feet at this time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cai-</span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style> responded affirmatively.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Huining appeared in the old dowager’s house before long, wearing a placid and docile expression on her face, washing the old dowager’s feet and lighting her tobacco pipe. As the two chattered, the girl mentioned casually, “…Zhan-</span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style> has such an illustrious background, it would be helpful for all the girls in the manor if they could learn together. …Second Uncle and Third Uncle would be thankful to father if they learned that their daughters were benefitting as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The old dowager began musing on this.</span></p>
