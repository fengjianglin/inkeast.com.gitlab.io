<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Yining was in no hurry. Her unadorned hand reached for the teapot to refill Li Yanyan’s cup, then pushed the refreshment to her visitor’s side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Yanyan smiled at her host. “His Majesty has bestowed a manor upon the commandery prince. It’s a bit of a distance from your family’s. We’ve just finished moving, so I wanted to come pay you a visit. We’re all from Great Yan, after all. No matter what unpleasantness we had before, we’re all one family now that we’re here in Great Zhou.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The commandery princess consort’s visage was gentle and friendly, the same amiable air that Qin Yining had seen on Mt. Eternal Spring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reversion was surprising, but the Qin fourth miss smiled and didn’t express anything. “So His Majesty has already gifted you a manor. I’m stuck in the Qin residence all day and have become a frog at the bottom of a well. I don’t know anything about what’s happening outside, so am deeply embarrassed that Your Highness has visited before I’ve tendered my congratulations on your new home.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Yanyan heaved a silent sigh of relief to see how polite Qin Yining was being. It looked like she’d been thinking too much just now. There were no hidden barbs within the Qin fourth miss’ greeting of ‘an honored guest truly brings grace and fortune to our home’.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not at all. Everyone’s in the same difficult straits, having newly arrived in Great Zhou. I understand, even if nothing is explicitly said.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Yining responded only with a gentle smile. It suddenly felt bizarre to be speaking of matters of the heart when the two of them weren’t that close. They were only acquaintances to begin with, and then enemies after both ended up in the Great Yan palace. It was then that the Qin fourth miss had known that the two of them wouldn’t suddenly become fast friends.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that her host wasn’t saying much, Li Yanyan proposed topics of her own. She mostly stuck to the prosperity of the Great Zhou capital or what print fabrics were most in vogue. What she never brought up was the purpose of her visit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Impatience brewed when Qin Yining saw that her guest was beating around the bush. But she'd always had a lot of patience and could keep her cool. Since Li Yanyan wasn’t being forthright, neither would she ask anything either. She merely kept her guest company and piped in with a word or two whenever appropriate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The princess consort talked herself hoarse, fully imparting the undertones of, “I have something to discuss with you.” But the Qin fourth miss refused to rise to the bait.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Yanyan was quite resigned. When back in Great Yan, this move was more than effective against middle-aged noblewomen. Why wasn’t it working on a girl sixteen years of age?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing the day grow old, she couldn’t linger much longer. “I have something to discuss with you,” whispered the princess consort.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finally out of patience?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Arching a mental eyebrow with a hidden smile, Qin Yining waved a hand behind her back to Jiyun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The maid dismissed herself and the others, while Li Yanyan’s maids also retreated to the covered hallway, standing guard at the doors to prevent anyone from drawing close.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Qin fourth miss smiled. “Please speak freely of whatever’s on your mind.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m actually here today for the most important matter in your life.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh?” The Qin fourth miss raised a brow. “I hadn’t realized Your Highness likes to play matchmaker now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Is she mocking me?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Yanyan held in her discomfort with force of will and smiled demurely. “I didn’t have anything else to do either, and it’s not like I’m worrying about an outsider.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She looked at the Qin fourth miss gently. “The commandery prince and I have heard about the suffering you underwent a while ago in the manor of the Faithful Prince of the First Rank. The prince is really quite heartbroken on your behalf. But alas, none of us are in full command of our fates. I know Miss Qin is one with high moral character and won’t have your heart swayed by crass silver and gold. Therefore, I didn’t bring any of that with me today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I won’t talk in circles given our relationship. I’m here today on behalf of you and the prince. The prince only has me and Gu Chang by his side these days. The other concubines have all died, wasted away from illness, or were lost on the way here. The prince genuinely likes you. As long as you give the nod, he will immediately request an imperial decree to welcome you as his concubine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I rather feel that it doesn’t matter if one is a consort or a concubine. The most important thing is that the prince really does like you. I know that younger sister Qin has suffered a lot in the outside world. It’s so wonderful now to have such a good shelter opening his arms in welcome to you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Yining kept her primly seated position as she listened mildly to Li Yanyan’s words. It was impossible for the commandery princess to detect the girl’s preferences, and the former grew more and more uncertain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, she also strongly felt that it was already unparalleled favor for the prince to create a spot for the Qin fourth miss. Surely the girl would understand that she should be content with a peaceful, stable home!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ever since Gu Chang’s purposeful words in front of Yuchi Yan, Li Yanyan could feel that her husband’s affections for Qin Yining had grown a little deeper.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As opposed to having Yuchi Yan raise the issue himself, or let that little bitch claim all the glory, it’d be better for her, the official wife, to think of it first. With Yuchi Yan’s identity, she would be unable to prevent more women from entering through his doors, but it would be easy to be a virtuous wife.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Yining’s long lashes fluttered down and she shook her head after a moment. “Thank you for your sentiments, Your Highness. But you also know the situation at court, right? I’m no longer the noble daughter from before. My father is an official at court and has his hands tied in many things. I’m the same way, being a Qin.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The princess consort looked blankly at the response. She didn’t understand what the fourth miss was getting at, but the notes of rejection rang loud and clear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If anything was proposed, the Qin fourth miss would refuse to join their household!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yet Li Yanyan actually felt relief at this outcome. Gu Chang was already showing her up with those fake, simpering affectations. If Qin Yining came to their manor, then it was only a matter of time before Li Yanyan lost her position of commandery princess consort.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t be in a hurry to turn it down, younger sister Qin.” She sighed. “Though Great Zhou is good, it’s still different from our nation. Every man here bristles with strength and martial arts, but that also means a lack of tenderness and care. Why don’t you think about it some more?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Yining smiled faintly. “You don’t have to try to convince me anymore, Your Highness. My intentions are very clear. I won’t marry into the imperial family. Even if the commandery prince is only former royalty, I still won’t marry him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Yanyan was secretly delighted by this declaration. As long as the girl refused to acquiesce, that meant the princess consort still had hope in the fights to come.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And if the Qin fourth miss was even willing to speak a few good words on her behalf, Li Yanyan was certain that her future would be one of blissful, marital contentment with Yuchi Yan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But the princess consort also knew that it was impossible for Qin Yining to say anything good on her behalf.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright then.” Li Yanyan had delivered her message. Her husband had hinted for her to play matchmaker, and she had done so. Whether or not she had succeeded had nothing to do with her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She rose and nodded. “Do think it over, younger sister. Perhaps next time it’ll be His Highness visiting you.” She covered her mouth as she giggled, like she’d delivered a joke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Yining smiled faintly and called Bingtang and Jiyun over to send Li Yanyan out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the princess consort reached her carriage, she continuously reminded Qin Yining, “Your family has fallen on hard times now. If younger sister is willing to follow the prince, you’d be able to save your family quite a bit of expense.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For a noble daughter who’d never known the value of silver, this kind of excuse perfectly illustrated how pinched for money&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yuchi Yan</span><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;was, and how fixated he was on Qin Yining.</span></p>
