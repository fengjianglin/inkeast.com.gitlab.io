 <p><span style>Chapter 229: An Atypical Selection (I)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grand Supervisor Lu knew quite well that he couldn’t afford offend any of the Qins. Grand Preceptor Qin was the emperor’s most valued official and Miss Qin the emperor’s beloved girl. The palace servant put away his usual temper and bent even lower at the waist. He smiled fawningly. “In response to my lord, we’re here to escort Miss Qin into the palace for the selection.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This early?” Qin Huaiyuan raised a quizzical brow, his voice as gentle as ever but somehow exerting a heavy atmosphere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Eunuch Lu smiled most apologetically. “It’s His Majesty’s wish. Apart from your noble daughter, Miss Li from the Duke of An’s household and Miss Sun from Master Gu’s household will also be entering the palace today.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you mean the imperial strategist Master Gu?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Indeed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was happening here was immediately apparent to Qin Huaiyuan. The Duke of An, Li Mian, was a general. Together with the late Duke of Ding, they’d been hailed as the ‘Double Heroes’ of Great Yan. Apart from the Prince of Ning, the representative general still serving at court could only be the Duke of An.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Imperial strategist Gu Shixiong was deeply trusted by the previous emperor. The Gus themselves were a family with foundations of a hundred years old. Many of its descendants served at court as well. Now that the Caos had been wiped from the map and the cards of officials reshuffled, the Gus had one of the largest networks at court.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Though Qin Huaiyuan was at another peak of his career, his family’s foundations were shallow and the clan’s descendants few. And even though he was a leader of the officials for civil subjects, he wasn’t their representative.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The emperor must’ve chosen one civil and one martial family to balance each other out. As for Qin Yining, she was already a must-have in his heart, so he didn’t factor her in the balance at all. </span></p>
 <p><span style>That had given rise to a blind spot. The Duke of An was a general, but Qin Huaiyuan and Gu Shixiong were in the civil subjects camp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In times of war, the emperor should be promoting large numbers of generals to raise troop morale, and not take the age-old path of valuing civil over martial.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Huaiyuan shook his head with resignation. He would offer his advice in any other matter, but since this matter had to do with the Qins, any other opinions would result in imperial paranoia.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You know as well, Lu-</span><i><span style>gonggong</span></i><span style>, that we just weathered a tremendous disaster a few days ago. Just look at the houses behind us.” The marquis pointed behind him with a smile and a sigh. “To be honest, my daughter was wounded by the assassins as well. She’s burning with fever even now and I can’t bear to let her leave home.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the eunuch’s perspective, he could indeed see the many burnt and ruined buildings in the complex. It was also no secret that a good number of Qin clan members had died. Besides, off to the side, the fourth miss looked sickly and was only standing upright thanks to her maids supporting her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It really was a bit over-the-top to have her move into the palace right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But when he’d left, the empire had reminded him again and again that just anyone could be sent to welcome the other two girls; the eunuch had to personally go to the Qins and have Qin Yining brought into the palace immediately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A conflicted expression filled the eunuch’s face. “You’re very right, Grand Preceptor. It’s just that I daren’t disobey an imperial decree. But don’t worry, the emperor’s told me in confidence that the selection is just a formality. The other two girls are just a show of imperial favor for two veteran officials. They’ll be given some concubine title. Only the miss of your house is his true love.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu-</span><i><span style>gonggong</span></i><span style> looked up with a fawning smile at this point, but was greeted with two utterly bland expressions from the Qin father and daughter. Their genteel, elegant demeanors stopped his next ingratiating words in their tracks. </span><i><span style>These two have identical reactions when it comes to both favor and humiliation. The old fox has raised a young fox alright!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He was even more careful with what he said. “The emperor won’t mistreat Miss Qin, and I know that Zhan-</span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style> and the young miss are already acquainted with each other. The palace will assign fine people to take care of the miss.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Huaiyuan frowned with unwillingness when he saw the unnatural flush of his daughter’s cheeks and her bloodless lips. He wanted to continue fighting for some more time at home for her, but Qin Yining walked up to tug on her father’s sleeve.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the emperor’s eyes, any further protestation wouldn’t be doting on a daughter, but growing arrogance from a showing of imperial favor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry, father. I’m sure that Lu-</span><i><span style>gonggong</span></i><span style> has arranged for everything properly. There are imperial physicians in the palace who can also look after me as well.” She turned to the eunuch and smiled politely. “Please excuse us, </span><i><span style>gonggong</span></i><span style>. I’m my father’s only child and you also know that it hasn’t been long since I’ve returned home. Now that I’m injured, my father is even more concerned about me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aiyo, of course this servant understands. It’s deeply touching that milord cares so much for his family.” Eunuch Lu nodded repeatedly. </span><i><span style>As expected of someone who the emperor thinks can be empress. Her looks are excellent, her wits sharp, and her style mature.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Huaiyuan could tell that things were set in stone and that no further wiggle room was possible. “Alright then, please wait a moment. My daughter will bid farewell to the family and pack her belongings.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Awkwardness crossed the eunuch’s face again. This actually wasn’t an unreasonable request. The marquis’ sole daughter was leaving the family and naturally had to bid farewell to her female relations. It was also commonplace that she bring some of her necessities.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was just, the emperor had given him repeated reminders when he left that, “It doesn’t matter if the others want to do all that, but everything should be as simple as possible for Miss Qin. Everything can be settled later as long as she enters the palace first!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>It was obvious that the emperor was deathly afraid of any further unexpected changes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The eunuch could only speak on with dogged persistence. “The emperor has spoken. Only Miss Qin needs to enter the palace. After all, everything is ready in the palace and your family can visit anytime, no?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Flames of anger licked at Qin Huaiyuan’s heart. The emperor was being too crassly impatient. Had he forgotten all of his manners after being made emperor? This was an uncouth, lowly display!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Yining was worried that the scene would become awkward if her father erupted. She offered a smile. “The emperor speaks truly. Then I’ll have to be a bother and follow the </span><i><span style>gonggong</span></i><span style> into the palace. I do have two bodyservants…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“His Majesty means that although the maids in the manor are good, they don’t understand the rules of the palace. He will naturally arrange the best of servants for the miss in the palace.” </span><i><span style>You can’t bring any of your servants with you.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Now it was Jiyun and Bingtang’s turn to become panicky with anger. </span><i><span style>And what the hell is this?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The miss couldn’t bid farewell to her grandmother and mother, she wasn’t allowed any luggage, and couldn’t even bring her trusted maids! Could she not even change her clothing?! She was going into the palace all alone like this! </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Just what do they think our miss is?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A slow fury was also burning in Qin Yining and her smile faded. “Are these the emperor’s orders? My maids do lack knowledge of palace rules, so I suppose I could do without them, but I’m injured. You should at least let me bring my medicine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sweat beaded Lu-</span><i><span style>gonggong’s </span></i><span style>forehead. This was the future empress! Sir Qin was the future imperial father-in-law! </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Forget it, forget it. The details don’t matter as long as I can bring her back.</span></i><span style> He was just a eunuch; he wanted to keep his head! “Of course, but please keep an eye on the time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Warmth returned to Qin Yining’s expression and she turned to Jiyun and Bingtang. “Go fetch my medicines and daily necessities. Ah yes, pack my books as well. Bring Riceball with you too. I’m afraid it’ll be boring in the palace.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. Then your clothes, miss?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We probably don’t have time for that. You can send them into the palace later.” The girl turned to Lu-</span><i><span style>gonggong</span></i><span style> with a smile. “Please allow the deliveries to go on through then.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The eunuch sweated profusely. “Yes, yes of course!”</span></p>
