 <p><span style>Bingtang was also berating herself for being so rash that she’d made Qin Yining sad. “Don’t worry, miss. This wound will be fine if taken care of properly. I spoke so harshly just now because I wanted His Highness to take it more seriously.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know.” Qin Yining wiped her eyes with her sleeves and forced a smile on her face. “Hurry and treat him. I’ll have Jiyun prepare some late night snacks.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She made to leave, but —</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t go, I’m not hungry.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>It’d been such a risk to enter the capital so he could see her. How could he bear to have her leave his sight?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nonsense. Since you slipped into the city and had to avoid the spies around the manor, you definitely haven’t had the chance to have a good meal. Bingtang says you’re feverish. You have to take care of your body.” An inexplicable blush crossed Qin Yining’s face at this point. “I’ll be right back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She left the outer area of the bed through the curtains.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pang Xiao grinned foolishly for a while as he mind turned over a teary yet embarrassed Qin Yining. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t say this in front of your miss in the future, she’ll be sad.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bingtang snorted. “My miss is very smart. Do you think she doesn’t understand anything just because she doesn’t talk much? She’s just being quiet. If you really want to be good to my mistress, then take care of yourself. Since you’ve captured the miss’ heart even despite being from another nation, don’t ever make her sad again. She’s not the healthiest either.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pang Xiao knew all this, of course, but sometimes things were beyond his control given what he’d been born into.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How is her injury?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She’s lost too much blood and harmed her foundations. She needs to rest and recover for a long while. Being who she is, my miss has a never-ending stream of troubles and worries. What constantly down person can live a long life?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pang Xiao frowned, perturbed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t even have to go too far back. When we ran short on food in the capital last month, the people somehow learned that the previous emperor stole all of the nation’s silver. All of them rushed to Xuan Su Temple to ask her how the troubles will be resolved. It’s frightening to simply think of the scene!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The miss isn’t an official at court, her titles are all for show. Because he couldn’t take her as a wife, the emperor ordered her to be a nun in a fit of anger. This gave the people a good reason to make life difficult for the miss.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If she’d said a single word wrongly that day, she would’ve faced the spit and violence of ten thousand people. She came up with an idea for the emperor in the end, but the empress decided to make life difficult for her instead. And the thing is, it’s not like this was an exception. The miss would feel soul weary even if she’s a female Zhuge Liang.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bingtang rolled an eye at Pang Xiao at this point and made sure his wounds were carefully wrapped up tight. “Our miss wasn’t born into an easy life, and you aren’t making things any better.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since the maid was on her mistress’ side, she laid it on a bit thick, but her words weren’t too far from the truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pang Xiao naturally knew how difficult things were for his beloved. He listened to everything with a tight frown furrowing his brow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bingtang put her medicine kit back in order and handed over a prescription. She dropped, “I will go brew the medicine now,” and dismissed herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After this heavy blow to the heart, she hoped that Pang Xiao would think more on Qin Yining’s behalf whenever he did anything in the future.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Qin fourth miss returned at this point with Jiyun, bearing a freshly stewed brown sugar congee, steamed dumplings, and a few side dishes. Jiyun hauled some small tables next to the bed to hold all the dishes and left with a curtsey. After pulling the two layers of veil and curtains together, she stood guard outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Yining handed over a pair of chopsticks and sat next to Pang Xiao with a velvet hand. She flung one of her pale-green, padded jackets around his shoulders and waved the fan gently, watching him wolf down the food.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I already asked Bingtang, make sure you rest well after going back. Don’t fight unless you have to. It’s the troubles of a lifetime if there’s any lasting effects on your health. Who will you cry to in your old age, hmm?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Naturally you, of course.” The prince gulped down steamed dumplings one after another, his movements quick and elegant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Yining shook her head with an involuntary smile. “I can listen to your complaints, but I can’t suffer for you, so you must take care of yourself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you promising the rest of your life to me?” Pang Xiao stopped eating and looked at her with burning eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The girl thought back on their conversation and ran through things before she realized what she’d said. Blushing, she smacked him with the velvet fan. “Hurry up and eat, then take your medicine. Thankfully I haven’t recovered yet and need to take medicines all day, so no one will think it’s weird if we’re brewing medicines now. Rest here after you take your medicine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pang Xiao smiled and protested insincerely, “I can leave after seeing you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s so dangerous outside </span><i><span style>and</span></i><span style> you’re injured. How could I possibly let you leave?” Qin Yining rolled her eyes at him. “Taking a mile after I give an inch, hmm? You just wanted to hear me say that! It’s not like you would’ve turned down staying the night.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course not.” Pang Xiao grinned. “I just wanted to hear you talk more.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How cunning.” Qin Yining dimpled as well. Once the prince was full, she fetched a pot of strong tea to rinse his mouth and a wet handkerchief to wipe his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pang Xiao remained seated on the bed, watching her busy ministrations as if she was his wife. Longing and contentment flooded his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Take a break, my darling. Let’s chat.” Pang Xiao took her hand and had her sit in his lap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Yining squirmed uncomfortably, but his arms had firmly secured her waist and she couldn’t struggle free. She gave up in the end and complained, “What’s this for? The bed is so big, there’s plenty of space for me. Let go of me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t move.” Pang Xiao kept himself tightly tensed, tamping down his agitated emotions despite the beauty in his arms. “I just missed you. Even if I stay the night, I need to find an opportunity to leave the city tomorrow. We spend more time apart than together, so don’t hide from me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reluctance sprang forth when she heard that he needed to leave on the morrow. Qin Yining stopped protesting and laid her head quietly on his shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pang Xiao encircled her with one arm and rested his head on her inky locks. He raised the other to softly carrels her cheek.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry, I’ll end this war as soon as possible. The faster it’s over, the less suffering we both endure, and the faster the people can lead lives of peace.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since she lived in the capital, Qin Yining didn’t want for food or clothing. She didn’t know what the outside world had turned into, and Pang Xiao couldn’t bear to tell her. But when war erupted, accidents and mistakes involving civilians always happened, regardless of how strictly trained the army was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The girl knew that she couldn’t ask him about the military. They were on opposite sides, after all. If he said too much and something happened in relation to it, it would give rise to unnecessary misunderstanding and conflict between the two of them. “Just leave everything up to heaven. Do whatever you want to do as long as you’re safe.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moved, Pang Xiao kissed the top of her head. “I know.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Miss, the medicine is ready.” Jiyun’s voice traveled in from outside the bed, prompting a blush to Qin Yining’s face. She hastily threw off his arm and rose to take the medicine.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But at this time, née Sun sounded from the outer room. “Bingtang brewed medicine? How is daughter Yi doing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Yining started with fright and almost dropped the bowl. She turned and hissed, “Hide!”</span></p>
