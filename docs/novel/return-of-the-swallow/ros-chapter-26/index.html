 <p><span style>Chapter 26: Family Culture </span></p>
 <p><span style>The old dowager smiled when the girls returned to the outer room. “It’s growing late. You all should be heading to Garden of Tranquility for lessons in manners, no?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, grandmother.” The girls nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Dowager, we’ll have lessons as usual today,” said née Sun. “I’ll take daughter Yi for a visit back home tomorrow morning. Zhan-</span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style> can teach the other girls as usual then.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The old dowager nodded with a smile, seemingly not detecting anything untoward in née Sun’s words. Qin Huining, staring at them, finally couldn’t help but tug on née Sun’s sleeve and ask apprehensively, “Mother, are you not bringing me? I also miss my maternal grandparents.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Née Sun had been hesitant. When Sun Yu had brought word just now, he’d said that the duchess had wanted to see the newly found pearl, but he hadn’t said that they wanted to see the foster daughter. But her thoughts took a spin in another direction. </span><i><span style>They want to see their granddaughter, but didn’t say which one. I’ll just pretend I got confused and bring Qin Huining as well.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course you’re coming.” Née Sun brushed at Qin Huining’s hair tenderly. “We’ll go together tomorrow morning.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Huining smiled cutely as she clung to née Sun’s arm. The sixth miss spoke with admiration off to the side, “Senior aunt, please bring us with you if you have the chance to in the future. I’ve heard that the Duke of Ding’s garden is even larger than ours, and that it’s quite beautiful!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The second madame’s expression underwent subtle changes at this, and she glared at the sixth miss. But the girl wasn’t as docile as usual and was looking at née Sun with blushing cheeks and sparkling eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Née Sun felt quite heady with the rush of compliments and nodded. “I’ll take you all with me if there’s a chance to in the future.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you, senior aunt!” The sixth miss smiled sweetly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’re all one family so it’s good to visit more often. Granddaughter Yi has just returned this time, she’ll have much to say to her grandparents. You girls can go next time. You’ll all have an opportunity.” The old dowager didn’t think much of this. </span><i><span style>Kids will be kids. They so love to play. </span></i><span style>The girls all responded affirmatively.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Yining had a very busy day, but perhaps because she was to visit her maternal grandparents on the morrow, she was a bit distracted during her studies. She couldn’t even remember the various rules and manners that Zhan-</span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style> taught her, even after the </span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style> repeated herself. The palace servant gave up for the day after a few tries. Qin Yining also discovered that Qin Huining’s looks at her had grown even more vengeful. It was as if there was a blood feud between the two.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She still went to the study in the outer residence in the afternoon, listening to the teacher behind a screen. Night had already fallen by the time she returned to Snowpear Courtyard. Her emotions were a bit all over the place because she was to meet the Duchess of Ding tomorrow and had no idea how her maternal grandmother was. She had Ruilan prepare her outfit and then asked Zhan-</span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style> to look it over, only resting when she was certain that everything was in order. But as she lay in bed, she carefully recalled the circumstances of Bao-</span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style>’s visit. They all said that birds of a feather flock together. Bao-</span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style> was a trusted confidante by the duchess’ side and would naturally have some insight into the duchess’ demeanor. Her style and way of speaking would inevitably be similar to her mistress. Qin Yining finally went to sleep peacefully when she thoroughly went over all the sticky situations that could develop and brainstormed strategies in response.</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>The night passed calmly. After greeting the old dowager in the morning, Qin Yining went back to Snowpear Courtyard to wash up and change clothes. She had chosen a pastel pink, plain silk padded jacket with large sleeves today. It was paired with a downy-yellow, simple pleated skirt <a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>. The outfit was topped off by a crimson cape lined with white rabbit fur on the collar. This heightened Qin Yining’s bashfulness as a young girl, but didn’t downplay her looks, whereas the fabric and work of the clothes emphasized her status as a noble daughter. </span></span></p>
 <p><span style>As for jewelry, she selected two jade cloves and a crab-apple hairpin from the jewelry set that third madame had gifted Qin Yining to adorn her hair. The girl’s hair was jet-black. When the crap-apple hairpin was set into her partially upswept hairstyle, it heightened the inky luster of the locks and made the hairpin appear exquisite and precious. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Mama</span></i><span style>, I think one at my age doesn’t need powder, right?” Qin Yining looked at the various bottles on her vanity mirror and started coughing at the various fragrances that were assaulting her nose.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The palace servant tucked away some errant strands of hair with a smile. “The miss is perfect this way. You were born with good skin, and young girls don’t need powder or rouge. But it’s cold outside, so you should use the ointment lightly scented with jasmine on your face. It wouldn’t do for the wind to chap your cheeks.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As you say, </span><i><span style>mama.</span></i><span style>” Qin Yining nodded with a smile. She was bringing only Ruilan with her to the Duke of Ding’s manor. She could’ve brought a </span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style> as well, but upon further observation, Qin Yining discovered that Zhu-</span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style> was a quiet one who did everything she was told. The old servant wasn’t suited for important tasks at all, whereas Zhan-</span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style> wasn’t one of hers, so there was nothing to be done either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ruilan had changed into a pale-green outer jacket and skirt combination for the trip today. She’d slipped a bright-red long vest with a furred collar on over the outfit. The coordination of red and green looked quite fetching due to her youth, and made her appear very dependable as well. “Miss, the carriage has been prepared. Senior Madame says the carriage will be parked outside the second door and leave via the western side door. We should head for the carriage now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Yining stepped into the sedan holding an exquisite hand warmer. Ruilan stood next to the sedan, following when it headed out to the second door. They swapped out for a small carriage wallpapered with wax paper, reaching the western side door after a short travel. There was already a long convoy waiting in front of the door. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The prime minister’s wife was openly heading home in full glory, and bringing her daughter as well. It wasn’t a quick scurry home in a singular carriage like last time. Two luxurious carriages adorned with tassels had been arranged for the mistresses. A small, plain one followed behind for the </span><i><span style>mamas</span></i><span style> honored enough to come along for the trip. The convoy was rounded out with two carriages loaded with gifts. There were at least a dozen servants and guards in the retinue as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Yining climbed into the first carriage via a red lacquer footstool. She lifted the carriage curtains to see née Sun and Qin Huining sitting closely to each other in the main seat. Jin-</span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style> was sitting in the side seat and quickly greeted the fourth miss. Qin Yining returned the greeting and curtseyed to née Sun. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Née Sun was wearing a pale purple garment today, her knitted silk cloak quite an opulent fashion statement. Her exquisite makeup had erased all traces of age from her face, leaving only a demure and beautiful madame. Qin Huining’s outfit on the other hand, was stunningly outside of Qin Yining’s expectations. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Yining sat down across from Jin-</span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style> and began openly looking at Qin Huining. The foster daughter had thrown on a turquoise, knitted silk cloak and an aqua brocade dress. Her clothing was in muted shades, but she’d put hard work into her makeup. Her slender eyebrows arched slightly upwards, and powder was perfectly applied. The deep red of her lips hearkened to the red jade beads of her earrings, enhancing the girl’s overall looks greatly. The ensemble did indeed look good, going beyond her usual demureness and giving a few hints of a sharply domineering beauty. </span></p>
 <p><span style>She was perhaps made uncomfortable by Qin Yining’s assessment and frowned slightly. “What are you looking at, younger sister Little Creek?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Miss Huining looks so pretty in this that I lost myself in appreciation.” Qin Yining smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s nothing compared to your natural beauty.” The response held barely concealed jealousy. Qin Huining had dressed to win against Qin Yining, because she’d thought that the newcomer would dress to the best of her ability for her first visit to the Duke of Ding. Who would’ve thought that Qin Yining wouldn’t use any powder and wear barely any jewelry?! Most irritating of all was that the charm and allure in Qin Yining’s looks was all natural and apparent even without cosmetics. Qin Huining had been a bit proud of her get up today, but she could feel her pride shatter all over the floor with Qin Yining sitting in front of her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The atmosphere grew a bit awkward. Jin-</span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style> coughed lightly and took a look at née Sun who was resting with her eyes half closed. The old servant smiled. “Fourth Miss, it’s your first visit to the Duke of Ding Manor. How about I introduce the household there to you?” Her attitude was especially respectful. There wasn’t a trace of her initial impatience to be found.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Yining knew that these people were materialistic and changed with the wind. She wasn’t angry at this and smiled gratefully instead. “Many thanks to Jin-</span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style>, I was about to ask you the same.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jin-</span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style> began her explanations in a low voice. Although the Duke of Ding was a venerated and wealthy official, they were a family of scholars. Their house rules were exceedingly stern. Although they were accustomed to wielding power, none of their children of the main or side family branches, especially the three generations directly beneath the duke and duchess’ care, had ever had bullying scandals. What was most admirable and rare to Qin Yining was that all of the girls in this household were very close to each other. If the duchess caught anyone scheming or framing others, heavy punishment would be in store.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The duchess says that a family united is a family that can withstand external pressure and attack. Although a flower looks pretty from the outside, it won’t live long if the core is rotten.” Jin-</span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>basked in shared glory, whereas Qin Yining was in deep agreement. Compared to this, the prime minister manor seemed rather… base…</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were only two branches to the the duke’s family clan. Née Sun was the official firstborn daughter, but ranked number three in her family tree. Her two older brothers doted on her quite heavily. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Miss, your senior uncle and second uncle are all generals fighting against Great Zhou and aren’t in the manor at the moment. However, your senior aunt and second aunt are both present. You have six female cousins and five male cousins—the eldest of which came yesterday with the invitation.” Jin-</span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style> started describing the members of the household after going over the family culture. Qin Yining committed everything to memory and was fully familiar with the Duke of Ding Manor’s household structure and atmosphere by the time they arrived.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The lady’s come back!” A delighted voice sounded from outside the carriage. A runner was sent into the manor. “Hurry and tell Elder Madame that the eldest lady and miss has returned!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The servants had already placed a red lacquer footstool on the ground when they lifted the carriage curtain. Jin-</span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style> jumped off to help née Sun alight, Cai-</span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>and Bitong supported Qin Huining, while Ruilan supported Qin Yining. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The group had just crossed the inner door inside the main doors whereupon they were greeted by the hubbub of two older women leading a group of young girls.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I told everyone to come out later, but your second sister-in-law wanted to come out earlier because she said you’d be here soon. Now we’re all cold.” One of the older women held née Sun’s hand and spoke intimately, “Aw, your hand is so warm!”</span></p>
