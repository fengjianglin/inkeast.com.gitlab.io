 <p><b>Chapter 143 - Messing Up (3)</b></p>
 <p><span style>In the courtyard, it wasn’t as noisy as inside, and the night was quiet and tranquil. Lan Jinyao walked to a big tree in the courtyard and sat down at the bench underneath it. Jiang Cheng followed her closely and sat down right next to her. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Now that there were no outsiders, Lan Jinyao skipped the superfluous words and bluntly asked, “Jiang Cheng, what do you honestly want to achieve by doing this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Cheng laughed and replied, “What I want to achieve? Don’t you know that already?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t like guessing games!” Lan Jinyao emphasised in a heavy tone, sounding slightly angry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Indeed, no one wanted to be like a bird seized in the palm of someone’s hand. That feeling was just horrible. It felt as if one’s life and death was in the hands of others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Cheng slightly bent over and closed the distance between them. He stared at her, smiled, and said, “Could it be that you still don’t get it? I think my actions are quite obvious. Besides, I don’t like you questioning me in such an impatient manner; I helped you the other day.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With the mention of the matter from a few days ago, Lan Jinyao snorted and didn’t refute him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>When Jiang Cheng saw her like this, he laughed again, looking extremely happy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He then added, “Were you worried that I’d tell someone your secret? So, you hastily dragged me out here? In fact, you don’t have to worry since I won’t tell anyone, I just want to keep this secret with me. But...you rashly taking me here, aren’t you afraid that Fu Bainian will get jealous? Is it that you overly trust Fu Bainian or the other way around?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao followed his gaze and saw Fu Bainian standing in front of the door. It was unknown how long he’d stood there for, but he was staring in their direction with a dark look in his eyes. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Look, he doesn’t seem very happy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Cheng was very close to Lan Jinyao, and from a distance, their postures seemed to be very intimate. When this crossed her mind, Lan Jinyao quickly stood up and coldly uttered, “I don’t care what you’re scheming, but I do know that you won’t succeed! Jiang Cheng, you’re a very outstanding person, so I really don’t want to end up hating you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After saying that, Lan Jinyao lifted her dress and trotted towards Fu Bainian. When she arrived in front of Fu Bainian, she lost her footing and leaned forward, nearly falling to the ground. Meanwhile, Fu Bainian, who remained indifferent at first, saw this and without a second thought, immediately extended his hand and caught Lan Jinyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Following this, Lan Jinyao lay in Fu Bainian’s arms in a panicked state for five seconds before quickly snapping out of it and tightly embracing Fu Bainian, revealing a bright smile on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t be offended; I just wanted to make things clear to him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fu Bainian helped her stand up, and then indifferently said, “I don’t mind.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, he turned around and walked towards the living room. Seeing him leave, Lan Jinyao hastily followed him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“What a lie that you don’t mind!” she muttered in a low voice. “It was written all over your face, yet you said you don’t mind. You’re clearly saying one thing, and meaning another.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fu Bainian pretended he didn’t hear anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the couple stood together, they undoubtedly looked like a very eye-catching painting. No matter where Fu Bainian went, Lan Jinyao followed suit. Sometimes she’d coquettishly joke around with him. Even though she didn’t get any response from him, she seemed to enjoy and never tire of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, half an hour later, Fu Bainian finally reacted and said, “Let’s go home in a bit!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao hesitated as she said, “But, Dad told us to stay for the night; even Chen Meile asked earlier. So, how about we stay here for a night?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In fact, she felt as if they hadn’t slept together on the same bed for more than a century already. Although Fu Bainian secretly came back every night to see her, he’d soon leave again every time. Though she didn’t understand the reason for doing so, she felt that Fu Bainian must be keeping something from her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fu Bainian, without hesitation, replied, “No, we can’t!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why not?” muttered Lan Jinyao in response.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Because you’ll expose yourself. Besides, Chen Meile was just being polite in front of Father-in-law. Did you really think that she’d want you to stay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon hearing this, Lan Jinyao felt that she was seemingly looked down upon by Fu Bainian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then, let’s go back in a moment!” Lan Jinyao quietly uttered in a voice filled with disappointment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Chen Meile had learnt that she wasn’t the real Chen Meimei, her attitude towards her changed. Actually, it was effortless for one to perceive whether Chen Meile’s words from earlier were polite or not.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long after, the two of them quietly slipped away and walked side by side towards the courtyard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While they were walking, Lan Jinyao asked, “We didn’t say anything to Dad before we left; that’s not very nice, right? How about we go back and notify him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You keep saying ‘Dad’ again and again, looks like that word is already a part of you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Alright, let’s just go home then!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After getting in the car, Lan Jinyao asked, “Jiang Cheng kept pestering me earlier. Do you want to know what he said to me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn’t you call him to go out?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...That’s not important, the main point is, do you want to know?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fu Bainian remained silent for a long time before he answered, “I don’t want to know!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao: “...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Following that, she didn’t speak anymore. She fiddled around with her fingers, feeling a little disgruntled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, she looked like an angry concubine, and the corner of Fu Bainian’s mouth slightly arched up in an untraceable smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No one noticed that a tall figure was standing at courtyard’s gate, staring at them all this while. Under the moonlight, this man’s gaze looked somewhat gloomy and sinister.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they got home, Lan Jinyao directly plopped on the sofa. Although she hadn’t stood for a very long time today, she still felt extremely tired.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fu Bainian glanced at her and then brought out her pyjamas for her. “Go wash up and then go to bed; don’t sleep on the sofa, it’s not very comfy.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao reached for the pyjamas, and then lazily answered, “Okay!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Afterwards, she just lay there, not moving for a long time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao was thinking: </span><i><span style>Should she tell Fu Bainian about her pregnancy? After all, Fu Bainian had been acting weird recently, so she didn't know what he’d do. If she rashly told him, she was afraid that something terrible might happen.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>After hesitating for a while, Lan Jinyao decided to tell Fu Bainian anyway. She then went into the bathroom with her pyjamas and noticed that the bathtub was already filled. She tested the water temperature, and it was just right.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After taking a relaxing bath, Lan Jinyao walked out of the bathroom and saw that Fu Bainian had already changed into a suit. When he saw her coming out, he casually said, “Shen Yu just called, so I’m going out and might not come back tonight. You can sleep first!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh!” Lan Jinyao blankly replied, staring at Fu Bainian’s disappearing figure. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After a long time, she suddenly remembered that she hadn’t said anything yet.</span></p>
