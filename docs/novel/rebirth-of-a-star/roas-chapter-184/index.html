<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>The press conference was held in the gymnasium, which could accommodate at least five thousand people. Unexpectedly, Jiang Cheng had managed to fill up such an ample space. When Lan Jinyao scanned the audience, she suppressed the inkling of joy that was bubbling up in her heart and stared at the reporter off the stage in a calm and composed manner.</p> 
 <p>The moment she stepped on the stage, countless flashes were sighted.</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao quietly clenched her hands into fists. At this moment, while facing all those cameras off the stage, she felt as if she was facing Fu Bainian instead. She directly stared at those lenses without blinking once.</p> 
 <p>“Thank you all so much for coming today!”</p> 
 <p><em>Jiang Cheng had actually arranged this press conference with great fanfare. Could it be that he wasn’t afraid of alerting the Jiang family? Would the Jiang family allow a divorced woman, who was also an actress, to stay by his side?</em></p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao unhurriedly continued, “Recently, some false rumours and news reports have been circulating on the internet, and these have greatly affected my personal life, so I am here today to clarify the situation in front of all of you. Fu Bainian and I divorced long ago. As for why we divorced, I don’t want to talk about it. What I want to say now is that I don’t regret the fact that I once loved this man.”</p> 
 <p>Before she’d finished her words, a reporter immediately interrupted and asked, “You stressed the words ‘you once loved him’, so what about now?”</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao slightly smiled and responded, “Whether I still love him or not is not my call. This entirely depends on Fu Bainian’s understanding.” <em>If Fu Bainian saw the news, he’d certainly understand. Of course, that was only if Fu Bainian still had faith in her.</em></p> 
 <p>“As for the rumours going around regarding my ambiguous relationship with President Jiang, I hereby officially announce that we’re currently dating.”</p> 
 <p>At this moment, the camera flashes suddenly became more intense. Lan Jinyao’s gaze then shifted to Jiang Cheng’s direction. He was smiling at her as their gazes met.</p> 
 <p>“Actually, there is something else I’d like to announce as well. My new movie ‘Twilight’ will be released soon, and I hope for everyone to pay close attention to it when the time comes.”</p> 
 <p>As for this movie, both she and Chen Zetao had high expectations for it.</p> 
 <p>Once the press conference was over, Lan Jinyao followed behind Jiang Cheng and left through a private passageway. To her surprise, she actually ran into Chen Zetao as soon as she left the gymnasium.</p> 
 <p>Chen Zetao was wearing a black suit and a pair of black sunglasses. He looked like someone from the underworld. When he strode over, Lan Jinyao could seemingly sense the anger contained in his eyes. However, since Chen Zetao was wearing a pair of sunglasses, Lan Jinyao wasn’t sure whether he was angry or not.</p> 
 <p>“President Jiang, can I talk to Meimei alone for a moment?”</p> 
 <p>As Chen Zetao had bluntly asked this question, Jiang Cheng certainly wouldn’t agree to this request. So, before Jiang Cheng could answer, Lan Jinyao quickly said, “Okay, let’s have a quick talk then. Jiang Cheng, you can go back first.”</p> 
 <p>It seemed that Jiang Cheng was in a particularly good mood now that she’d openly admitted to their relationship in front of the media. This was a request that he wouldn’t usually accept, but he actually didn’t say anything this time.</p> 
 <p>“Then, be careful on your own. When you’re ready to go home, just give me a call.”</p> 
 <p>Jiang Cheng extended his hand to her forehead and tucked her hair behind her ear. Lan Jinyao subconsciously wanted to avoid his touch, but when she saw Chen Zetao standing there, she held herself back.</p> 
 <p>Jiang Cheng then left in a happy mood. Lan Jinyao suddenly felt that Jiang Cheng was a person who’d be easily satisfied as long as others followed his demands. He’d be very happy as long as one did things according to his wishes, and he wouldn’t care even if someone said horrible things to him when that happened. If only the one he liked was an ordinary girl, he might’ve been very happy. At least, he’d be much happier than he was now.</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao stopped in front of a teahouse and asked Chen Zetao, “Do you like tea?”</p> 
 <p>A relaxed person like Chen Zetao must certainly like this kind of ancient-looking teahouse.</p> 
 <p>Sure enough, Chen Zetao nodded and went in with her. As soon as they stepped inside, the intense fragrance of tea assaulted their senses. Lan Jinyao took a sniff and felt refreshed.</p> 
 <p>When she opened her eyes, she saw Chen Zetao frowning at her with an incomprehensible look in his eyes.</p> 
 <p>“What’s the matter?”</p> 
 <p>Chen Zetao’s gaze gave her a peculiar feeling.</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao found a spot and sat down, but Chen Zetao’s gaze remained the same as he stared at her.</p> 
 <p>She extended her finger and waved it in front of him. “What’s wrong with you? Don’t tell me that you’re still worried about our movie’s box office sales? Don’t worry, the results won’t be that bad.”</p> 
 <p>“Meimei!” Chen Zetao abruptly looked at her with a solemn expression and called her name with a somber tone.</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao was stunned for a moment before she smiled and said, “What’s wrong with you?” <em>Could it be that he was worried about her relationship with Jiang Cheng? If so, then Chen Zetao was worrying too much!</em></p> 
 <p>“Meimei, you didn’t like to drink tea in the past. You used to say that drinking tea consumes the fat that you’ve accumulated, so you never drank tea nor took diet pills. But, now you’ve really changed a lot, and I almost couldn’t recognise you anymore.”</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao listened to Chen Zetao and almost burst into laughter. <em>It turned out that Chen Meimei was so fat for a reason. She was right; tea would consume the fat accumulated in the body. It seemed that Chen Meimei had really wanted to stay a fatty for the rest of her life. She’d lost all that fat now. If Chen Meimei was still alive, wouldn’t she beat her to death for losing it all?</em></p> 
 <p>“Fu Bainian likes it better when I’m skinnier. I used to be so fat that he never took a second glance at me. Now that I’m skinnier, he certainly can’t live without me anymore, right? So, it was better to stay skinny. As for me liking tea now, it was all thanks to his influence.”</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao didn’t even notice her eyes glowing and her tone accelerating at the mention of Fu Bainian. Even the smile tugging at her lips was mesmerising.</p> 
 <p>After taking a sip of tea, Chen Zetao nodded and said, “It turned out to be Fu Bainian’s influence; no wonder you’ve changed so much.”</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao hurriedly nodded, and in order to not let the cat out of the bag, she wanted to change the topic as soon as possible.</p> 
 <p>However, before she’d managed to do so, Chen Zetao had already changed the topic. It was just that the new topic was worse.</p> 
 <p>“In that case, if you like Fu Bainian so much, then why would you fall in love with someone else? The Chen Meimei I know has always been an affectionate and righteous person. The truth is, you still love Fu Bainian, right?”</p> 
 <p>At this point, Lan Jinyao was rendered speechless. In fact, she understood what Chen Zetao was trying to say. Chen Zetao actually wanted to ask her, ‘Since Jiang Cheng had gotten a chance, then why hadn’t he gotten one?’</p> 
 <p>This question was actually very easy to answer; it was because she wasn’t Chen Meimei. Due to this, it was impossible for her to give Chen Zetao, who only had eyes for Chen Meimei, a chance because it would be unfair to him. However, she really couldn’t say this to his face.</p> 
 <p>“I already answered this question at the press conference earlier.”</p> 
 <p><em>She had to find an excuse and quickly leave. Even though Jiang Cheng had set his mind at rest and had allowed her to chat with Chen Zetao, he must’ve sent someone to follow her secretly.</em></p> 
 <p>She swept a glance around her surroundings and noticed that several people were acting suspiciously.</p>
