<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>That person grasped Lan Jinyao’s hand and held it in his. His touch felt different from Jiang Cheng’s; it gave her a sense of ease and security.</p> 
 <p>The heat from his warm fingertips flowed all the way to her heart. At this instant, Lan Jinyao felt that this was the most reassuring moment she’d ever encountered. The person standing in front of her was actually Fu Bainian, not Jiang Cheng.</p> 
 <p>After confirming that it was Fu Bainian in the darkness, Lan Jinyao immediately sat up from the bed and pounced on him, hugging him tightly. Emotions welled up in her heart, and her tears started to silently fall down her face.</p> 
 <p>Fu Bainian froze in place when Lan Jinyao’s tears stained his shoulder. He then extended his hand and gently touched her cheek. The moisture he felt at his fingertips made him unable to control his emotions, and he trembled all over.</p> 
 <p>“Jinyao, please don’t cry!” Fu Bainian brokenly whispered.</p> 
 <p>However, Lan Jinyao shook her head and cried even harder instead. She buried her face in Fu Bainian’s chest, and her shoulders shook uncontrollably as she tried to stifle her sobs.</p> 
 <p><em>Fu Bainian, he…he’d understood her hint and had come to find her.</em></p> 
 <p>“Fu Bainian, do you know that Jiang Cheng wants you dead? How dare you come here alone? Aren’t you afraid that he’s quietly waiting for you to make an appearance here?”</p> 
 <p>She recalled how shrewd Jiang Cheng was and couldn’t help but tremble in fear. <em>If that man knew that Fu Bainian had openly broken into his manor tonight, then the consequences would be dire.</em></p> 
 <p>But, before she could continue, Fu Bainian suddenly sealed her lips with a kiss. He only let go of her after a long time, when they were both out of breath. At this moment, Lan Jinyao’s cheeks were flushed as she panted for air.</p> 
 <p>Fu Bainian chuckled and said, “Your skills are still so sloppy! Wait until we’re home and we can practice some more!”</p> 
 <p>“Fu Bainian, it’s dangerous, okay?!” Lan Jinyao flew into a rage due to her shame.</p> 
 <p>Fu Bainian didn’t seem to care at all and briskly laughed. “It’s okay; it’s just that I’ve missed you dearly. Jinyao, hang in there and just endure it a bit longer. I’ve already dealt with the assassins that Jiang Cheng hired. Wait a few more days, until I’ve dealt with Jiang Cheng, and then I’ll come to get you.”</p> 
 <p>Currently, Fu Bainian’s voice sounded so cold and ruthless that it could make one shiver with fear. </p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao tightened her grasp on his hand, and threateningly said, “Fu Bainian, I don’t care how you plan to deal with Jiang Cheng, but you must remember to protect yourself; you’re not allowed to get hurt.”</p> 
 <p>Fu Bainian conceded and whispered, “I promise you that I’ll take care of myself, but you must also promise me that you won’t give Jiang Cheng a chance to hurt you. I want you to stay well while waiting for my return.”</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry, I’ll protect myself well!” the rims of Lan Jinyao’s eyes reddened as she responded.</p> 
 <p><em>That man had done too many horrible things to her. One day, she’d let him pay the price for all that he’d done! However, before that, she’d live well. Even if she had to act, she’d live on.</em></p> 
 <p>“Jinyao, I need to leave now. Remember not to piss off that man…everyone in the Jiang family is crazy.”</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao nodded and watched Fu Bainian leave through the window. He landed in the courtyard, and then swiftly advanced; his figure disappearing into the darkness of the night. She remained on the bed and embraced herself as a cool breeze blew over from the window. </p> 
 <p>She felt cold, but she stubbornly refused to close the window. This way, she could seemingly watch over Fu Bainian a little bit longer, even though his departing figure had long disappeared.</p> 
 <p>Then, the bedroom door suddenly flew open, and Jiang Cheng strode in. At this instant, Lan Jinyao’s heart leapt to her throat.</p> 
 <p>She frowned, and asked in a voice filled with displeasure, “What are you doing here so late?”</p> 
 <p>Jiang Cheng had a complicated look on his face as he stared in her direction. His piercing gaze was fixated on the window behind her, so Lan Jinyao almost thought that he’d found out about Fu Bainian’s visit.</p> 
 <p>After a while, Jiang Cheng finally withdrew his gaze and explained, “I just came to check on you because you’ve not been sleeping well lately. Aren’t you cold with the window open like this?”</p> 
 <p>“It’s not winter, so how could it be cold?” she coldly retorted. But, as soon as her words left her mouth, she immediately regretted it. <em>Fu Bainian was right; she shouldn’t confront Jiang Cheng head-on because she was currently in an extremely disadvantageous position.</em></p> 
 <p>“It’s already so late, so why aren’t you asleep yet? Aren’t you tired from work?”</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao tried her best to sound concerned about him, but her voice came out flat instead, without a trace of emotion. </p> 
 <p>However, Jiang Cheng seemed to be particularly happy after hearing her questions. “No matter how tired I am from work, I don’t feel tired anymore when I see you. Meimei, everything that I’ve done is so that I can stay by your side. Do you understand?”</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao remained silent; she didn’t know how to answer him. She really wanted to say: <em>You want to stay by my side? But, I don’t want to stay by yours! How I wish I could stay as far away as possible from you.</em></p> 
 <p>“Meimei, I’ll find a way to get rid of anyone who hinders us from being together, no matter who it is!”</p> 
 <p>Upon hearing this, Lan Jinyao remained stunned for a moment before hurriedly saying, “I want to sleep now, so you should hurry back and rest!”</p> 
 <p>Afterwards, she turned and closed the window. Even though it was dark in the room, she could still sense the chill that was being emitted from Jiang Cheng’s body at this moment.</p> 
 <p>“Good night!”</p> 
 <p>Jiang Cheng then turned around and walked out of the room. As soon as he’d left, Lan Jinyao immediately heaved a sigh of relief. From the moment Jiang Cheng had brought her back until now, he’d let her live alone in a room and had never forced her. But, Lan Jinyao inwardly knew that he was just putting on an appearance. His perseverance was surely amazing as he liked to patiently hide in the dark while waiting for an opportunity to strike.</p> 
 <p>At this moment, she could sense that Jiang Cheng’s patience was almost at its limit.</p> 
 <p>That night, Lan Jinyao slept soundly. She only woke up when it was nine in the morning, and the moment she opened her eyes, she flashed a bright smile.</p> 
 <p>What had happened last night wasn’t a dream. Fu Bainian had really come to check on her.</p> 
 <p>It was a sunny morning, so as soon as Lan Jinyao had finished washing up, she went downstairs to have breakfast. Unexpectedly, Jiang Cheng was still waiting for her. Upon seeing him, Lan Jinyao beamed a smile at him for the first time; she even greeted him with a ‘good morning’.</p> 
 <p>Jiang Cheng looked at her in shock and asked, “In a good mood today?”</p> 
 <p>“Yup, because I had a nice dream yesterday! I dreamt that the box office sales for ‘Twilight’ had surpassed 100 million dollars!”</p> 
 <p>For this kind of non-mainstream and non-commercial film to surpass 100 million dollars, it was indeed an unbelievable and unprecedented achievement. Thus, when Lan Jinyao made up this lie, it didn’t sound out of sorts at all.</p> 
 <p>“Really?” Jiang Cheng also smiled and added, “That’s indeed a dream worth being happy about! I’ll surely make it a reality.”</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao didn’t say another word afterwards. What she truly wanted wasn’t some falsified sales figures manipulated by someone.</p> 
 <p>After they’d finished breakfast, it was already half past nine. Usually, around this time, Jiang Cheng would already be at work, so Lan Jinyao casually asked, “You don’t have to go to work today?”</p> 
 <p>Jiang Cheng was seemingly in a good mood as he happily replied, “No, today I’ll go shopping with you, and tomorrow you must accompany me to a dinner party.”</p> 
 <p>Upon hearing this, the smile tugging at Lan Jinyao’s lips abruptly stiffened.</p> 
 <p><em>If he wanted her to accompany him to a dinner party, then…wouldn’t they run into Fu Bainian?</em></p>
