 <p><b>Chapter 164 - Kidnapped Again (1)</b></p>
 <p><span style>It was a sunny morning, and Lan Jinyao started the day in a very good mood. However, that only lasted for a short while, when her morning sickness hit her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fu Bainian had just driven the car out of the garage and parked it at the front when he heard a sound coming from the house. Fu Bainian frowned and quickly strode inside to check on Lan Jinyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Lan Jinyao heard footsteps coming closer, she wiped away her tears and hurriedly shouted, “Don’t come in!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She looked like a mess now, so she didn’t want Fu Bainian to see her like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, when she spoke, it was too late already. She covered her cheeks and refused to look at Fu Bainian. Their morning had now started awfully all thanks to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s okay; there’s no need to cover it up!” Fu Bainian seized her hand and extended his finger to gently wipe away the tears from the corners of her eyes. “What’s wrong? Is our baby being disobedient?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao pulled him out of the bathroom and said, “It’s like this in the beginning stages of pregnancy. I heard others say: ‘The smarter the baby, the worse the morning sickness becomes during pregnancy’!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She hadn’t heard this before, but she knew that Fu Bainian wouldn’t believe her words easily, so she casually said this in order to change the topic. However, her little trick was still seen through by Fu Bainian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re throwing up severely like this, so why don’t you just rest at home? As for the production and the crew…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Midway, Fu Bainian was interrupted by Lan Jinyao before he’d finished speaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, I can still go. The most basic quality actors have to respect their work. Currently, the crew is waiting for us, so how can we tell them midway that we aren’t going?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She willfully covered Fu Bainian’s mouth and prevented him from saying anything more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Fu Bainian had a worried look on his face, he still let her have her way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s hear what the doctor has to say!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s best we do a check-up at the hospital!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two said almost in unison. As soon as their words fell, they looked at each other and laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao then said, “Our chemistry is quite good!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon hearing this, Fu Bainian nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was their tacit understanding good or bad? Neither of them could tell yet, and they could only wait for the doctor to decide.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they arrived at the hospital, Lan Jinyao went to do the examination, and Fu Bainian was waiting outside the room. Here, it seemed that a new baby was born into this world almost every day as loud cries could be heard throughout the corridor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fu Bainian followed the cries and stopped in front of the nursery. In there, he saw lively newborns in the little cradles. In the future, their baby would also be like this, brimming with vitality.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he stared at those little figures, the corners of Fu Bainian’s lips raised slightly, revealing a gentle smile. </span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, a man passed behind Fu Bainian in a rush. Only when he heard a nurse screaming did he suddenly turn around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Someone took a newborn-”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as Fu Bainian turned around, he saw a man holding a baby and about to come out from the back door of the nursery. And, when the nurse’s voice rang, the man became flustered, his pace suddenly quickening as he ran and stumbled towards the exit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Without a second thought, Fu Bainian gave chase.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Following this, Fu Bainian caught the man at the hospital’s entrance; seizing the baby and giving the little one back to the nurse. When Fu Bainian twisted the perpetrator’s arm, that man, who seemed to be in his thirties, suddenly began wailing. His tears streamed down his cheeks like a river, and he had a runny nose. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother, please spare me. I’m just trying to make ends meet!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he said that, the nurse with the child in her arms reprimanded him. “Make ends meet?! Why do you have to kidnap and sell newborns when you’re just trying to make ends meet? If you’d succeeded and the parents of the newborn learnt about this, how are we supposed to explain this to them?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the thought of the possible consequences, the nurse’s eyes instantly reddened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man knelt on the ground and begged for mercy. “I really didn’t steal the baby. Someone gave me money and asked me to bring the baby out, and then bring him back later!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both Fu Bainian and the nurse were baffled by his words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The nurse then murmured, “He was asked to take the baby out and then return him later? If it’s not the baby, then what did that person want? This is truly strange!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fu Bainian let go of the man and turned around to walk back in. However, at that moment, he suddenly saw a familiar figure at the entrance, and he immediately quickened his pace and ran towards the Gynaecology Department.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That person wore the same clothes and had the same hairstyle.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>If he didn’t see wrongly, then that familiar figure must be Jiang Cheng.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>If that man earlier didn’t steal the baby and was just asked to bring the baby out, then what was the motive behind this? </span></i><span style>Fu Bainian stood there and thought hard about this and then, suddenly, a thought dawned on him as he connected the dots.</span><i><span style> Lan Jinyao was in danger!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>No, if that really was Jiang Cheng, then Jinyao shouldn’t be in danger.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But, that man has already lost his mind, so maybe Jinyao was indeed in danger.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Fu Bainian didn’t dare slow down his pace, and while he was running back to check on Jinyao, he almost ran into a patient.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the Gynaecology Department, someone suddenly knocked on the door. Lan Jinyao, who was in the midst of discussing her recent condition with the doctor, suddenly stopped speaking and headed towards the door to open it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The rhythmic knocking on the door stopped after two knocks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Lan Jinyao opened the door, there was no one. A lot of people were passing by, including doctors, nurses and patients, but none of them stopped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, as she lowered her head, she saw a beautiful rose on the floor; it seemed to be a rose that had been freshly picked from a rose garden as it held glistening dewdrops. She quickly picked it up and turned to look at the rigorous-looking aunt in her fifties and smiled. </span><i><span style>The doctor was seemingly quite romantic despite her age.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Auntie, someone must’ve left this for you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao didn't expect the doctor to be such a romantic, and she was quite envious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The gynaecologist looked puzzled and angrily rebuked, “What are you talking about? I have a husband!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly being reprimanded like this startled Lan Jinyao. After a while, she smiled and said, “Don’t tell me it’s for me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Gynecologist shook her head and said, “Youngsters nowadays just like to show off their affection and how foolishly romantic they are. Maybe it’s from your husband?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>From Fu Bainian? No way. Why would he suddenly send her flowers? Truth be told, Fu Bainian wasn’t a very romantic person. Not to mention, not even intimate words of endearment had been said by him before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Speak of the devil, Fu Bainian had arrived and was gasping for air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao stared at his uneven breathing and laughed inwardly. </span><i><span style>Continue pretending.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>She acted as if she was going to throw the flowers into the trash can, yet Fu Bainian calmly asked, instead of stopping her, “Who sent you the roses?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao froze and stared at him. It looked like he wasn’t putting on an act.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You weren’t the one who sent it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, both of them fell silent.</span></p>
