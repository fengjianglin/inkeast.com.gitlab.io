 <p><b>Chapter 160 - Drawing A Clear Line (3)</b></p>
 <p><span style>Everything under the bright sunshine was enveloped with a warm glow. However, Lan Jinyao felt that there was an icy, tingling sensation running throughout her body, spreading to her limbs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yin Yun proudly smirked and said, “You’re right. Fu Bainian did look for me to put on a show for you, and as you’ve said, he didn’t want you to worry. But, in fact, there’s another reason why he did that. Do you know what that is?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She then unhurriedly stressed, “The other reason that he didn’t want to tell you, do you know what that is?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao’s expression turned cold as she said, “I don’t know, and I don’t want to know. We are doing very well now, so we don’t need another insignificant person to worry about us.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Yin Yun had definitely come with ill intentions and an ulterior motive. This woman must be here to agitate her. No matter what this woman wanted to say next, she shouldn’t listen to her words. Besides, her emotions weren’t very stable at the moment.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Chen Meimei, stop deceiving yourself. I can see from your eyes and expression that you really want to know.” Yin Yun’s smile suddenly turned eerie; she looked like a restless venomous snake who was waiting for the right opportunity to make its move.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao ignored her and moved to close the door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Yin Yun was unwilling to give up and quickly grabbed the doorframe with both hands, not allowing Lan Jinyao to close the door. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chen Meimei, what are you afraid of? In fact, you were right. At first, I just wanted to cooperate with President Fu to put on a good show, and then accept the reward I ought to get. However, things are different now. I’ve fallen in love with him. He’s such a charming man, so which women wouldn’t be moved by him? Besides, you were the one who granted me this opportunity. Even someone as unbearable as you could marry into the Fu family and stay by his side. I’m much more outstanding than you, so I believe that as long as I work hard, then Mrs Fu’s position will eventually be mine.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>As long as you work hard, you’ll make him fall in love with you? That kind of logic was ridiculous. As if love could be cultivated so easily like that! Not to mention, Fu Bainian already had her in his heart.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao chuckled and eyed her with a piercing gaze as she said, “Let me tell you again; that wish of yours will never come true. I advise you to stop being so delusional.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The person who Fu Bainian had loved all along was never Chen Meimei, but Lan Jinyao. Even though the host of her soul was someone else, the one who Fu Bainian liked was still her, Lan Jinyao.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao coldly glared at Yin Yun as she removed her hands from the doorframe, and she then proceeded to close the door. When she was not paying attention, Yin Yun quickly extended her hand again. Lan Jinyao felt that she didn’t use a lot of strength while closing the door, but an earth-shattering shriek echoed in her ears the moment Yin Yun’s hand was caught in the door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Subconsciously, she let go of her hand, and the door opened. She then saw Yin Yun’s injured fingers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fair skin on Yin Yun’s fingers instantly turned dark red, and a mark was left close to the joints. There were even a few drops of tears visible in the corners of her eyes. Lan Jinyao suddenly felt that Yin Yun’s expression wasn’t exaggerated at all. Yin Yun covered her fingers, and her lips quivered as she let out a low whimper.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao could already feel the pain while looking at her. “Are you okay? You were the one who extended your hand, so it’s not my fault.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Had it not been for Yin Yun’s sudden movement, then she would have reacted on time, and her fingers wouldn’t have been caught in the door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yin Yun suddenly lifted her head and glared at Lan Jinyao with a pair of red eyes. “What do you mean it’s not your fault? Chen Meimei, you were the one who caused this injury.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao was somewhat speechless when she heard this. She didn’t want to be entangled with this irrational woman any longer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the next second, a loud slap was heard, and Lan Jinyao froze on the spot. Yin Yun had viciously slapped her; half of her cheek had turned red and was now burning. The pain was so intense that it felt as if her cheek had been smeared with a layer of chilli oil.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao gently touched her cheek, and then quickly removed her fingers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yin Yun was abnormally strong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao had initially wanted to endure the pain, but Yin Yun refused to back down, and she pounced on Lan Jinyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you want?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yin Yun actually tried to strangle her, but Lan Jinyao subconsciously countered her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two women fought, with Yin Yun pulling Lan Jinyao’s hair, and Lan Jinyao throwing a punch, hitting the bridge of Yin Yun’s nose. Yin Yun’s high nose had seemingly undergone plastic surgery, and it now looked slightly crooked after Lan Jinyao’s hit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahhh!” a scream sounded again. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chen Meimei, you’re courting death! How dare you hit me?!” Yin Yun, who had lost all rationality, glared at Lan Jinyao with bloodshot eyes. </span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Lan Jinyao’s eyes abruptly widened, and her heart seemed to stop beating when Yin Yun’s punch was about to land on her abdomen. Yin Yun was quite strong, so a possible outcome instantly flashed through Lan Jinyao’s mind. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Currently, it was like all movements had seemingly slowed down. Lan Jinyao couldn’t stop the hand that was about to reach her, and Yin Yun’s sinister expression gradually closed in on her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you doing?!” a raspy male voice suddenly sounded behind them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Yin Yun’s hand, which was mere centimetres away, was forcefully grabbed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was at this instant that Lan Jinyao looked up at Jiang Cheng, who’d appeared in front of her, gasping for air. A moment ago, she’d felt her heart in her throat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yin Yun glared at Jiang Cheng and said, “Let go of me! I want to sort out this woman a bit. That role was originally the reward that President Fu had promised me, but now it's been snatched away by this woman. Just because she’s President Fu’s wife means that I deserve to be humiliated by her?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Humiliated? This woman was truly good with her words!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao’s eyes turned cold, and she stated, “Quickly get out of here, or I’ll make it so that you’re unable to stand in the entertainment industry again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In fact, she didn’t have to do anything at all. If Fu Bainian knew that Yin Yun had nearly made them lose their baby, then Yin Yun would never be able to stay in the entertainment industry. No, in fact, she wouldn’t even be able to stay in this city.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chen Meimei, you’re so lucky; why is everyone protecting you? You still don’t know the real reason, right? Then, I’ll tell you…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Cheng immediately covered Yin Yun’s mouth, and in that split second, a fierce glint emerged in his eyes, frightening Lan Jinyao. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A bold assumption suddenly emerged within Lan Jinyao's mind. </span><i><span style>Maybe the real reason behind Fu Bainian's injury was related to Jiang Cheng. </span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Fu Bainian got hurt, and Jiang Cheng had something to do with it!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A perplexed look emerged in Lan Jinyao’s eyes, but she was no longer afraid.</span></p>
