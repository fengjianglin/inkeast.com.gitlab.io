 <p><b>Chapter 146 - A Battle Of Wits Against Yin Yun (3)</b></p>
 <p><span style>When the banquet ended, Lan Jinyao took the initiative to go outside. She stood at the hotel’s doorway and waited for Fu Bainian. Tonight, no matter if he were going home or not, she’d keep him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing Lan Jinyao leave, Jiang Cheng instantly followed her out. After she’d waited for a while, Jiang Cheng went to stand next to her and whispered, “I brought you here; do you need me to be a gentleman and send you back?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need!” Lan Jinyao immediately declined his offer. “Bainian is coming out soon, so I’ll just wait for him to go home together.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Cheng sneered with a sarcastic smile and said, “Go home together? As far as I know, President Fu hasn’t been living at home for a long time already. I bet that you guys haven’t even shared a bed for quite a while, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao was speechless when Jiang Cheng asked this. He was telling the truth, so upon hearing this, Lan Jinyao’s hands instantly clenched into fists.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a long moment of silence, Lan Jinyao suddenly asked, “You seem to be very clear about Fu Bainian’s matters? You even know when he comes home and when he doesn’t!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao felt as if she’d touched the source of his scheme.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment this question was asked, Jiang Cheng’s face suddenly darkened, and Lan Jinyao keenly noticed this. She then neared him a little and inquired further. “You’re secretly investigating Fu Bainian, and know about his each and every move, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So, what if that’s true?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Cheng was seen through by Lan Jinyao, so he simply admitted to it. However, Lan Jinyao, on the other, froze when he did so.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you doing that?” It was very unbelievable for someone as straightforward and upright as him to resort to these kinds of despicable means.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Cheng had seemingly read her mind as he mockingly said, “I’ve never said that I was a straightforward and upright person. Additionally, I’ve also never said that I wouldn’t resort to despicable and shameless means. You were the one who thought of me like that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As to why I’m doing all of that, I thought you knew already.” Jiang Cheng paused for a second before lowering his voice and whispering in her ear, “I want you. You belong to me, not to Fu Bainian.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, he no longer addressed Fu Bainian as ‘President Fu’, but directly addressed him by his name. His voice was brimming with possessiveness, which frightened Lan Jinyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Lan Jinyao quickly pushed him away and said, “I’ve never belonged to you! Jiang Cheng, if possible, I’d rather not have you in my life.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Cheng’s expression instantly sunk upon hearing this one sentence. “I’ll leave first!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He seemingly hated to hear her say those kinds of hurtful words. He briskly turned around and left, his figure quickly disappearing into the distance as he bolted away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao slightly frowned as she stared at his disappearing figure. </span><i><span style>The one that Jiang Cheng liked; was that her, Lan Jinyao, or Chen Meimei? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed that she could only now grasp Jiang Cheng’s intentions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Following that, Fu Bainian came up behind her and asked, “What did he say to you just now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His sudden appearance startled Lan Jinyao. She abruptly turned around and saw Fu Bainian standing there with one hand placed on his belt, and also Yin Yun, who stubbornly clung to him like glue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao shook her head and was going to say it was nothing, but when her words came out of her mouth, they changed again. “He told me to pay attention as there’s a certain someone harbouring ulterior motives out there who is eyeing the ‘Mrs. Fu’ position.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing this, Fu Bainian lightly glanced at Yin Yun and then dully said, “No, that won’t happen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao haughtily smiled and took Fu Bainian’s hand before coquettishly saying in a low voice, “Let’s go home together!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her smile seemed to have returned to the same smile as before; it was so pure, it gently stirred his heart. Thus, Fu Bainian couldn’t help but nod.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Afterwards, Lan Jinyao smiled triumphantly at Yin Yun, and then walked away with Fu Bainian, side by side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Yin Yun was angrily yelling behind them, “Fu Bainian-”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fu Bainian halted and, at the same time, Lan Jinyao’s heart skipped a beat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“President Fu, are you sure you want to go back with Chen Meimei?” Yin Yun solemnly asked. “Are you certain about that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Lan Jinyao’s intuition told her that there must be something going on between Yin Yun and Fu Bainian that she didn’t know about. But, this had absolutely nothing to do with love, because when Fu Bainian was looking at Yin Yun, his gaze was utterly devoid of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao suddenly tightened her grip on Fu Bainian’s hand. Her fingertips were a bit cold, and Fu Bainian felt it. He slightly turned his face and saw a feeble pleading look in Lan Jinyao’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Don’t go...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Her eyes seemed to be conveying this to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fu Bainian hesitated for a moment before finally telling Yin Yun, “You go back by yourself! I’m...going home tonight!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon hearing this, Lan Jinyao’s expression instantly lightened up like a ray of lovely spring sunshine and flowers in full bloom. Fu Bainian blankly stared at her for a long while before his lips curled up into a faint smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hubby, let’s go home!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She then looked back at Yin Yun, who seemed to be furious as she stood there, staring at them for a long time. Her eyes were burning with anger, yet she didn’t say another word after that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao was particularly happy and was softly humming a song in the front passenger seat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Fu Bainian saw that bright smile on her face, he suddenly felt that his dull mood from the past few days had immediately disappeared into nothingness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You seem very happy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao couldn’t help but smile. “Of course!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fu Bainian didn’t understand why she was so happy, because he didn’t know that in the past she’d been depressed to the point that her heart had almost drowned with despair. There had been countless moments where she’d told herself: </span><i><span style>Forget it, even if you can’t go on, don’t let yourself feel sad and don’t hurt your heart.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, she’d persevered and told herself: </span><i><span style>Fu Bainian wasn’t that kind of person. Although he’d done those hurtful things, he must’ve had his reasons for doing so and couldn’t tell her his feelings.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Why...did you show up with Jiang Cheng today?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fu Bainian was somewhat hesitant when he asked this. He focused on the road ahead, but his hands were tightly gripping the steering wheel, and this movement exposed his inner tension.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Lan Jinyao heard this, she smiled all the more brightly and asked back, “Do you care about that a lot?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The answer she got was, without doubt, silence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao deliberately waited for a while before answering, “That’s because Jiang Cheng had said that he was going to take me to catch a couple in the act. As a result, I went there and saw you with Yin Yun.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She suddenly lowered her voice, and pretended to be fierce as she ferociously stated, “Fu Bainian, let me tell you, I absolutely won’t divorce you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao stared into Fu Bainian’s eyes and repeated, “I absolutely refuse!”</span></p>
