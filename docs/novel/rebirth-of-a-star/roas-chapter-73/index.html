 <p><strong>Chapter 73 - Cold War (3)</strong></p>
 <p>“Quiet, the President’s wife is here!”</p>
 <p>When Lan Jinyao, who was wearing sunglasses, stepped into the building, she heard the girl at the front desk whispering when she passed them.</p>
 <p>Her expression didn’t change and she just kept walking to the elevator. The moment before the elevator doors closed, she saw the two girls at the front desk lean closer to each other again from the corner of her eye.</p>
 <p>The higher the elevator went, the stranger the atmosphere became; especially when she arrived at the office and saw the weird look that Li Qi was giving her.</p>
 <p>“Is there something on my face?”</p>
 <p>Li Qi frantically shook his head. “N-no. I just want to ask: did you somehow provoke President Fu? Or, do you two not have harmonious night activities? I heard that when President Fu was in the meeting this morning, he scolded everyone because of a small mistake!”</p>
 <p>“Why does this have anything to do with me?” If someone must be angry, then it should be her. Whenever she recalled those two people hugging so intimately a few days ago, her heart always turned sour.</p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao’s expression was too innocent, so Li Qi slightly doubted her. “Does it really have nothing to do with you? Everyone in the company thinks it does, and even President Fu’s best friend, Shen Yu, thinks so too.”</p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao: “...”</p>
 <p>“Anyway, enough about that, let’s talk business! The company just accepted a group of newcomers, so you’ll be training with them. I’ve also arranged all your upcoming appointments into a schedule for you. After one month, you’ll be going to the audition. In addition, there’ll be an advertisement around the same time so you can do them together!”</p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao stood there listening to Li Qi’s endless talk and had to pause him with a gesture, as she noticed that the more he talked; the more excited he grew.</p>
 <p>“You sounds like you have confidence in me?” As far as she knew, he’d used to avoid Chen Meimei in the past.</p>
 <p>Li Qi smiled with embarrassment. “Hey, that was the past, things are different now. What’s more, you’ve never participated in any training, but you’re already such a pro. To say that you’re a genius wouldn’t be a lie.”</p>
 <p>Those words were what he honestly felt. Li Qi had never met such a good actress before who’d never undergone any training; it was if she was born with a natural talent for the entertainment industry. Her talent had astonished him and won him over. At the time Chen Meimei had sought him out, it was the wisest decision she could’ve made, even though she’d been ridiculed by him.</p>
 <p>“There’s the final announcement for Rouge Fermentation this afternoon, and after that, you’ll need to come to the company for training starting tomorrow!”</p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao propped her chin up and asked him, “That’s it?”</p>
 <p>“That’s it. What else would there be?”</p>
 <p>“So, you called me to the company today just to tell me about my work schedule?” <em>You could’ve just said all that over the phone, alright? Why bother making me come here?!</em></p>
 <p>Li Qi only replied with a grin, which Lan Jinyao detected the hint of a plot from.</p>
 <p>“Okay! Actually, Shen Yu told me that he would owe me a favour if I called you.”</p>
 <p>Just after he said that Shen Yu strode in.</p>
 <p>Li Qi patted Lan Jinyao’s shoulder and said to her on his way out, “Just give me a call this afternoon, I’ll pick you up then!”</p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao didn’t move from her seat as she watched Shen Yu sit down on the seat Li Qi had vacated a moment ago. She didn’t say anything and just waited for Shen Yu to explain his reasons for calling her over.</p>
 <p>Unexpectedly, once Shen Yu sat down, he sighed and asked her, “You feel it too, right? The cold atmosphere in the company.” He pointed upstairs.</p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao shrugged. “It really has nothing to do with me!”</p>
 <p>Shen Yu intently stared at her, not making a sound.</p>
 <p>They continued staring at each other for a good while before Lan Jinyao decided to compromise. “Okay okay, just wait, the relationship between us will get better.” <em>As long as that woman leaves, things will definitely get better.</em></p>
 <p>Fu Bainian didn’t understand where a woman’s sense of security came from. It didn’t matter how childish the opponent was as everything depended on his attitude, and, unfortunately, it was this that had caused Xu Jin’ge to become so unyielding. This in turn had led to her continuously stepping between them.</p>
 <p>Now, Shen Yu was forced to feel a sense of powerlessness. It was just like the saying: the emperor isn’t worried, but his eunuchs are worried to death.</p>
 <p>“Alright. I have to go downstairs for a stroll now, do you want to go down together?” Lan Jinyao then stood up and left the room.</p>
 <p>Once Shen Yu was left alone in the office, he released a long sigh.</p>
 <p>He felt that the most challenging conversations were with stubborn women. In the past, it was Lan Jinyao, and now, it was Chen Meimei. He felt that there was nothing but headaches waiting for him in the future.</p>
 <p>“President Fu, you should ask for more happiness for yourself!”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>In a quiet cafe, Xu Jin’ge was leaning against the window as she slowly stirred the coffee in front of her with a spoon. On the seat opposite her, there was a pile of bags from many famous clothing brands.</p>
 <p>Fu Changning had gone to the lavatory, but she might be returning soon.</p>
 <p>Xu Jin’ge looked a little nervous, her eyes never straying from the bags opposite her.</p>
 <p>A minute later, Fu Changning returned to her seat. She was a young and beautiful girl, her bright eyes gleaming. They were the kind of eyes that could steal everyone’s attention.</p>
 <p>She stared straight at Xu Jin’ge, and suddenly, she extended her hand and shook it in front of Xu Jin’ge’s face. “Jin’ge, are you okay? Why do you look so worried?”</p>
 <p>Xu Jin’ge looked depressed, her eyes revealing a glimpse of sorrow. Truth be told, acting wasn’t difficult for her, let alone acting in front of a girl who was so naive.</p>
 <p>“Changning, I’m leaving. I’m going abroad!”</p>
 <p>Fu Changning didn’t notice the hidden meaning behind her sentence. She said with a smile, “That’s good. Are you going to enter Hollywood? Goodness, then you’ll definitely be more amazing in the future. I really envy you!”</p>
 <p>Xu Jin’ge let out a long sigh. “Where is it that good? How can things overseas compare to your hometown, your friends?”</p>
 <p>She’d now explained things clearly enough, so Fu Changning finally understood.</p>
 <p>“Jin’ge, judging from your tone, it seems that you don’t want to go abroad?” she asked in confusion. “But, why?”</p>
 <p>Xu Jin’ge continued sighing and didn’t explain further, but Fu Changning seemed to understand as she exclaimed, “Ooh! I understand. You don’t want to part with my brother, right? Because my brother has always been in the country, you aren’t willing to leave, right?”</p>
 <p>Xu Jin’ge nodded as she looked at Fu Changning with an expectant look. “Can you help me? I want to stay here.”</p>
 <p>“Then just don’t go abroad!” <em>Isn’t this easily solved? Why did Jin’ge need her help?</em> Fu Changning didn’t quite understand.</p>
 <p>Xu Jin’ge’s hands were quietly clenched, and she showed an aggrieved expression as she whispered, “But, Bainian wishes for me to go abroad. He’s worried that I’ll destroy the relationship between him and Chen Meimei. However, he clearly doesn’t like Chen Meimei.”</p>
 <p>“Then, how do you want me to help you?”</p>
 <p>The little fish had taken the bait. A corner of Xu Jin’ge mouth curved ever so faintly. It was so faint that it went unnoticed.</p>
 <p>“Come here, I’ll tell you…”</p>
 <p>In the cafe, the two women drew closer to each other and started whispering.</p>
