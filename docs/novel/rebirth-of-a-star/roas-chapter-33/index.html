 <p><strong>Chapter 33 - I Don’t Need Your Help (2)</strong></p>
 <p>The shooting of A Thousand Years of Tears was right around the corner, but Lan Jinyao was still without an Agent. Just as she was worrying about this, Fu Bainian appeared.</p>
 <p>It seemed that in the past few days this man had been doing well. He was wearing an expensive suit, his leather shoes were clean and shiny, and the front of his hair was combed back; he was as suave as a western male model.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing that he was doing quite well, Lan Jinyao felt somewhat displeased; this person didn’t seem to be feeling the slightest bit of guilt. Moreover, he appeared to be full of joy, so when he stood in front of her, she felt that his presence was particularly irksome.</p>
 <p>She pretended that she didn’t see him and went to walk past him. But, the moment she passed him, her arm was caught in a tight grip.</p>
 <p>“Chen Meimei, I’ll keep my promise! Regarding the role you want, I’ll arrange it all for you!”</p>
 <p><em>So, this man had specifically found her to say this? Wasn’t he here about them getting a divorce?</em></p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao grunted and shook off his hand. “There’s no need; I’m capable of doing that by myself and confident that I can obtain the role with my own abilities. What if you trick me again after you’ve helped me? What should I do then, huh?”</p>
 <p>Ever since she’d entered the entertainment circle, things had been nothing but smooth sailing for her. However, after her rebirth, she’d experienced many stumbling blocks obstructing her path. She could ignore what others thought of her, but it was impossible for her to ignore her wounded heart. Her heart was now broken and had been shattered into a million pieces. The pain was constantly there as the wound hadn’t yet had a chance to heal.</p>
 <p>“Chen Meimei, you’ve lost a lot of weight.”</p>
 <p>With her nose in the air, she continued arrogantly, “Humph! I don’t need you to tell me that, I can see it myself.”</p>
 <p>Fu Bainian said again, “You’ve also changed a lot!”</p>
 <p>“Haha!” Lan Jinyao sneered as she continued, “Don’t flatter me. What I look like now, and how I’ll look in the future; I’m the one who knows it clearest.”</p>
 <p>“Chen Meimei, can you not act like this? Are you even capable of getting that role by yourself? All of the roles already have candidates, and you don’t have a resume. So, why would they switch out someone who’s already been chosen?” Fu Bainian’s brows wrinkled slightly, and his tone became unfriendly.</p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao glared at this arrogant man and said, “You’re out of your mind! Yeah, I don’t have a resume, but just wait and see! I’ll get that role.”</p>
 <p><em>It was just a minor supporting role. Was it worth him personally attending to this matter?</em></p>
 <p>“You...Chen Meimei, regarding our wedding, that was indeed my fault. But, at that time, Lan Xin was involved in a car accident, and I had to send her to the hospital!” His tone was somewhat helpless.</p>
 <p>His voice sounded like it was filled with powerlessness, but, unfortunately, it would be difficult to extinguish the fire in Lan Jinyao’s heart.</p>
 <p>She looked straight at him, and asked menacingly, “She was involved in a car accident? Did she break her hand or her leg? It doesn’t matter that you had to send her to the hospital, but why did you turn your phone off? Don’t you know that day was important? Even though it all would've been pretend, don’t you have even the tiniest sense of responsibility?”</p>
 <p>She didn’t want to talk so harshly as such behaviour was opposite to her personality. However, she couldn’t control herself. In front of Fu Bainian, she felt that she’d become a madman who didn’t care about anything; someone who would act like a rabid dog that bit whoever came into view. Knowing this made her feel even more irritable.</p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao didn’t want to talk to this man anymore.</p>
 <p>However, the most irritating thing in the world was that, when you obviously didn’t want to talk to someone, that someone would delay you and prevent you from leaving. At this moment, Fu Bainian was acting exactly like this. He was so fixated on trying to explain everything clearly that Lan Jinyao figured that he just wanted to relieve his guilt.</p>
 <p>“That day, my phone ran out of battery!”</p>
 <p>“Then, why you didn’t come?”</p>
 <p>No excuse was important as what she’d experienced due to his actions was being stood up and becoming infamous.</p>
 <p>“Because...Lan Xin was in pain that day. She didn’t want me to leave!”</p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao nodded to indicate that she understood. That woman hadn’t wanted him to leave, so he’d stood her up. After all, that woman was wearing a face that he’d loved for years. It was evident at a glance who was and wasn’t important to him. In fact, there was no need to compare the two sides at all, because, when she’d confronted Lan Xin, she’d been utterly defeated.</p>
 <p>“Look, you’ve already explained yourself clearly, but it’s of no use because there’s no meaning to it anymore! I’m not going to forgive you just because of your explanation! Moreover, I’ve already told you before that we’ll be strangers the next time we meet! As for that divorce certificate, you can give me a call when you’re free, and I’ll definitely cooperate...”</p>
 <p>She paused for a moment before adding, “I would never be like a certain someone and keep you waiting!”</p>
 <p>After saying all of this she nonchalantly left, leaving Fu Bainian to stand in place for a long time. It could be said that he was furious with her as he glared at her departing back.</p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao couldn’t understand what Fu Bainian was thinking, and she didn’t want to understand. For now, all she wanted to do was focus on her work, because her enemy was still at large.</p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao was sitting in the cafe downstairs and thinking about what she should do next when she realised that the road ahead would be long and filled with obstacles. When she’d bluntly refused Fu Bainian’s offer of help just now, she hadn’t really thought about the role at hand, and she was now starting to develop a headache. Although she was familiar with the Director of A Thousand Years Of Tears, she was now Chen Meimei; it would be awkward if she just acted all friendly with him out of nowhere, right?</p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao sat there with her chin propped in the palm of her hand, her eyes spinning with her endless thoughts. Even though she could think of countless ideas, she ended up discarding them because they were either too stupid or completely unfeasible.</p>
 <p>Half an hour later, Li Qi sat in front of her with a goofy grin on his face. After the waiter had brought him a cup of coffee, he continued to smile while biting on the spoon.</p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao stretched out her hand and swiftly placed it on his forehead to check his temperature. “You don’t seem to have a fever, so what’s up with that silly expression?”</p>
 <p>“I’m smiling because something good happened to me!”</p>
 <p>After momentarily pondering what he’d said, Lan Jinyao realised what was going on.</p>
 <p>“She accepted you?”</p>
 <p>Li Qi’s smile was like a blooming chrysanthemum as he grinned from ear to ear. “Yes! I don’t know which fool did it, but every day he sent flowers to Little Yun. And, to my surprise, Little Yun thought that I sent them, so she agreed to date me. Don’t you think that it’s a blessing from the heavens? I struck it lucky this time!”</p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao, who was now regarded as a fool, silently rolled her eyes.</p>
 <p>She then asked in an eerie voice, “Tell me, which fool do you think it was that would send flowers to He Xiaoyun, making sure to send it under your name?”</p>
 <p>Li Qi extended his hand and flicked her forehead. “I just knew it was you! You did a good deed, but you didn’t leave your name behind. Chen Meimei, no matter what you’re plotting, just say it! If it’s something I can help you with, I’ll help!”</p>
 <p>When Lan Jinyao saw that he was straightforwardly thanking her, she stopped beating around the bush and bluntly said, “Alright! I want you to be my Agent.”</p>
