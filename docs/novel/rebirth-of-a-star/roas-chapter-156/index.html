 <p><b>Chapter 156 - Audition (2)</b></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao got up early in the morning. When she’d rested at home these past days, she didn’t put on any make-up. Only today did she put on some light makeup, and hurriedly prepared to go out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fu Bainian was already waiting for her outside. When Lan Jinyao walked over, she heard Fu Bainian honking at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Get in!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao then said, “I texted Li Qi yesterday. He and Xiaolin will come to pick me up later.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fu Bainian opened the door and said, “Li Qi won’t come, we’ll go there together. In any case, when the audition starts, I’ll go over to take a look too.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao then instantly understood. No wonder Fu Bainian had compromised so easily last night. She’d initially thought that he’d agreed due to her constant nagging, but in fact, Fu Bainian had dug a hole and was waiting for her here. Chen Zetao had said that Fu Bainian might go to the audition, and now it turned out that he would go. It was likely that he would give Yin Yun extra points and fail her instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After getting in the car, Lan Jinyao grabbed him by the collar and asked, “Not only are you going, but Yin Yun, that woman, will also be there, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fu Bainian gently removed her hand from his collar and smiled as he said, “This was what I had promised Yin Yun before. I had asked her to put on an act with me, and this is her reward. Of course, whether she’ll be chosen in the end will depend on her own efforts and acting skills.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao threw away his hand, and her temper flared once more. “Put on an act? Which husband finds another woman to act in front of his wife, forcing his wife to feel miserable?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She scolded and pinched Fu Bainian, her expression and tone were very much like that of the former Chen Meimei. However, after a while, she suddenly stopped scolding him. Something occurred to her, and then all the sad memories replayed in her mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing her suddenly stop, Fu Bainian stared at her in surprise, and asked, “What’s wrong?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she didn’t speak, Fu Bainian became somewhat nervous, and asked again, “Are you not feeling well again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao then abruptly asked, “I just remembered something. You said that you had asked Yin Yun to put on an act, and I’d initially thought that the audience of this play was me. But, thinking about it again, I feel that something’s off. Another person is a part of the audience, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Lan Jinyao felt as if she’d dug up a part of the truth behind Fu Bainian’s injury. Up until now, she’d always thought that Fu Bainian and Yin Yun had put on an act for her, but according to her understanding of Fu Bainian’s character, he wasn’t a person who’d do something like this. Besides, all of this began the day after Fu Bainian had returned from his business trip.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao’s voice started to tremble as she spoke, “The person who hurt you is someone near us, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fu Bainian looked at the road ahead, and his lips remained tightly shut, resisting the urge to answer this question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, sometimes, silence itself was the best answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao then indifferently said, “I understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person who’d hurt Fu Bainian must be someone by their side, and since that person had managed to hurt Fu Bainian, he must be someone very familiar with them. She must undoubtedly seek that person out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ve arrived, you can get off here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fu Bainian got out of the car first, and then opened the door for her and helped her out of the car. His movements were extremely gentle, but his expression didn’t look very good. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why the long face? Do I owe you money?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, give me a smile!” Lan Jinyao gestured and pinched Fu Bainian’s face, but he didn’t avoid her and let her do as she wished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao then burst into laughter and teased, “President Fu, you sure are cooperative today!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fu Bainian’s expression softened, and he held her hand to go inside. Meanwhile, in the corner of a building behind them, someone from the paparazzi was holding up a camera and continuously photographing the interactions between the two of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seemingly noticing something, Fu Bainian looked over to the corner and revealed a gentle smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chen Zetao was already waiting at the door, and as soon as Lan Jinyao entered, he laughed and said, “You’re here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His laughter was jovial, but when he saw Fu Bainian standing next to Lan Jinyao, his smile slightly dwindled, and he politely added, “President Fu, you’re also here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fu Bainian acknowledged him before letting go of Lan Jinyao’s hand and marching towards his office, looking somewhat unhappy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many artists had come to audition today. Most of them had come because of Chen Zetao’s distinguished name, and a small part were attending for the intriguing script. As for Yin Yun, she’d come for Fu Bainian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao saw Yin Yun as soon as she stepped inside. That woman was gorgeously dressed, like a peacock fanning its feathers. When their gazes met, Yin Yun contemptuously smiled at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao inwardly thought: </span><i><span style>Go ahead and laugh, just don’t cry later.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, to Lan Jinyao’s surprise, Fu Bainian had unexpectedly thrown a wrench in the works. He was determined to fail her and not let her participate in this movie’s production.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon after, it was Lan Jinyao’s turn, with Yin Yun’s turn right after her. Although the staff had uniformly agreed that a computer would be used to select the order of the participants, this didn’t imply that there would be no under-the-table manipulations. Lan Jinyao felt that the reason she was lined up in front of Yin Yun, and had managed to obtain so many advantages, was all thanks to Chen Zetao helping her behind the scenes. Chen Zetao was so confident that she would come, he’d arranged everything even before he’d gotten a definite answer from her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Lan Jinyao entered the audition room, she saw Chen Zetao seated at the second station. He smiled at her, and Lan Jinyao returned his smile out of politeness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon seeing this, Fu Bainian’s expression instantly darkened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For the movie ‘Twilight’, the characters had a lot of internal monologues. So, for this audition, Lan Jinyao had to read a segment of a character’s internal monologues with her expression and her voice on point.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had done this type of challenging film before, so she felt that everything was going smoothly when she performed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, while everyone was immersed in her brilliant performance, halfway through her segment, someone suddenly interrupted and yelled ‘stop’.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In that instant, Lan Jinyao was almost suffocated to death by her own breath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She stopped and stared angrily at Fu Bainian. If it hadn’t been for the fact that there were too many people present now, she would've rushed up to argue with Fu Bainian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao was fuming with anger, yet Fu Bainian’s expression was as indifferent as usual.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“President Fu, was there something wrong with my performance? Is that why you yelled stop before I finished my segment?” she asked with a stifled smile as she desperately suppressed her anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fu Bainian propped his chin up in one hand and humphed as if he was cooking up a decent excuse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And, everyone’s gaze was focused on Fu Bainian, waiting for him to say something.</span></p>
