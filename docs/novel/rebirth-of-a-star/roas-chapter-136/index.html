 <p><strong>Chapter 136 - She’s Merely An Actress</strong></p>
 <p>“Fu Bainian, what on earth do you want? If you want a divorce, just say it! Why make things so complicated, resulting in others seeing me as a joke?”</p>
 <p>Her vision was completely blurred with the tears that continuously streamed down her face, and she couldn’t make out Fu Bainian’s expression anymore.</p>
 <p>Upon hearing that, Fu Bainian’s hand slightly tightened around the magazine in his grip. The veins on the back of his hand were popping out, but he didn’t say anything and didn’t spare Lan Jinyao another glance, his expression immensely cold.</p>
 <p>“But…” Lan Jinyao shook off Yin Yun’s hand and shouted at Fu Bainian, “You won’t get what you’re wishing for! I won’t divorce you!”</p>
 <p>After firing off this one sentence, Lan Jinyao scurried away and nearly ran into a waiter with a serving cart.</p>
 <p>In the room, Yin Yun remained silent and rubbed her aching hand, which was flung away a moment ago. She then walked to the bedside and stood in front of Fu Bainian. “She left, but if she doesn’t want a divorce, it’s going to be difficult to settle this matter. Shall we step up our game?”</p>
 <p>Yin Yun smiled a little ambiguously as she extended her hands towards Fu Bainian’s neck, but her hands were blocked mid-air by Fu Bainian, who warned her with a darkened expression, “Don’t you forget your place.”</p>
 <p>The atmosphere turned a little stiff at this point, so Yin Yun quickly withdrew her hands with a slightly unpleasant expression. At this moment, the waiter with the serving cart also knocked on the door.</p>
 <p>“Okay, don’t be angry anymore, the food is here! Let’s go eat; I’m starving!”</p>
 <p>Soon after, the waiter brought the food in and set the table for them. Yin Yun started eating and asked Fu Bainian, “Aren’t you eating?”</p>
 <p>Fu Bainian didn’t answer her question. Instead, his eyes remained fixed on the latest entertainment magazine in his hand. On the first page was a large photo of him and Yin Yun. The title above the picture was bright red and dazzling to the eyes, which read: <em>Blue Hall Entertainment’s President having an extramarital affair, publicly displaying his affection with his new flame in a high-profile manner.</em></p>
 <p>He exerted a lot of strength with his fingers, and the paper was almost crumpled.</p>
 <p>“What if Chen Meimei doesn’t want to divorce you? What would you do then? But, I’ve heard of Chen Meimei’s past, and it seems that she likes you a lot; she said that she didn’t want a divorce, which was within my expectations. She obviously loves you dearly and finally married you after great difficulty. How could she possibly be willing to give up so easily?”</p>
 <p>After a moment of silence, Fu Bainian closed the magazine in his hand and said, “If she doesn’t want a divorce, then I won’t divorce her!”</p>
 <p>A moment ago, he’d seen how upset she was. The former Lan Jinyao wouldn’t easily cry, and even if she felt sad, she wouldn’t show it. But, she’d cried earlier.</p>
 <p>What shocked Fu Bainian the most was that even though she’d cried like that, she was determined not to divorce him. If it were the old Chen Meimei, he definitely would’ve expected her to say that. But, there was currently another person’s soul in Chen Meimei’s body. The person who he was madly in love with, Lan Jinyao.</p>
 <p><em>Since she’d said that, did that mean that she was on the same page as him? </em></p>
 <p>Thinking up to this point, he felt a surge of happiness in his heart. But, then Fu Bainian remembered what had happened in the past few days, and his brows tightly furrowed together.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao ran out of the hotel crying. She wore a pair of huge sunglasses, but one could still see her tears continuously rolling down her cheeks from under her glasses.</p>
 <p>It was unknown where Fu Changning had heard the news, but she’d rushed over to the hotel. When she saw Lan Jinyao, she quickly grabbed her hand and anxiously asked, “Sis-in-law, what happened? Why are you crying like this? Please tell me what happened, alright? Is my Brother in the hotel? Who else is there?”</p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao kept shaking her head. “I don’t know. Don’t ask me; I don’t know…”</p>
 <p>There were a lot of people going in and out of the hotel. Soon, someone noticed this scene and stopped to take pictures with their mobile. Fu Changning saw this and roared, “What are you taking pictures for?! Haven’t you ever seen a person cry before?!”</p>
 <p>Following that, she grabbed Lan Jinyao’s hand and walked away before hailing a taxi and getting in.</p>
 <p>“Sis-in-law, I’ll go home with you. When we get home, can we talk about it?” Fu Changning looked at her nervously.</p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao’s hand subconsciously stroked her lower abdomen as she nodded. She gazed out of the window, looking slightly dazed.</p>
 <p>When they arrived back home, Lan Jinyao lay on the bed, her mood still as depressed as before, but she was no longer shedding tears.</p>
 <p>Fu Changning sat on the edge of the bed and looked at her anxiously. “Sis-in-law, can you tell me what you saw earlier? In fact, there are many circumstances where what you see with your own eyes may not be true. You’re closely involved in this, so you might not see things clearly, while I’m a spectator who could perceive things more clearly. If you tell me, I can help you analyse the situation.”</p>
 <p>Sometimes, when a person ran into a dead-end, they would panic, and even if they encountered an easy problem, they wouldn’t necessarily be able to come up with a solution to solve it.</p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao nodded. “I understand all this, but what I saw was your Brother and Yin Yun in the same room. Although nothing was happening between them at that moment, it’s impossible to know whether something has happened before.”</p>
 <p>She recalled the scene she saw at the hotel. <em>Back then, when Jiang Cheng had pulled her into his embrace, was Fu Bainian’s mood the same as how she felt a moment ago? </em></p>
 <p><em>In fact, they could’ve had a happy ending. Why would Fu Bainian make such a scene?</em></p>
 <p>Fu Changning had said that he wanted to make her jealous and wanted her to know how important he was to her. <em>If it was really like Fu Changning had said, then she already understood it by now, so why would Fu Bainian continue acting this way? There was no reason for that, unless...he’d really fallen for that woman.</em></p>
 <p>Their marriage was already in such a state; was there really still a need to grasp onto it?</p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao felt as if she’d fallen into a swamp and was trapped there, unable to take another step forward.</p>
 <p><em>Baby, what do you think mummy should do?</em></p>
 <p>But, what could a formless child tell her?</p>
 <p>“Sis-in-law, if you really don’t feel like talking, then have a good rest. I’ll be here for you.”</p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao nodded and closed her eyes.</p>
 <p>Time went by, but she didn’t feel sleepy at all even though she was exhausted.</p>
 <p>It was almost evening when Fu Changning’s phone rang. She took a glimpse at the person who was finally asleep and quickly muted her phone. She then walked out of the room to answer Fu Bainian’s call.</p>
 <p>“Brother, you’re finally willing to answer the phone, and here I thought that you’d disappeared. Just tell me, what’s going on between you and that woman, Yin Yun?! Sis-in-law went to the hotel today to catch you guys, and when she came back, she cried so much that even I can’t stand watching her like this anymore.”</p>
 <p>She said all of this in one go, but Fu Bainian merely responded, “You, take good care of your Sis-in-law.”</p>
 <p>Fu Changning wanted to continue questioning him, but she realised that Fu Bainian had already hung up on her.</p>
 <p>She angrily stomped her foot and roared, “Brother, you scoundrel!”</p>
