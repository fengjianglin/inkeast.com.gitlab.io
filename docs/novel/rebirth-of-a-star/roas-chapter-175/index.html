 <p><b>Chapter 175 - Coping With Bereavement (1)</b></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao sat down on a chair and stared intently at those delicious-looking dishes; her salivary glands were constantly secreting saliva, and she felt hungrier the more she looked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the yacht started sailing, the sky gradually darkened, and she suddenly felt her sight become somewhat blurry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Cheng must know that she was sitting outside because after he’d boarded the yacht, he hadn’t made an appearance yet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, just as Lan Jinyao had extended her hand towards one of the dishes, she suddenly heard Jiang Cheng’s voice behind her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry and just eat. These were specifically prepared for you; there’s no poison in them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Though, as soon as his words fell, Lan Jinyao retracted her hand and cautiously stared at him. However, he just smiled at her before walking over and sitting down beside her. “Why aren’t you eating? You must be starving by now, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go ahead and eat. These are all your favourite dishes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Lan Jinyao remained motionless and glared at him before coldly asking, “What exactly are you scheming now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Cheng heaved a long sigh and feigned a sad expression as he answered, “Meimei, why aren’t you willing to believe in me? Didn’t you want to get off the island? In that case, I’ll take you back, lest you keep torturing yourself. Even if you’re hard-hearted towards yourself, I can’t bear to see you like this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As expected, Jiang Cheng had already found her long ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re the one who left me that apple and bottle of mineral water, aren’t you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Cheng nodded in response. “That’s right! You looked pale and hungry, so I brought you some food. However, I couldn’t let you see me, so I quietly threw them over to your side. Fortunately, I have good control over my strength and didn’t hit you, or else my heart would’ve ached.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He’d extended his hand to touch Lan Jinyao’s face, but she’d moved her face away, leaving his hand hanging in the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then, why didn’t I see you?” At that time, when she’d gotten ahold of the apple and noticed that something wasn’t quite right, she’d instantly checked every nook and cranny. It was impossible for her to have missed anything. So, there was absolutely no way that Jiang Cheng could have hidden his presence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as her words fell, Jiang Cheng revealed a profound smile on his face and said, “Could it be that you’ve become stupid after starving yourself? Don’t forget; this island is mine. As long as I want to, I can hide anywhere, anytime, and no one would be able to find me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon hearing this, Lan Jinyao froze. Could it be that there were secret passages on this island?</span></p>
 <p><span style>As if he’d read her current thoughts, Jiang Cheng’s smile suddenly brightened. “Okay, stop thinking about the details; you won’t be able to figure it out anyway. Now that you’re off the island, just behave and enjoy your meal. After you’re done, I’ll bring you home!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Lan Jinyao heard the words ‘I’ll send you home’, the look in her eyes changed from vigilance to astonishment. She then asked, “You’re taking me home?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He’d be so generous? After having kidnapped her with great difficulty, he was willing to send her home so easily?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry up and eat!” Jiang Cheng stuffed a dessert in her mouth before adding, “Of course, I’ll take you home; stop staring at me like that. In fact, after spending time with you these days, I’ve already thought things through. In this world, there’s no such thing as one who can’t live without the other; the earth will still turn, the sun will still rise, and life will continue...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao ate the cake and quietly listened to Jiang Cheng talk about his inner thoughts and struggles these past few days. Meanwhile, her guard against him also lowered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Cheng glanced at her, and his lips slightly curled up into a shallow smile as he went on and said, “Now that I think about it, without you I can still live on. And, about what you’ve asked me before regarding whether the person I loved was the former Chen Meimei or the current you, I’ve already figured out the answer. In fact, I was very contradictory at first, because obviously, you two are two different people with different personalities. Afterwards, I finally realised that what I liked wasn’t either of you, but the kind of feeling you both gave me…the feeling of being cared for. At that time, Chen Meimei was notorious and many people scolded her, but she wasn’t stingy and showed concern for a trivial fan like me. And, you…even though I’d kidnapped you and wanted us to die together, you left a message for me on my Weibo. I did something awful like that, yet you still hoped for me to go to heaven.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So, now that I’ve thought things through, I’ve decided to let you go to find your own happiness.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao didn’t say anything and just stared at him. If it weren’t for the current state of affairs, she reckoned that she’d be moved to tears by now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Jiang Cheng finished talking, he sighed again and said, “Quickly eat your fill first. Otherwise, I’m afraid that when I send you back later, Fu Bainian won’t let me off. There’s a room in the yacht, so you should go take a good rest when you’re done here. Your current appearance is truly…unsightly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon hearing this, Lan Jinyao subconsciously touched her face, but she didn’t get angry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Lan Jinyao felt a gush a relief. After all, it wasn’t easy for a paranoid person to figure things out so easily. It was good that he’d managed to do so, and that he was willing to send her home. She patted him on the shoulder and said, “It’s good that you’ve figured things out. I was actually afraid that you’d get into a blind alley. In fact, everyone is like a semicircle; once they find their other half, they’ll be able to live the rest of their life in happiness.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Cheng just smiled and asked in return, “That is to say, Fu Bainian is your semicircle?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Without a second thought, Lan Jinyao instantly replied, “Of course.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Following this, she said no more and started eating heartily; she was truly famished this time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sky had already darkened by the time she’d finished eating. Lan Jinyao then walked towards the inner part of the yacht and saw a lot of luxurious-looking rooms. After looking around, she faced Jiang Cheng and said, “I’ll have a rest first. Make sure to wake me up when we arrive.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Cheng nodded at her in response.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was so tired that she fell asleep as soon as she lay in bed. Her breathing gradually levelled, and she entered dreamland.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, before entering dreamland, she’d locked the door as soon as she’d entered the room. It wasn’t that she didn’t believe in Jiang Cheng. Instead, she couldn’t help but guard against others. If Jiang Cheng had indeed figured things out, then that’d be for the best.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During her sleep, Lan Jinyao suddenly felt wobbly and furrowed her eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She abruptly opened her eyes and panted, tightly clutching at the sheets underneath her. There was a sharp pain in her lower abdomen, and her face instantly paled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jiang Cheng! Jiang Cheng, please save me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao shouted Jiang Cheng’s name twice and soon after; she heard someone knocking on the door. She got out of bed with great difficulty and then went to open the door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Cheng nervously asked, “What’s wrong?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao was truly in too much pain; beads of sweat were continuously forming on her forehead. If she were a bit more rational at this moment, she’d have seen the malice hidden behind Jiang Cheng’s flawless expression.</span></p>
