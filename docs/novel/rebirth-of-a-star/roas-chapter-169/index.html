 <p><b>Chapter 169 - Kidnapped Again (6)</b></p>
 <p><span style>The last scene was about Chun Xiang and the explorer’s encounter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The white-haired Chun Xiang could no longer see the beauty of this world. She wore a pair of presbyopia glasses and sat in front of her house mending broken fishing nets. Her chapped hands quivered, so the sharp silver needles often pierced her hands as she stitched. Even so, she didn’t stop mending.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And, it was at this time that the explorer, who resembled Chun Xiang’s lover, arrived on a cruise ship. He looked exactly like his father’s young self; extremely handsome and vigorous. Chun Xiang, on the other hand, had aged and become white-haired. She was already nearing the end of her time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Auntie, is there anyone else on this island?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chun Xiang looked up at him and answered with a hoarse voice, “No, there’s no one else.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In fact, she was the only one left on the island. Those young’uns had left to pursue their dreams, while the elders had already left this world. So, only Chun Xiang remained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Chun Xiang raised her head and stared at the young man in front of her, she instantly froze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh...Ye Lin, you’re back!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The explorer was stunned when he heard that name.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Under the camera lens, Lan Jinyao looked as if she’d aged a lot; her hair had turned white, and her hands were trembling. There were wrinkles all over her face, and her eyes looked muddy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fu Bainian stared at the camera in a trance. At this moment, he seemed to have witnessed an actress with innate talent using her acting skills to prove herself to everyone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He suddenly recalled a saying that he’d heard before. </span><i><span style>Older actors could act adolescent roles well because experience taught them how to act. Young actors, on the other hand, couldn’t always act elderly roles well, because they hadn’t experienced old age yet. With no experience, their performance wouldn’t turn out well.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, Lan Jinyao was different. Through the camera lens, who could tell that she was, in actual fact, a very young actress? In her eyes, one could see seniority and exhaustion, as well as persistence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the explorer faced Chun Xiang and said the two words ‘I’m sorry’, the latter slowly closed her eyes. In that instant, everyone present subconsciously held in their breath and watched her performance. This scene didn’t seem like an act at all; it felt real.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon seeing this scene unfold, Fu Bainian suddenly clenched his hands into fists. She was a born actress; she belonged on-screen for the audience. Yet, he had to selfishly keep her by his side to bear his children.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His heart suddenly felt heavy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, someone approached him from behind, but Fu Bainian didn’t turn around because he already knew who was standing behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Look, she’s a born actress, but you selfishly imprisoned her and kept her by your side. If it were me, I’d let her have her freedom and fly as high as she wants. If this was what she wanted, I’d support her unconditionally. Fu Bainian, I’m fundamentally different from you, even though we both love her dearly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon hearing this, Fu Bainian clenched his hands into fists.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’re indeed different because...she doesn’t love you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The next second, Jiang Cheng’s expression sank.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fu Bainian didn’t turn around. Instead, his gaze landed on the person sitting by the sea, and the corners of his lips slightly raised.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Yes, no matter how outstanding Jiang Cheng was, he couldn’t compare to him because the person Lan Jinyao loved was him, not that man.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Today’s scene was nearing its end, so they could wrap up soon and return home.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the afternoon, Fu Bainian was packing back in the room when Lan Jinyao suddenly came in and asked, “What are you doing? Aren’t we staying one more night? There’s still the wrap-up party tonight. Don’t you want to attend?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, let’s just go back!” he dully said and continued packing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao sat down in the chair next to him and stared at him eagerly. “You’re this movie’s biggest investor. It won’t look good if you don’t attend, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fu Bainian also sat down and stared at her intensely as he asked, “What’s wrong with that? I don’t want to stay at this hateful place any longer. Everyone’s eyeing you covetously, and…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And what?” asked Lan Jinyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He shook his head and remained silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While staying here, there’d been a constant feeling of restlessness in his heart, which had gradually increased as time passed. He felt that his behaviour was becoming all the more abnormal with each passing minute.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao looked at the sky outside and tried to persuade him to stay. “Look, it’s getting late and the weather forecast says that it’s going to rain tonight. Let’s wait until early tomorrow morning to leave, alright? It’s our last day anyway. Pretty please?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fu Bainian firmly shook his head. “No, we’re leaving tonight! Besides, a ship happens to be going back tonight.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Lan Jinyao saw that she was unable to persuade him, she compromised and said, “Okay, fine. Let’s go back tonight.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fu Bainian seemed unwilling to stay here for another second. As soon as Lan Jinyao had agreed to leave tonight, he immediately started to pack up the rest of their belongings. His movements were swift. Seeing this, Lan Jinyao, who was sitting beside him, couldn’t help but laugh. “Why do I feel like you’re in a hurry? Could it be that you’re sensing a bad premonition?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon hearing this, Fu Bainian paused and said, “No, I‘m not!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao nodded and then, after a while, she said, “In fact, I do have a premonition, and it’s a very bad one at that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My heart is filled with uneasiness; as if something is about to happen. Especially tonight, as that feeling has gotten more intense.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So, that was why she’d insisted on staying.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry, it’ll only take us half an hour to get home.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao leaned against Fu Bainian’s chest and listened to his steady heartbeat, which helped to gradually reassure her. She looked out the window at the hazy sky. She reckoned that by the time they boarded the ship, the sky would’ve darkened already and heavy rain would start to pour. The weather forecast had stated that there would be a rainstorm tonight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, there shouldn’t be any problems once they boarded the ship.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unfortunately, contrary to what Lan Jinyao had expected, the game had only begun when she boarded the ship.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At seven in the evening, she stood on the deck, looking at the distant sky. It was dark, and rain could start pouring down any time soon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The waiter brought over a glass of wine and said, “Mr Fu asked me to bring this over to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao didn’t doubt him. However, the moment she picked up the red wine from the tray, she suddenly recalled that she hadn’t touched alcohol for a long time because she was pregnant. </span><i><span style>Fu Bainian was also aware of this, so why would he give her a glass of wine?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, when she noticed that something was wrong, the waiter was already revealing a sinister smile. And, before Lan Jinyao could react, she’d already lost consciousness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Late in the night, amidst the icy seawater, she felt her body turn cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She tried to swim upwards, but a pair of hands grabbed her and dragged her deeper underwater.</span></p>
