 <p><strong>Chapter 107 - A Different Fu Bainian (1)</strong></p>
 <p>Although Jiang Cheng had let the Director change the scene for the last ad, Lan Jinyao still didn’t go to the shoot. She learned later that Fu Bainian was the one who’d declined it. Fu Bainian had even told Li Qi not to tell her that they’d switched the shooting location.</p>
 <p>When Li Qi told Lan Jinyao about this, she asked him, “Does this count as you betraying President Fu?”</p>
 <p>Li Qi hurriedly shook his head and said, “I just wanted to inform you and nothing else. I feel that Jiang Cheng doesn’t hold any ill intentions towards you. In that kind of circumstance, even if there were no Jiang Cheng, I’d have done the same. You must know that at that time, you looked as if you were about to collapse. That scene was truly scary.”</p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao smiled. “I believe in my intuition! Since Fu Bainian declined the ad for me, then let’s just forget about it!”</p>
 <p>Even if the last ad wasn’t completed, the shampoo ad series was still broadcasted on all the major TV stations. Moreover, on the shampoo website, there was a paragraph explaining: <em>The unfinished story will be shown to all consumers with our future achievements. We hope that everyone will continue supporting us.</em></p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao inadvertently visited the official website and saw that explanation. At first glance, this approach was quite creative. Hence, she reckoned that other advertising agencies would also follow suit and imitate this idea!</p>
 <p>In the afternoon, Fu Changning called and told them to go home for dinner. Typically, this kind of dinner invitation call was done by her Mother-in-law. However, since Fu Changning had learned that she was Lan Jinyao, she’d put away her thorns and had opened up to her.</p>
 <p>In fact, Fu Changning also owned her own place, but she didn’t stay there that much and would occasionally visit Fu Bainian and stay at his place for a few days. But, after she’d learnt of Lan Jinyao’s identity, she began to live at home more often.</p>
 <p>These were things that Fu Bainian had told Lan Jinyao later on.</p>
 <p>Following that, Lan Jinyao first finished a photoshoot at the studio, and then took the elevator to go to Fu Bainian’s office to find him. At the same time, Qian Ran was holding onto a pile of documents and was preparing to go there as well, but several folders on top had fallen off the pile on his way.</p>
 <p>“Let me help you!” Lan Jinyao bent down to help Qian Ran pick up the files.</p>
 <p>The words ‘River Group Corporation’ printed on those documents caught her eyes. But, as she was about to open them to take a closer look, her movements suddenly paused and she hesitated for a moment before she gave the documents back to Qian Ran.</p>
 <p>“Is Bainian currently very busy?”</p>
 <p>“President Fu might be a bit busier these days as the company has a lot of things that need to be dealt with by him personally.”</p>
 <p>“Oh!” Lan Jinyao nodded, but a lot of question marks popped up in her mind. <em>Could it really be like what Xu Jin’ge had said? That Fu Bainian was planning to expand his business overseas?</em></p>
 <p>When she thought up to this point, she stopped Qian Ran again and asked, “Does the company plan to train a new batch of newcomers soon?”</p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao noticed that when she’d asked this question, the smile on Qian Ran’s face had seemingly turned unnatural and he replied, “Haha, yes, so President Fu will be a bit busier these days because of this. By the way, are you looking for President Fu?”</p>
 <p>“That’s right! Let’s go in together!”</p>
 <p>And, right then, Fu Bainian heard the noise outside and shouted, “Qian Ran, come in!”</p>
 <p>“What are you dawdling about for…?”</p>
 <p>As he was speaking, Fu Bainian saw Lan Jinyao following Qian Ran. It dawned on him that Qian Ran must’ve been standing outside talking to Lan Jinyao, so he hadn’t come in earlier.</p>
 <p>“You can leave the documents here and go back,” declared Fu Bainian.</p>
 <p>Qian Ran glanced at him and then strode out. Their meaningful exchange didn’t escape Lan Jinyao’s eyes.</p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao sat down on the sofa and said to Fu Bainian, “Changning called earlier and told me that Mum is urging us to go home for dinner tonight. I immediately came over after finishing the photoshoot.”</p>
 <p>Fu Bainian set the documents aside and sat next to her on the sofa before asking, “Say, you’re doing so much here and there; filming a new drama on one side, and then promoting it next. Don’t you feel tired?”</p>
 <p>As he was speaking, he tugged the hair lingering on her forehead away to the back; his movements were gentle and natural.</p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao quickly shook her head when she heard this.</p>
 <p>The current workload was twice as much as before, but she didn’t feel tired at all. Shen Wei’an was still alive and well, so she couldn’t let go yet. Besides, whenever she saw anything related to Shen Wei’an on the news, she would feel recharged and would be brimming with fighting spirit.</p>
 <p>But, apparently, that wasn’t the answer that Fu Bainian had wanted to hear. He paused for a moment and then said to her, “If you feel tired, I can ask Li Qi to offload some unnecessary promotional activities for you. You just need to focus on filming the new drama with ease and nothing else…”</p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao had already guessed what he wanted to say, so she quickly interrupted him. “It’s fine; I’m really not tired. At this moment, there are truly too many things waiting for me to do, but you don’t have to worry about me.”</p>
 <p>Fu Bainian was clearly unhappy with her response as his lips were tightly pressed together and he didn’t look at her.</p>
 <p>After a few moments of silence, Lan Jinyao compromised and added, “If I feel tired, I’ll let you know, alright? But, if there’s something weighing on your mind, I hope that you’ll tell me too.”</p>
 <p>She couldn’t understand why Fu Bainian wanted to investigate everything about River Group Corporation. River Group Corporation and Blue Hall Entertainment were competitors in the entertainment industry, so it was implausible for them to have any business dealings. If Fu Bainian really wanted to take a shot at River Group Corporation, then in her opinion that would only bring more loss to his company, and there was nothing to gain from it.</p>
 <p>Jiang Family’s properties were no less than those in Fu Bainian’s hands, so Lan Jinyao was worried that Fu Bainian would lose his rationality and do something regretful. She knew just how dangerous that man was.</p>
 <p>Fu Bainian only nodded after a long while and said, “I will. I promise you!”</p>
 <p>When evening arrived, the two returned to the Fu Residence. Fu Changning was sitting on the sofa when they walked in, so she immediately got up and greeted them.</p>
 <p>“Sister-in-law, could you please sign here for me? I have a colleague who’s a huge fan of yours!”</p>
 <p>Fu Changning had already started her internship at an accountancy firm.</p>
 <p>Fu Changning was holding onto a tiny diary. As soon as she handed it over, Fu Bainian snatched it from her and asked with a deep voice, “Did you mention those matters to your colleagues?”</p>
 <p>“No, I haven’t!” Fu Changning pursed her lips, extremely dissatisfied with Fu Bainian’s tone of voice. She then added, “How could I tell others? I haven’t even told our parents!”</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Fu Guosheng heard this and asked, “What’s all this about? What haven’t you told us yet?”</p>
 <p>Fu Changning glared at Fu Bainian before she marched to Fu Guosheng’s side with a smile on her face.</p>
 <p>Seeing this, Lan Jinyao then quickly said, “You may have misunderstood Changning!”</p>
 <p><em>The person who Fu Changning’s colleague liked could very well be the current Chen Meimei.</em></p>
 <p>Fu Bainian nodded in response, but his complexion still didn’t look very good. He then walked upstairs, and Lan Jinyao was left staring at his back, feeling baffled.</p>
 <p><em>Why was he so moody? This wasn’t a big issue, right?</em></p>
