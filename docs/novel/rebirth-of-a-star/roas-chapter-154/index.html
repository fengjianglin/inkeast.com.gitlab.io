 <p><b>Chapter 154 - Who Killed Her (3)</b></p>
 <p><span style>“What makes you think that I killed Shen Wei’an?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Xin laughed until she cried, and used a napkin to wipe the corner of her eyes. She then looked at Lan Jinyao and added, “What were you thinking? I don’t like Shen Wei’an, but why would I dirty my hands for her? I’m a good citizen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon seeing her reaction, Lan Jinyao was relatively certain that Lan Xin wasn’t lying to her at this moment. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could it be that she was mistaken? Maybe Shen Wei’an had made too many enemies, or she’d offended someone, and that person couldn’t stand her, thus causing them to take this opportunity to get rid of her.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m really sorry about this. I’d previously seen Shen Wei’an’s details in your backpack and knew that you were investigating her, so that’s why I made this speculation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Xin poked Lan Jinyao’s forehead as soon as she heard this. “I really regard you as a friend, so, next time, you’re not allowed to judge me before you get to the bottom of things.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Lan Xin’s fingertips touched her forehead, Lan Jinyao was left in a trance for a moment. This action was very familiar, but after searching through all her past memories, she couldn’t find any traces of anyone doing this to her in the past.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She stared at Lan Xin’s face, and a strange feeling suddenly welled up in her heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Something flashed through her mind, but it was so fast that she couldn’t grasp it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If it wasn’t you, then who could it be?” murmured Lan Jinyao, somewhat puzzled.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>If it wasn’t Lan Xin, then who else in this world would deliberately want Shen Wei’an dead?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>This matter had now become questionable. Lan Jinyao had initially thought that she’d found out the truth behind this, but after seeing Lan Xin today, she’d realised that things were not as simple as she’d first speculated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Looks like you asked me out today solely for this matter. It seems that you do care about me, but I don’t think you need to worry about this. As you sow, so shall you reap; the Heavens wanted to take her away, so who could prevent that? Just let the cops investigate! You'll eventually know when the truth comes out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao nodded, but she still felt somewhat disconcerted. She suddenly felt less certain about whether the person who’d died was Shen Wei’an.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Lan Jinyao arrived home in the afternoon, she saw two people in uniform asking something at the security booth near the gates of the residential area. When she drew nearer, she noticed that those people were police officers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, a saying suddenly flashed in Lan Jinyao’s mind: </span><i><span style>plant stolen goods on someone and place the blame on her.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, she’d stayed at home these past few days. Besides Fu Bainian, Fu Changning was the only person who’d accompanied her and, sometimes, she’d take a stroll around the park, nothing more. If someone had really fabricated a charge against her, then that person’s scheme was way too hilarious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The security guards on duty saw her and pointed in her direction while saying something to the policemen, causing the policemen to then walk towards her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ms Chen, we are police officers from the Major Crime Unit. A homicide has occurred within the city, and we are here to investigate some details today.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, please follow me and we can discuss further at my place!” Lan Jinyao was extremely cooperative.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as they entered the house, Lan Jinyao felt a surge of nausea, so she quickly rushed to the bathroom, leaving the two police officers behind at the door to stare at each other in dismay.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Lan Jinyao came out, a few minutes had already passed. Her face still looked a bit flushed, and she smiled apologetically at the police officers as she said, “I’m sorry about that, but please come in and sit down!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>One of the police officers then asked, “Ms Chen, you’re...pregnant?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right, so I’ve been resting at home these days, and I’ve also stopped taking on new projects. From now on, I’m just going to stay at home and focus on raising my baby, so I don’t plan to continue working for the time being.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Lan Jinyao finished saying this, the two police officers standing in front of her looked at each other with a look that read ‘how could a pregnant woman have that capability?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, she knew what they were thinking, but she had nothing to fear; as the saying goes ‘an upright person is not afraid of gossip’.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Officers, I wonder what you’d like to ask?” questioned Lan Jinyao with a flawless smile plastered on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, it’s like this. We received a report a few days ago that someone had found a corpse in the western suburbs. After our preliminary investigation, the deceased turned out to be the actress, Shen Wei’an. Before the victim went missing, she’d shot a TV series on location, and from our findings, we learnt that you two had some conflicts back then.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao inwardly sneered when she heard this. </span><i><span style>In fact, the conflicts between her and Shen Wei’an were much more than that.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, at the time I was filming a fighting scene, and Shen Wei’an secretly threw stones at me, affecting Xu Hao’s performance, who was acting as the male lead. Xu Hao’s sword was supposed to be a prop prepared by the crew. However, the prop was replaced with a real sword, and I was injured at the time; I even went to the hospital afterwards.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If that’s the case, then Shen Wei’an would’ve been convicted of intended homicide. Did you report her to the police back then?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao thought about it before answering, “At that time, I had gotten hold of the evidence and wanted to report her to the police. However, Shen Wei’an fled before I could do so, and even the crew didn’t know where she went. Another actress was switched in for her role last minute, to finish filming the last part of the drama.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She ran away at that time? Then, how did she die in the western suburbs?” asked the police officer in a low muffled voice, seemingly questioning Lan Jinyao while also talking to himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If I may ask, do you still have anything else to ask me about? I haven’t been feeling well lately, so I need to sleep more often.” When Lan Jinyao said this, she looked at them with a slightly apologetic smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The police officers stood up and said, “We’ve already finished asking all our questions. If there is any progress in the case, we may need your cooperation again when the time comes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao also stood up and hurriedly said, “If needed, I’ll certainly cooperate with your investigation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Lan Jinyao sent the police officers off, she closed the door and leaned against it, listening to the movements outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Her morning sickness looks very severe, so it shouldn’t be possible for her to kill and dump the body.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Besides, from our findings, it could be seen that she clearly had an alibi. Looks like we still need to carry on with our investigation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s it for now, let’s go back first!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After their voices gradually trailed off, Lan Jinyao returned to her bedroom. She was quite tired, so she lay down to rest for a bit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao, who was lying in bed with her eyes closed, couldn’t fall asleep even after a long time had passed. Her thoughts wandered and played back the scene of the day that they’d gone to check on Shen Wei’an’s body in the morgue. She was lying there motionless, her appearance extremely frightening. Lan Jinyao then recalled the moment of her own death; her appearance then must’ve been worse than Shen Wei’an’s!</span></p>
