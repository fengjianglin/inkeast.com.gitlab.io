 <p>When Fu Bainian arrived at the parking lot he received a text message from Qian Ran with Lan Xin’s address.</p> 
 <p>Generally speaking, artists officially signed under the banner of Blue Hall Entertainment wouldn’t live outside. The company would normally arrange the accommodation for its artists because on one hand, it was more convenient to manage them, and on the other, it was to avoid them being followed by the paparazzi and getting involved in scandals. But, Lan Xin was obviously an exception.</p> 
 <p>Lan Xin was on good terms with Lan Jinyao, and she had the same face as the former Lan Jinyao. As such, on the account of Fu Bainian, Shen Yu didn’t object to Lan Xin arranging her own accommodation. Even though she was living outside, the company still had a record of her address.</p> 
 <p>Fu Bainian soon arrived at Lan Xin’s place.</p> 
 <p>She was currently living in a small villa located outside the city centre. The place itself shouldn’t be that expensive, but looking at the decorations outside, it seemed to have cost a lot of money.</p> 
 <p>Fu Bainian rang the doorbell outside the yard, but no one came to open the door.</p> 
 <p>After a while, he looked around but there was no one on the road. He took off his suit jacket and tossed it in the car before climbing up the wall and jumping over it, landing in the yard.</p> 
 <p>He then proceeded to the main entrance and knocked on the door.</p> 
 <p>“Lan Xin, are you home?”</p> 
 <p>It was already late autumn, but it was still a scorching hot day. Small beads of sweat were visible on Fu Bainian’s forehead as he knocked on the hot iron door. After knocking for a while, the hollow of his palm had turned red.</p> 
 <p>Seeing that there was no response, he fished out his mobile and made a call to Lan Xin. However, it was the same as when he was in the car; the call connected but no one answered it.</p> 
 <p>After hanging up, he kicked the door ferociously before turning and leaving.</p> 
 <p>Just then, movement could be heard coming from inside, but it was so faint that Fu Bainian didn't hear it. He left Lan Xin’s house and went back to the company.</p> 
 <p>After Fu Bainian had left, the door slowly opened, and Lan Xin appeared wearing a nightgown. As she stared at the road outside the yard, the corners of her lips gradually curled upwards.</p> 
 <p>“Lan Jinyao, I’m really sorry. How would I know that you would take the elevator to the rooftop at that time? I’d initially thought that the scapegoat would be someone else! Although I really like you, the feud between Shen Wei’an and I must come to an end. I don’t want to be caught, so I can only wrong you and let you take the blame for me.”</p> 
 <p>Lan Xin looked up at the clear blue sky; her gaze containing hints of sadness as she murmured the two words ‘I’m sorry’ over and over again…</p> 
 <p>…</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, in the interrogation room, a police officer was in the middle of questioning Lan Jinyao. At the beginning, whatever the police officer asked, Lan Jinyao truthfully answered, but then the questioning ended up in a stalemate.</p> 
 <p>This happened when he questioned Lan Jinyao about her motive for murder.</p> 
 <p>“Why did you kill her?” after noting down everything that Lan Jinyao had said, the Police Officer sitting opposite Lan Jinyao suddenly asked. </p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao’s lips curled into a sarcastic smile, and she replied, “I’ve already answered this question not too long ago. I didn’t kill anyone. If you don’t believe me, you can investigate. Before I went to the company, I did get in touch with Shen Wei’an, but she was the one who called me and said that she was going to jump, so of course I had to rush there to save her. However, by the time I got to the roof, Shen Wei’an was already nowhere in sight. I didn’t even get to see her corpse!”</p> 
 <p>“If you truly wanted to save Shen Wei’an, then why did you take the escape route?” asked the Police Officer forcefully.</p> 
 <p>Even though he was staring at Lan Jinyao, the latter wasn’t one bit afraid, and she looked him straight in the eyes.</p> 
 <p>“At that time, I’d initially wanted to go see my husband, but then I thought, if my husband also went there, things might get out of hand. So, I decided to go to the rooftop by myself. However, right then one of the elevators was descending and the other one was ascending, so I had no choice but to take the stairs!”</p> 
 <p>Luckily, Lan Jinyao was very quick-witted. <em>In fact, she didn’t take the escape route to go save Shen Wei’an, but she wanted to rush there to send her off! But, how could she possibly tell the Police Officer this? If she were to show the slightest motive for murder, she might be forced to confess under torture.</em></p> 
 <p>“Is that so?” The Police Officer nodded; he’d seemingly bought her story.</p> 
 <p>“You just said that one of the elevators were descending, and that one of them were ascending. Did you notice which floor the elevator ascended to?”</p> 
 <p>When she heard the Police Officer ask this, Lan Jinyao’s eyes widened and she suddenly remembered that Lan Xin had taken the same elevator as her. <em>Now that she thought about it, Lan Xin was quite suspicious as well…!</em></p> 
 <p><em>I’m just here for my Manager!</em></p> 
 <p><em>Lan Xin’s Manager’s office was a floor below, and at that time, her mind was too occupied and she didn’t pay attention to this small detail. However, now that she thought about it, there were many loopholes. What if Lan Xin had gone to the rooftop at that time? If so, did she arrive there before her and push Shen Wei’an?</em></p> 
 <p><em>What kind of feud was there between Lan Xin and Shen Wei’an? Why did Lan Xin want to kill Shen Wei’an so badly?</em></p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao frowned and carefully recalled the little details of the days she’d spent with Lan Xin. However, the more she thought about it, the more confused she became.</p> 
 <p>Seeing her deep in thought, the Police Officer impatiently coughed twice, breaking her trance.</p> 
 <p>“Do you know who went up there?”</p> 
 <p>After hesitating for a while, Lan Jinyao balled her hands into fists, took a deep breath, and said, “The person who went up was a female artist from our company. I assume that she went all the way to the top floor. Police Officer, you can start investigating in this direction!”</p> 
 <p><em>They were friends, so she shouldn’t have exposed Lan Xin’s actions in front of the police officer, but if Lan Xin was really the one behind this incident, then how could Lan Xin have the heart to push the blame on her and let her be the scapegoat?</em></p> 
 <p>The Police Officer nodded. “Our team will certainly investigate this.”</p> 
 <p>Following this, the Police Officer left, leaving Lan Jinyao behind in the quiet room. She couldn’t help but frown as she recalled everything that had happened today.</p> 
 <p><em>Shen Wei’an was her friend, yet she’d accused her of blocking her path. Lan Xin was also her friend, yet she’d made her her scapegoat…</em></p> 
 <p><em>Could it be that she wasn’t destined to have any friends in this lifetime?</em> </p> 
 <p>Then, Lan Jinyao’s eyes suddenly lit up when she remembered something. <em>Earlier, she’d told Lan Xin that she was going to Fu Bainian’s office, and not the rooftop. So, if Lan Xin was really the one behind this incident, then Lan Xin mightn’t have wanted to frame her exactly; she’d just wanted to find a random person to be her scapegoat…</em></p>

 <p>Hi all, please enjoy the chapter ^^</p>
 <p>P.S. As some of you may know already, my sister came to visit me, so I didn't publish anything in the week of 20th May. And I tried to at least publish something last week, so it had been a really hectic week for me as I had to go to work, attend my friend's wedding as a bridesmaid, spend time with my sister, and translate ROAS at the same time, which wasn't really manageable... I only managed to do one chapter today, so no double chapters today unfortunately &gt;.&lt;&nbsp;</p>
 <p>My sister will be here until 12th of June and then fly back home, so I would like to spend the rest of the coming days with her. I'm really sorry but there would be no new chapters in the meantime. I will certainly be back after that with more chapters.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Your patience and understanding will be greatly appreciated!</p>
