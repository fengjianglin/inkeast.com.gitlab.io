 <p><strong>Chapter 117 - Quarreling For The First Time (7)</strong></p>
 <p>Li Qi had been anxiously listening to the couple quarreling, but he didn’t expect that someone would come to join in the chaos and create more trouble at this time. The moment he saw the person walking out of the elevator, his entire body froze.</p>
 <p>No more than ten seconds later, a man in a casual business suit was already standing before him.</p>
 <p>“P-President Jiang! Are you coming to look for our President Fu? It may not be convenient at the moment.”</p>
 <p>His voice was stuttering as things couldn’t get any worse. When Shen Yu came out of the office, he should’ve quickly left with him rather than waiting and standing guard outside.</p>
 <p>“I’m coming to look for your President Fu. I also know what’s going on in the office at this moment.”</p>
 <p>The corner of the man’s mouth raised slightly, forming a smug smile.</p>
 <p>“Listen, they’ve started to quarrel.” Jiang Cheng lowered his voice and said to him, “Do you know what the biggest weakness of your President Fu is? It’s his self-righteous affection; he loves Chen Meimei too deeply. However, this love will ruin them both.”</p>
 <p>At this moment, thoughts were running rampant in Li Qi’s mind. <em>No wonder this man has become a rival that President Fu cares about. It turns out that he was the person who knew President Fu the best.</em></p>
 <p>“Now, please let me in!”</p>
 <p>Li Qi shook his head and spread out his arms to prevent Jiang Cheng from entering.</p>
 <p>Jiang Cheng showed a sneer at the corner of his mouth. He said, “You can’t stop me.”</p>
 <p>Li Qi was really unable to stop him as with just a light push from Jiang Cheng, his small body swayed to the side. Jiang Cheng immediately pushed the door open and entered without even knocking on the door.</p>
 <p>“What are you two quarreling about?”</p>
 <p>The loud voice of a man rang in the office. At that moment, Fu Bainian, who was sitting on the office chair, abruptly stood up and stared coldly at Jiang Cheng who was standing at the doorway. Meanwhile, Lan Jinyao was startled by Fu Bainian’s sudden movement.</p>
 <p>With a smile plastered on his face, Jiang Cheng slowly walked to Lan Jinyao’s side and looked at the pair.</p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao became nervous due to his sudden appearance.</p>
 <p>“What are you doing here?” she asked in an unfriendly tone.</p>
 <p>Jiang Cheng seemed to ignore her attitude. Maybe it was because his mood was jovial, so even if Lan Jinyao talked to him in this tone, he still looked at Fu Bainian with a smile. He didn’t appear angry at all.</p>
 <p>“I’m here to look for you, of course. We talked about it letting you play the female lead role before, so I didn’t expect for our plans to suddenly change. When I received the call this morning, I immediately rushed here, and then I realised that it was President Fu who refused to let you go.”</p>
 <p>As he was saying this, Jiang Cheng’s eyes stared straight at Fu Bainian, ridicule gleaming in his eyes.</p>
 <p>“President Fu, are you worried that after your artist cooperated with my company, she would be like Shen Wei’an and switch over to our company? It seems that President Fu doesn't believe in the artists in his company,” he chuckled, not showing the slightest trace of hostility.</p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao and Fu Bainian simultaneously clenched their fists.</p>
 <p>Jiang Cheng was indeed a master negotiator. He’d managed to use a simple word or two to easily provoke someone's mood. When Lan Jinyao heard Shen Wei'an’s name, her decision to play it the role was strengthened. While for Fu Bainian, when he heard the words ‘switch over to our company’ and ‘President Fu doesn't believe in the artists in his company’, his blood seemed to be frozen by a deep chill.</p>
 <p>Not long ago, Lan Jinyao was still accusing him: <em>Fu Bainian, you don’t believe in me, right?</em></p>
 <p>That sentence was the most profound fear hidden within his heart.</p>
 <p>“Jiang Cheng, don’t interfere with things between Meimei and me. As for business matters, I refuse to change my mind.”</p>
 <p>Jiang Cheng chuckled. “Of course, this will be done according to President Fu’s command. Now, I just want to ask, will you let Meimei go to my company for an audition or not? Everyone is waiting for her; even Shen Wei’an is coming!”</p>
 <p>“Going!”</p>
 <p>“Not going!”</p>
 <p>The two spoke at the same time. After Fu Bainian and Lan Jinyao finished speaking, their eyes locked with small sparks.</p>
 <p>Shen Wei’an’s name was already like an obstacle in Lan Jinyao’s mind. It couldn’t be overcome unless she finished these matters.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Jiang Cheng was the thorn in Fu Bainian’s heart that he couldn’t free himself of for a lifetime.</p>
 <p>Fu Bainian’s gaze was glued tightly to Lan Jinyao’s face. Then, he said in a deep voice, “Chen Meimei, don’t forget that you’re still an employee under Blue Hall Entertainment.”</p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao became furious when she heard that. She picked up the termination contract on the desk to sign it. However, just as her hand went to grab the pen, it was stopped by Fu Bainian. The man gritted his teeth as he asked her, “Chen Meimei, you dare to sign it?”</p>
 <p>“Why wouldn’t I dare?” Lan Jinyao wasn’t intimidated by Fu Bainian’s menacing gaze. She struggled to raise her hand.</p>
 <p>The next moment, Fu Bainian’s hand was also held in someone’s grip. Then, Lan Jinyao noticed that the veins on his arm were protruding from the force of Jiang Cheng’s grip.</p>
 <p>“President Fu, aren't you going a bit overboard? Since your employee has already made a decision, why are you make things difficult for her? If her heart isn’t with you, what good is it to keep her?”</p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao felt a headache forming. “Jiang Cheng, please don’t cause more trouble, alright? We’re currently talking about work matters.”</p>
 <p>Fu Bainian finally released her hand.</p>
 <p>His dark eyes were filled with sorrow.</p>
 <p>“Think carefully, Chen Meimei; do you have the money to pay the penalty fee? You should be clear that Chen Meile won’t help you, and she won’t let the Chen family help you either.”</p>
 <p>At this moment, Lan Jinyao suddenly hesitated. With her anger gradually dissipating, her rational gained the upper hand. She was very clear about what she was doing.</p>
 <p>Right then, Jiang Cheng, who was standing at the side, suddenly opened his mouth. He said to Lan Jinyao, “I can help you pay the penalty fee. Just treat it as remuneration from the TV series, so you don’t have to worry. If you want to sign, just sign it!”</p>
 <p>This sentence seemed to ignite Fu Bainian’s anger. Before Lan Jinyao could react, his fist had landed squarely on Jiang Cheng’s face. A corner of Jiang Cheng’s mouth was cut by Fu Bainian’s fist, and a few drops of blood seeped out.</p>
 <p>“You started it, Fu Bainian!”</p>
 <p>Jiang Cheng wasn't polite at all and immediately retaliated with his fist landing on Fu Bainian’s face. The documents on the desk were then swept to the ground.</p>
 <p>Watching the two men fighting, Lan Jinyao became anxious and rushed to the door. “Li Qi, quickly call the security guard!”</p>
 <p>Ten minutes later, both men were bruised and panting on the floor.</p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao held Fu Bainian’s face, tears continuously rolling down her cheeks as she repeatedly said, “I won’t sign, don’t fight anymore…”</p>
