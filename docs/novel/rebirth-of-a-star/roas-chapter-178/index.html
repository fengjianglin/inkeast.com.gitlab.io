 <p><b>Chapter 178 - A Little More Ruthless (2)</b></p>
 <p><span>The VIP ward was filled with Jiang Cheng’s mad laughter. He closed in on Lan Jinyao’s ear in an intimate manner before whispering in a dangerous tone, “Of course, I wouldn’t dare, because this has nothing to do with me.” </span></p>
 <p><span>Upon hearing this, Lan Jinyao’s eyes widened, and her complexion turned deathly pale as she stared at him in horror.</span></p>
 <p><span>“How could this possibly have nothing to do with you? You want to kill Fu Bainian! You...you’ve had this intention since long ago, right? Fu Bainian injured his arm while he was abroad; that was a gunshot wound, wasn’t it?” her voice trembled as she softly asked. Her fear had reached its pinnacle.</span></p>
 <p><span>Then, suddenly, Jiang Cheng covered her mouth with his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Shhh, keep your voice down. You probably don’t know this yet, but there’s a mercenary group operating outside the borders of this country, and each of them are the best of the batch with extremely outstanding skills. One of them recently escaped and fled to our country. Say, if that mercenary kills someone, it would have nothing to do with an ordinary businessman like me, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Lan Jinyao glared at him and angrily said, “So you’re trying to push the blame on that mercenary in order to get away unscathed and escape punishment?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“You worded it incorrectly. In fact, this matter has nothing to do with me.” Jiang Cheng slightly smiled as he stressed again.</span></p>
 <p><span>“How could this have nothing to do with you?” asked Lan Jinyao with tears streaming down her face. “Jiang Cheng, what on earth do you want? Do you want me to die? My baby’s already gone, and you’re trying to kill my husband now? Why don’t you just simplify things and kill me with one stab instead? I won’t occupy Chen Meimei’s body; I’ll give it back to you...I’ll give it back to you!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Lan Jinyao pulled the quilt up and covered her face as she sobbed.</span></p>
 <p><span>It was a pity that she didn’t have a knife with her. If she did, she would’ve stabbed this man in front of her without even the slightest bit of hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Don’t worry; I won’t end Fu Bainian’s life so easily. I just want you to cooperate with me and put on an act. After the play, I’ll let him leave. In fact, I don’t think Fu Bainian deserves you. He’s too indecisive, and he’s not ruthless enough. If someone was coveting my wife, I’d have shot him in the head ages ago, obliterating him from this world. I wouldn’t give him a chance to get close to my wife.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Lan Jinyao’s voice was raspy and accompanied by sobs as she stammered, “This is why you can never compare with Fu Bainian. Although he’s ruthless in the business world, he’d never act so cruel and ruthless in his personal life. Only a man like him can give someone love and happiness. But, you’re different; your heart is cold and rock-hard, so you can’t give someone love, and you also don’t deserve to be loved by others.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Upon hearing this, the smile on Jiang Cheng’s face instantly disappeared, and there was a sad look in his eyes as he softly said, “That’s right, people like me don’t deserve to be loved, but there’s nothing I can do. It’s impossible to change my way of thinking in this lifetime, so you don’t have to say things that make me unhappy. If I’m not happy, you and Fu Bainian won’t have it easy either.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Jiang Cheng, tell me, what on earth do you want exactly? If you do anything to Fu Bainian, I swear that I’ll kill you even if I have to sacrifice my life.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“I already told you that I merely want us to put on an act and make Fu Bainian give up on you. Afterwards, I’ll let him go.”</span></p>
 <p><span>And, right at this moment, someone knocked on the door. Listening to the steady footsteps, it should be a man. Lan Jinyao abruptly opened her eyes and her gaze landed on the building outside her window.</span></p>
 <p><span>“I’ll agree!” Lan Jinyao suddenly said as her heart leapt into her throat.</span></p>
 <p><span>Upon seeing her reaction, Jiang Cheng smiled and happily said, “Okay, you have to keep your word.”</span></p>
 <p><span>As soon as his voice fell, the door of the ward was pushed open. In that instant, the vice that had been holding Lan Jinyao’s heart loosened a little. The person standing outside wasn’t Fu Bainian, but an unfamiliar guy wearing a black suit and a pair of silver-rimmed glasses. His hair was combed meticulously, and he was carrying a folder in his hand; his appearance was like that of an elite.</span></p>
 <p><span>“President Jiang, I’ve brought the document over; it’s just missing the signatures.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Lan Jinyao stared at him and cautiously asked, “What document?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Jiang Cheng took the folder and smiled at her as he said, “It’s just a normal document. Fu Bainian will arrive soon, so if you don’t want to see him die in front of you, you’d better make him sign this document. Only then will I let him go.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“What‘s on it?”</span></p>
 <p><span>For a moment, Lan Jinyao thought that Jiang Cheng wanted her to be a spy and bring him data of all the property and shares in Fu Bainian’s company. After all, they were competitors in the business world.</span></p>
 <p><span>Jiang Cheng handed her the folder, and the large text reflected in her eyes read: </span><i><span>Divorce Agreement</span></i><span>.</span></p>
 <p><span>Lan Jinyao’s eyes widened, and she asked, “Why do you want Fu Bainian to sign this document? Do you think that you’ll be able to separate us with something like this?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Whether that can be done or not doesn’t lie with me, but you. I’ve always admired your acting skills. Besides, you’ve lived with Fu Bainian all this time, so you know him better than anyone else. I believe that even if you have to act, you’ll be able to fool him.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“I...” her mouth was suddenly covered before she managed to say the word ‘refuse’.</span></p>
 <p><span>Jiang Cheng once more revealed a sinister smile as he interrupted. “Don’t refuse, because you don’t have any choice. Look over there on the rooftop...Fu Bainian will be here soon.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Lan Jinyao tightly tugged at the sheets underneath her and ferociously glared at Jiang Cheng. It seemed that she wanted to tear him apart right then and there.</span></p>
 <p><span>A long time passed, but Jiang Cheng still didn’t get an answer from her.</span></p>
 <p><span>Soon after, Fu Bainian arrived. Just before the door opened, Jiang Cheng held Lan Jinyao’s hand tightly, and his sinister expression faded, leaving only a warm and bright smile in its place.</span></p>
 <p><span>Lan Jinyao honestly didn’t want to look at his smiling expression, so she turned to face the window.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Meimei!” Fu Bainian’s slightly weary voice reverberated around the room.</span></p>
 <p><span>Lan Jinyao was closely staring at the movements on the building opposite theirs. She was wondering: </span><i><span>Was what Jiang Cheng said true or was he just trying to scare her? But, if it was true, then Fu Bainian’s life was in danger.</span></i></p>
 <p><span>Jiang Cheng handed the divorce papers to Fu Bainian, and then his demonic voice echoed in her ear as he said, “Meimei has already aborted your child. We’ll be together in the future.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Fu Bainian stared incredulously at Lan Jinyao and asked, “Meimei? Our child…”</span></p>
 <p><span>Before he finished his sentence, Lan Jinyao softly answered, “Mhmm.”</span></p>
