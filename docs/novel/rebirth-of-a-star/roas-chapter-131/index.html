 <p><strong>Chapter 131 - Despair (4)</strong></p>
 <p>Inside the pitch-black bedroom, Lan Jinyao carried Fu Bainian with great difficulty to the bed. She then pulled the curtains aside and opened the window, letting a cool breeze blow in and carry away the strong smell of alcohol.</p>
 <p>That woman’s words repeatedly echoed in her ears. Her words didn’t contain any malice, but, to a woman, those words were clearly provocative. Which woman in this world would like it when her husband tells all his innermost thoughts to another woman, and not to herself?</p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao despairingly tried to comfort herself. <em>I was just too busy, so Fu Bainian didn’t have a chance to tell me anything.</em></p>
 <p>The moonlight shining through the window left a soft sheen on Fu Bainian’s face; his expression appeared much softer like this. Lan Jinyao extended her hand and gently patted his face. “Fu Bainian, have you fallen asleep?”</p>
 <p>Fu Bainian lightly grunted, but he didn’t open his eyes.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing this, Lan Jinyao shook her head and walked to the bathroom. She brought back a basin of warm water to help him wash up. Lan Jinyao had never done anything like this before, so her movements were somewhat rusty, and Fu Bainian, who was lying on the bed, slightly frowned, seemingly feeling a bit uncomfortable.</p>
 <p>“Fu Bainian...”</p>
 <p>She called him again, but there was still no response. It looked like he’d genuinely KO’d this time.</p>
 <p>Then, Lan Jinyao’s hand that was unbuttoning his shirt abruptly froze when she saw a bright red lipstick print on Fu Bainian’s chest, the rim of her eyes instantly turning red. In general, women were extremely susceptible to lipstick colours, and she, as an actress, would come in contact with different colours all the time. And, at this moment, she noticed that the lipstick print on Fu Bainian’s chest was the same colour as the lipstick worn by the woman who’d taken him home earlier. It was a very sensual bright red.</p>
 <p>That dazzling red in contrast with the silvery-white moonlight gradually manifested into that woman’s face in front of her eyes. Her expression was filled with ridicule; that woman was currently mocking her.</p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao grabbed the towel and rubbed the red tint off with force; so much so that Fu Bainian’s flesh turned red and started to sting. He then awkwardly held out his hand due to the discomfort and waved her hand away before covering his chest. His hand shielded the red stain.</p>
 <p>Witnessing this, Lan Jinyao seemed to have gone mad as she fiercely tossed the towel on Fu Bainian’s chest. Her tears uncontrollably streamed down her face, and a feeling of nausea surged in her heart as she ran towards the bathroom.</p>
 <p>There was an earth-shattering sound of vomiting in the restroom that echoed in the stillness of the night.</p>
 <p>However, her stomach was empty, and she didn’t manage to spit anything out. Contrariwise, her tears continued to stream down like a string of pearls to the floor.</p>
 <p>“How did things become like this between us? Fu Bainian, I asked you to wait for me, but why aren’t you willing to do so?”</p>
 <p>She broke down and sat on the ice-cold floor, wailing. Her tears on the floor were absorbed by the fabric of her clothes, causing her skirt to become partially wet, but she didn’t seem to notice.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, in the quiet bedroom, Fu Bainian was sleeping restlessly; his brows were tightly furrowed together. In his dream, he seemed to endlessly hear a woman’s mournful cry. He wanted to go console her, but his head felt too heavy so he couldn’t budge at all.</p>
 <p>After a long while, Lan Jinyao stood up, her head feeling groggy and distended as she walked out of the bathroom. When she passed by the bedside, she glanced at Fu Bainian’s chest and her vision blurred once again. She quickly walked out of the bedroom and slammed the door shut. She curled up on the sofa and slept there for the rest of the night.</p>
 <p>In her sleep, she kept shouting the name of a man, and then kept repeating a sentence: <em>Fu Bainian, you promised me that you’d never let me down and never let me feel hurt or sad...</em></p>
 <p>The next morning, Fu Bainian had already left when she woke up. She was laying on the bed in the bedroom and was covered with a thin quilt. Moreover, the basin of water that she’d brought into the room last night had already been taken away. It was evident at a glance that Fu Bainian was the one who did all of this.</p>
 <p>She massaged her aching head and crawled out of bed with great difficulty. She then walked out to the lounge area, but there was no sight of Fu Bainian. In the dining room, there was breakfast on the table. The rice congee was still steaming hot, so it seemed that Fu Bainian had left not to long ago.</p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao stared at the breakfast, and her lips curled up into a sneer.</p>
 <p>“Fu Bainian, if you don’t love me anymore, why should you be so nice to me? If you still love me, why do you do all of this and hurt me?”</p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao sat down at the table and expressionlessly ate her breakfast. She was trying to suppress her inner agitation as she didn’t want to feel any negative emotions and hurt the baby as a consequence.</p>
 <p>After finishing her breakfast, Lan Jinyao went out. She decided to go out on her own and take a stroll. When she was in a better mood, she would try having a good talk with Fu Bainian. Maybe the incident last night was just a misunderstanding. She didn’t want to be sad over something that might have been a misunderstanding.</p>
 <p>Fu Changning happened to be on holiday and called Lan Jinyao. As soon as she opened her mouth, she said sweetly, “Sister-in-law!” Upon hearing this, Lan Jinyao felt a bubble of warmth in her heart.</p>
 <p>“Sister-in-law, you don’t have to work these coming days, and I happen to be free. Let me accompany you on a stroll. Your work is really tiring, so let me help you relax a bit, alright?”</p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao had just returned home to have a good rest, and coincidentally, Fu Changning was also on annual leave. Knowing that she was back, Changning wanted to accompany her.</p>
 <p>How could there be so many coincidences in this world? Qian Ran must have said something to Fu Bainian, and then Fu Bainian called Fu Changning today.</p>
 <p>“Since you’re free, come over and keep me company! I happen to have nothing to do these days, and I was afraid that I wouldn’t be able to find anyone to go shopping with me.”</p>
 <p>She immediately agreed and made an appointment to meet at a shopping mall.</p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao, who was disguised, saw Fu Changning at the entrance of the mall. The energetic Fu Changning waved at her with a bright smile on her face.</p>
 <p>“Sister-in-law, over here!”</p>
 <p>“Did you arrive early?!”</p>
 <p>“Nope, I also just arrived.”</p>
 <p>The two proceeded arm-in-arm, and Lan Jinyao thought: <em>Her current situation wasn’t that bad. At least she could still smile.</em></p>
 <p>However, very soon, she would know that even if it were a fake smile, she wouldn’t be able to squeeze it out.</p>
