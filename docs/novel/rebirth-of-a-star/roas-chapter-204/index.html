 <p style="margin-left: 20px;"><em>Ji Yunshu was an outstanding anthropologist who was transmigrated into the body of a mistreated young girl. To survive in her new circumstances, she could only rely on her wits and the knowledge she had accumulated in her...</em></p> 
 <p> <a href="/announcement/bpc-resumes-and-pgc-quiz-results">Read More...</a> </p> 
</div>
<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>At this moment, the atmosphere was a little tense.</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao tensed up entirely and didn’t dare to move, her hands balled into fists.</p> 
 <p><em>Why was there someone else there? Why didn’t she see him earlier?</em></p> 
 <p>“Who are you?”</p> 
 <p>As someone slowly approached her from behind, Lan Jinyao wiped the sweat from her forehead and turned around, facing the man with a smile on her face.</p> 
 <p>“Brother, I’m Jiang Cheng’s…” She paused, and then showed an embarrassed smile as she continued, “I used to live here.”</p> 
 <p>Upon hearing this, the man understood her message right away and laughed. “So, you were Young Master’s woman; you came today to tidy up Young Master’s remnants?”</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao breathed a sigh of relief. <em>It seemed that these people didn’t know what had happened between her and Jiang Cheng. If they knew that she was the one who’d sent Jiang Cheng to prison, they wouldn’t let her go. Therefore, she had to find a way to get away from here as soon as possible.</em></p> 
 <p>“He’s already dead, and in fact, there are no more remnants that need to be sorted out…” Lan Jinyao heaved a long sigh and melancholically added, “I just came back to have a look. In the future, I won’t come back anymore.”</p> 
 <p>The man smiled at her and straightforwardly said, “Yes, Young Master has already left us, so there’s no need to hold onto such a beautiful girl like you. Since you’ve looked around, you can leave. Don’t come back to this kind of place again.”</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao nodded. Right then, another man’s voice suddenly sounded from outside.</p> 
 <p>“Who are you talking to?”</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao’s expression turned somewhat unnatural at this point. She smiled and then waved to the man. “Then, I’m leaving first!”</p> 
 <p>“Okay!” The man then said to the other man, “No one!”</p> 
 <p>The man standing outside at the courtyard quickly strode over, and just as he brushed past Lan Jinyao, he swept a glance at Lan Jinyao’s side profile and frowned. Lan Jinyao quickened her pace, and after leaving the courtyard, she instantly ran away. Not long after, she hailed a taxi.</p> 
 <p>“Sir, please quickly drive away, someone is chasing me!”</p> 
 <p><em>It was normal for one or two of Jiang Baitao’s people to not recognise her, but there were certainly some who did. She wanted to openly make a deal with Jiang Baitao, so she couldn’t afford being captured by his people now.</em></p> 
 <p>“All right!”</p> 
 <p>As soon as the taxi driver stepped on the gas, the car sped away at lightning speed.</p> 
 <p>Half an hour later, Lan Jinyao arrived home. Meanwhile, Fu Bainian was sitting on the sofa, waiting for her. Upon seeing him, Lan Jinyao froze for a second. However, she quickly regained her senses and ran to Fu Bainian’s side. She sat down and affectionately asked, “How come you’re back so early today?”</p> 
 <p>Normally, at this time, Fu Bainian wouldn’t be back yet and she would eat lunch alone every day, for which she’d complained about several times. At this moment, Lan Jinyao felt a little guilty. Fu Bainian’s eyes were very sharp and he was currently staring at her with a piercing gaze. <em>She couldn’t let anything slip, or else he’d certainly pick something up.</em></p> 
 <p>“Why were you out for so long?” Fu Bainian’s voice sounded a bit unhappy. “It’s not safe out there right now. Even if I send someone to secretly protect you, something could still go wrong.”</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao then coquettishly said, “I’m sorry, dear…I was bored, so I stayed out for a little longer.”</p> 
 <p>Seeing her like this, Fu Bainian didn’t have the heart to blame her any more. He sighed helplessly. “If you’re truly bored, you can call me and I’ll come back to accompany you. At least I can protect you.”</p> 
 <p><em>It turned out that he’d come back early to accompany her because he was worried that she would be feeling bored on her own.</em> Lan Jinyao’s heart instantly melted upon realising this. </p> 
 <p>She leaned against Fu Bainian’s chest and murmured, “Fu Bainian, you are so good to me. You wouldn’t act this way towards other women, would you?” <em>Especially that Yin Yun, who’d stayed by Fu Bainian’s side for so long that she fell in love with him. At that time, he must’ve been very good to her. He was the type of person who would do things seriously when he set his mind to it, even if it was just putting on an act.</em></p> 
 <p>Fu Bainian softly smiled and replied, “No, I won’t. You clearly know that there’s only you in my heart.”</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao grinned. <em>She knew that of course, but she would still get jealous sometimes.</em></p> 
 <p>At last, Fu Bainian didn’t question her any further. Lan Jinyao put down her bag and went to the kitchen to prepare lunch. She’d stayed in Jiang Cheng’s study for so long that she was about to starve to death.</p> 
 <p>While Lan Jinyao was humming a song and preparing lunch, Fu Bainian’s eyes suddenly fell on her bulging handbag. As she loved makeup, Lan Jinyao’s bag was usually filled to the brim with cosmetics.</p> 
 <p>“What’s in there?” <em>When she came back earlier and saw him, she’d subconsciously hid her bag behind her.</em></p> 
 <p>Fu Bainian assumed that she had something in there that she didn’t want him to see. </p> 
 <p>Following this, their meal was eaten in silence. Lan Jinyao had, in fact, wanted to say something several times, but in the end, she let it be.</p> 
 <p>After lunch, Fu Bainian had to go back to work. Before he left, he planted a kiss on Lan Jinyao’s head and whispered, “I’ll take care of that matter promptly and, very soon, you’ll be able to live your life without any worries again.”</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao nodded. She believed in Fu Bainian. Even Jiang Cheng’s matter had been taken care of smoothly, so she believed that everything would be over soon.</p> 
 <p>However, after Fu Bainian had left, Lan Jinyao suddenly remembered that he’d come back to accompany her because he was worried about her. She’d initially thought that he would stay longer and accompany her for a stroll, yet he left right away.</p> 
 <p>“Could it be that Fu Bainian came home specifically to have lunch with me?”</p> 
 <p>But, her intuition told her otherwise. <em>Something must’ve changed his mind halfway.</em></p> 
 <p>Suddenly, her eyes fell on her bag, which hadn’t been touched by anyone.</p> 
 <p><em>If Fu Bainian knew what she was about to do next, he would’ve certainly stopped her. Since he was so concerned about her, he wouldn’t allow her to take any risks. However, all of this started because of her, so she had to take care of it herself.</em></p> 
 <p>After taking a nap, Lan Jinyao went out again. She kept the leather notebook close to her bosom as if she were carrying a treasure.</p> 
 <p>She was going to make a deal with Jiang Baitao, so she could only go all out.</p> 
 <p>The Jiang family’s manor was located in the city centre with the best geographical location. It wasn’t very far from their place; only twenty minutes drive away.</p> 
 <p>While Lan Jinyao was sitting nervously in the taxi, there was a black Bentley secretly following behind.</p>
