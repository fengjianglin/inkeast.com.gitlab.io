 <p><b>Chapter 177 - A Little More Ruthless (1)</b></p>
 <p><span style>“Men nowadays sure are ruthless. To think that he’d be even hurt his own wife. You didn’t see it, but his wife was entirely covered with blood. I heard that she'd been drugged. When she was sent here, her complexion was ashen as if she was on her last breath.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t think that person was her husband. How could one be so ruthless?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the hospital’s corridor, a group of interns were currently having a heated discussion. Meanwhile, Jiang Cheng was anxiously waiting outside the operating room. When he’d brought Lan Jinyao over, the bloodstains on her skirt were nearly dried already. Her eyes were tightly shut, and she looked very weak as if she was about to breathe her last.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This time, he wouldn’t allow her to die, because he was afraid that he wouldn’t be able to find her once she started crossing the river to the afterlife.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>That chitter-chatter was really irritating like flies buzzing in his ears; he couldn’t take it anymore and restlessly punched the wall, letting a muffled sound reverberate within the corridor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Following that, a nurse walked up to him and stiffly said, “This wall is public property of the hospital. Please act more civilized, and don’t behave in such a crude manner. If you damage the wall, as a consequence, you’ll need to pay for it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Cheng retracted his hand and faced the nurse with a darkened expression. “So annoying! Say another word and I wouldn’t mind adding your medical expenses to the bill.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The nurse quickly trotted away and muttered on her way, “How can such a good-looking man have such a bad temper?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other nurses also quieted down immediately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Cheng then sat down on a bench and propped up his forehead with his hands. His face was twisted with pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lan Jinyao, please be alright; nothing must happen to you. The Heavens gave you a second chance to let you live on healthily, so you wouldn’t die, would you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Lan Jinyao’s pale face suddenly popped up in his mind. The look of disgust and resentment he’d seen before she’d closed her eyes made his heart bleed. However, he couldn’t help it. She should’ve been his, and not off having children with others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thinking up to here, the look in his eyes was resolute and sinister.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since you already hate me, adding on a bit more hatred won’t matter!” </span><i><span style>Fu Bainian wasn’t worthy of her at all.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Soon after, the lights in the operating room dimmed and a doctor in a white coat walked out. The doctor then explained, “Her vitality has been greatly damaged, but fortunately, her life isn’t in danger. Let her stay in the hospital for observation and so she can slowly recuperate. Although we’re using the highest grade of medicines for her treatment, there could still be some side effects that might impact future pregnancies.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only upon hearing this did a trace of joy appear on Jiang Cheng’s face. “Thank you, Doctor!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The doctor calmly nodded and then left, heaving a sigh as he murmured, “Young’uns nowadays really don’t know how to cherish themselves. They like to mess around, yet the ones always getting hurt in the end are their own lovers.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Cheng thought: </span><i><span style>If Lan Jinyao were his wife, he’d certainly not torture her like this. It was just that she’d chosen the wrong person to love. However, mistakes could be rectified. Everything that he was doing now was for the sake of helping her correct her mistakes. If he didn’t do so, she’d only become sadder in the future.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Afterwards, the nurses moved Lan Jinyao from the operating room to the general ward, and Jiang Cheng followed behind the stretcher. As his eyes landed on the weak-looking Lan Jinyao, he felt his heart ache for her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as he was about to follow them into the ward, his phone suddenly rang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The patient is resting now. If you want to answer the phone, please do so in the hallway!” said the head nurse impatiently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Cheng then halted his steps and answered the call.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you have something to report, shoot!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“President Jiang, Fu Bainian has already reported this incident, and the police are now involved in the investigation. Moreover, someone took a picture of you carrying Lan Jinyao into the hospital and posted it online, so Fu Bainian is most likely already on his way there. Do you want to evacuate and move to another hospital?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon hearing this, the corners of Jiang Cheng’s lips slightly curved up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s right on time. And here I was worried about him not being able to find the hospital. You don’t have to worry about the next steps; I’ll handle things from here onwards.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So what if Fu Bainian came? He couldn’t take her away anyway.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>When Lan Jinyao opened her eyes, she saw Jiang Cheng tightly holding onto her hand and staring at her without blinking. She ferociously retrieved her hand and then slapped him across the face. She’d used quite a lot of strength, so Jiang Cheng’s cheek immediately flushed red with her palm print.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My child...is my child gone?” Lan Jinyao trembled and asked in a quivering voice. </span><i><span style>Her baby must be gone. Otherwise, she wouldn’t be in so much pain, and she wouldn’t have shed so much blood.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Cheng nodded and softly said, “Your child is gone, but the doctor said that your body is fine. If you want to have children in the future, you can still…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before he’d managed to finish his sentence, Lan Jinyao’s hand flew towards him again while she yelled, “Jiang Cheng, you made me lose my child; will you still allow me to have a second one? You’re practically deranged! You’re already beyond redemption!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>She’d initially thought that there was still hope and that he could become a better person. This was because he’d left her with such a good impression at the beginning that she’d thought that as long as she stayed away from him, she’d be fine. But, now things had turned out like this instead. If she’d known this earlier, she wouldn’t have let this man approach her, and she wouldn’t have sent a private message to a stranger.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Cheng chuckled and stared at her like a lunatic as he said, “That’s right, I already knew that I was beyond redemption, so you shouldn’t have believed that I’d change for the better. If only you hadn’t eaten the food that I’d prepared for you, then your child might have survived.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Cheng then approached her and added, “Lan Jinyao, Fu Bainian will be here in a minute. Look out the window. I’m currently waiting for him." </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao’s gaze followed the direction Jiang Cheng had pointed in and saw a well-disguised gunman on the roof of the building opposite the hospital. The muzzle of the gun was pointed towards them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha!” Jiang Cheng was quite pleased with her frightened expression. “As soon as he’s here, the gunman will shoot him in the head. That scene...I feel good just thinking about it. When the time comes, he’ll fall apart like a smashed watermelon; its red juices dripping all over the floor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao’s whole body trembled due to her anger. “Would you dare do that? Jiang Cheng, would you dare? If you do that, you’ll be executed by a firing squad.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Right, she didn’t have to worry, because Jiang Cheng wouldn’t dare do that. He certainly wouldn’t want to go to prison and stay there for the rest of his life. Besides, this was a hospital, so who’d dare to open fire so blatantly?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Cheng’s laughter became more sinister by the minute, and he looked at her like he was looking at an idiot.</span></p>
