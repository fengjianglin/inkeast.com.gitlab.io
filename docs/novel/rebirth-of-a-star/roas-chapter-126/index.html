 <p><strong>Chapter 126 - Falling From Grace (5)</strong></p>
 <p>In the evening, Lan Jinyao was sitting on the hospital bed, holding a magazine that the nurse had given her and slowly flipping through it.</p>
 <p>When Xiaolin came to visit again, she was extremely secretive. Seeing that no one was in the room, she quickly closed the door. Once she sat down, she asked Lan Jinyao, “Sis Meimei, Brother Li has already here today, so he won’t come again this evening, right?”</p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao realised that Xiaolin had something to say to her, so she shook her head. “I don’t think he will. Is there something that you want to tell me, Xiaolin?”</p>
 <p>Xiaolin nodded. “I have something that I want Sis Meimei to look at. Since I’ve already seen it, I can’t just pretend that I don’t know anything and let Sis Meimei be injured for nothing.”</p>
 <p>“What is it?” Lan Jinyao’s curiosity was piqued.</p>
 <p>Xiaolin pulled out her phone from her pocket and handed it to Lan Jinyao. “Take a look at it yourself, Sis Meimei. This is the video that I took that day, and it shows the truth about your injury.”</p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao stared at the video playing on the phone without blinking. While watching, she sighed, “Xiaolin, your skills are pretty good; maybe you should change professions to be a cameraman.”</p>
 <p>Xiaolin shyly bowed her head. “It’s just a hobby and not good enough to show in public.”</p>
 <p>After that, she urged Lan Jinyao, “Sis Meimei, this isn’t the point, alright? You should fast-forward the video and play the part where you and Xu Hao fought.”</p>
 <p>Seeing her eagerness, Lan Jinyao smiled and in repeatedly said, “Okay, okay!”</p>
 <p>She stroked the video progress bar below the screen with her finger, and the movement of the figures on the screen sped up. Soon, she stopped and looked at the woman on the screen in shock.</p>
 <p>In the dark, no one noticed Shen Wei’an throwing a small stone. It distracted Xu Hao and consequently, the sword in his hand, which had been replaced, pierced Lan Jinyao’s chest.</p>
 <p>Although Lan Jinyao had already guessed everything, once she saw the madness and resentment in Shen Wei’an’s eyes at that moment, she still couldn’t stop herself from trembling, as though she had no self-control.</p>
 <p>Even though it was dark, the resentment in Shen Wei’an’s eyes was visible.</p>
 <p>Xiaolin gripped her hand. “Sis Meimei, don’t be afraid. Now that you’re in the hospital, what would Shen Wei’an dare do to you?”</p>
 <p>The girl’s palm was hot, and it drove away her chilliness. As Lan Jinyao turned her head to look at Xiaolin sitting beside the bed, an idea popped in her mind.</p>
 <p>“Xiaolin, can you do something for me? I’m worried that Shen Wei’an won’t just leave the matter at that. She’ll definitely kill me next time!” The look in her eyes was somewhat frightened.</p>
 <p>Xiaolin frowned, and then solemnly nodded. “Alright, I will help you. Just tell me what I can do, Sis Meimei!”</p>
 <p>“I suspect that Shen Wei’an swapped the swords. If we can find evidence, we can prove that Shen Wei’an deliberately tried to kill me. I want you to help me find that evidence!”</p>
 <p>“Me? Can I?” Xiaolin looked at her incredulously.</p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao nodded. “Believe in yourself, Xiaolin, you can surely do it.”</p>
 <p><em>If it was Li Qi, Jiang Cheng would undoubtedly have some precautions against him. But, if it was the simple and naive Xiaolin, Jiang Cheng may let down his guard.</em></p>
 <p>Seeing that Lan Jinyao trusted her so much, Xiaolin’s eyes welled with emotions and soon glistened.</p>
 <p>A beat later, Xiaolin asked her, “But, I don’t know how to find evidence. This video on my phone accidentally caught Shen Wei’an; it wasn’t intentional.”</p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao knew that Xiaolin wasn’t very confident.</p>
 <p>She softly said to Xiaolin, “I know where the evidence is; President Jiang has it. If you can steal the evidence and give it to me, Shen Wei’an will be done for.”</p>
 <p>Once Xiaolin heard the name ‘President Jiang’, she was instantly afraid. “The evidence is with President Jiang? Sis Meimei, I’m afraid, I don’t dare do anything to him.”</p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao crossed her arms over her chest and hugged herself as she said in a pained voice, “Could it be that I should just accept my injury?”</p>
 <p>And thus, for the next half an hour, Lan Jinyao tried to convince Xiaolin. Eventually, Xiaolin was brainwashed and promised to help her find the evidence.</p>
 <p>However, their plan couldn’t keep up with reality. Xiaolin found the evidence they needed, but it was snatched away by Shen Wei’an.</p>
 <p>When Xiaolin, who blamed herself, stood crying in front of Lan Jinyao, Lan Jinyao couldn’t vent her anger any longer.</p>
 <p>She could only suppress the irritation within her heart and gently console Xiaolin. “It’s alright. Even if it was discovered by Shen Wei’an, there is nothing she can do about it.”</p>
 <p>“But...but this way we can’t get Shen Wei’an charged with a crime!”</p>
 <p>“Nevermind, we are very compassionate people. Let her off just this one time for now. That woman is so rotten that she’ll certainly make another move,” she tried to comfort the sobbing Xiaolin, as well as her agitated heart.</p>
 <p>“Make another move?!” Xiaolin couldn’t help but scream. “Don’t tell me that you’ll be hurt again, Sis Meimei?”</p>
 <p>Before Lan Jinyao could open her mouth to respond, Xiaolin shouted, “I’m not afraid of Shen Wei’an, I can stay by your side and protect you! I won’t let that woman hurt you again!”</p>
 <p>As a result, Lan Jinyao smiled. “How could I be hurt so easily? Not to mention, with the lesson this time, I’ll definitely be more cautious in the future.”</p>
 <p>Xiaolin felt relieved, and told her, “Then, you should be careful, I’m leaving now.”</p>
 <p>After Xiaolin had left, Lan Jinyao turned off all the lights in the room. In the darkness, her black eyes were shining brightly.</p>
 <p>Since the evidence was snatched away by Shen Wei’an, then she had to let that woman off for now. But, her purpose couldn’t be abandoned halfway; she had to give that woman a little lesson.</p>
 <p>The next day, Shen Wei'an’s name was on the most searched list. The first one was: The popular actress Shen Wei'an once again hooks up with a married man and comes between the married couple’s relationship. Since then, Shen Wei'an’s name has become a synonym for ‘mistress’. The second one was: Shen Wei'an deliberately makes things difficult for the production crew and the actress she’s acting along with, even causing them deliberate harm.</p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao looked at the news on her phone, a corner of her mouth lifting.</p>
 <p><em>Shen Wei’an, although I can’t promote you personally, these things aren’t too much different. Don’t you like fame? I’ll let you taste the feeling of falling from grace!</em></p>
 <p>Soon, the production crew leaked the news about the decision to remove Shen Wei'an from the cast. In response, Jiang Cheng only said eight words in front of the reporters, “She’s vicious, merciless, and her conduct is poor.”</p>
 <p>Consequently, the public’s opinion was confirmed by this one sentence.</p>
 <p>Afterwards, Lan Jinyao never saw Shen Wei’an among the production crew again. Lan Jinyao thought that she might’ve left with the evidence and was preparing to make a comeback.</p>
 <p>However, Lan Jinyao still wondered about one thing; <em>had Shen Wei’an found out about the evidence on her own or had someone deliberately revealed it to her?</em></p>
