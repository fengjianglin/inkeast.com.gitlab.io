 <p><b>Chapter 161 - Drawing A Clear Line (4)</b></p>
 <p><span style>Yin Yun seemed to have gone crazy. She kept struggling, but her mouth was covered by Jiang Cheng, and she couldn’t move her body due to the tight hold he had around her. She could only let out slight sounds through her nose as a sign of her anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Yin Yun’s gaze changed. She shook her head violently, and when Jiang Cheng’s grip loosened, she opened her mouth and bit his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tss…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sound of breathing could be heard as Jiang Cheng fiercely furrowed his brows and pushed Yin Yun away. With the force of his shove, her body was like a broken kite and immediately fell to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You crazy woman!” Jiang Cheng cursed as he looked down at his arm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From Lan Jinyao’s point of view, Jiang Cheng’s arm had already turned red with blood oozing out from the spot that Yin Yun had bitten. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jiang Cheng, I think you’d better go to the hospital and take care of that wound. Maybe the doctor will give you a rabies shot.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yin Yun’s sorry figure lay on the ground, and her eyes were bloodshot as if she hadn’t slept all night. And, after Lan Jinyao said those words, Yin Yun suddenly burst out laughing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chen Meimei, you’re so concerned about this man? Do you care that much about him? President Fu’s suspicions were right. You and this man really have an abnormal relationship. Do you know why President Fu’s hand was injured and what caused the wound on his arm?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Cheng’s expression suddenly darkened, and he walked step by step towards Yin Yun. Even when Lan Jinyao felt frightened when she saw the angry look on his face she, yet Yin Yun was still sitting there on the ground. If it were her instead, she would’ve stood up long ago and fled. </span></p>
 <p><span style>They were both crazy, with one being more insane than the other!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s this man’s fault! The gunshot wound was left by this man, and President Fu already knows everything. Do you think President Fu will still like you? President Fu didn’t tell you because he didn’t want to inadvertently alert the enemy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shut up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shut up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those words were almost spoken in unison. After Lan Jinyao and Jiang Cheng roared at Yin Yun, their expressions turned stiff.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao repeatedly shook her head, and then her cold gaze landed on Jiang Cheng. She asked him, word for word, “Jiang Cheng, is what this woman said true? Did you really cause the injury on Fu Bainian’s arm?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It was a gunshot injury, no wonder... It had been so many days already, but when she accidentally pressed the wound on Fu Bainian’s arm, he would still break out in a cold sweat.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Cheng lowered his head and didn’t answer her question, but Lan Jinyao felt that he’d already silently admitted it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She then asked Yin Yun, “You say Fu Bainian suspects that I have an abnormal relationship with Jiang Cheng. Did Fu Bainian personally tell you that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>How could Fu Bainian suspect her? That wasn’t possible, and she absolutely wouldn’t believe it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao had been persistently pursuing the truth, but the truth was out so quickly and had almost caught her off guard. She was so shocked; she couldn’t react immediately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yin Yun laughed and said, “Of course! In addition to asking me to put on an act with him, he also wants to use you to oppose this man. Don’t you feel that President Fu’s recent attitude towards you is a bit too intimate?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao had almost believed her words, and her emotions had nearly fallen apart at this point, but Yin Yun’s tone inadvertently revealed a trace of complacency which quickly made her sober up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She almost fell for Yin Yun’s scheme. Recently, Fu Bainian had indeed been treating her very well and was very gentle and cautious with his actions. However, she knew that all this wasn’t because Fu Bainian wanted to use her to take down Jiang Cheng, but because Fu Bainian wanted to take good care of the baby in her womb.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yin Yun, you think you’re so amazing, but let me warn you; don’t you ever appear in Fu Bainian’s and my life again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao’s gaze then landed on Jiang Cheng, and she added, “Jiang Cheng, you as well, don’t you ever appear in front of me again. As for Fu Bainian’s injury, we’ll give everything back to you one day.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t listen to that crazy woman, I…” Jiang Cheng tried to defend himself and walked slowly towards Lan Jinyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao quickly entered the house and closed the door. Standing behind the door, she shouted, “I don’t care whether what Yin Yun said is true or not. Fu Bainian will eventually tell me in person, and I’ll believe him instead of an outsider.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It went completely silent outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao clutched her rapidly beating heart and peeked through the peephole.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, she saw Jiang Cheng, who looked like an evil spirit from hell, walk towards Yin Yun with a sinister expression. Only now did Yin Yun seemingly feel afraid; she hurriedly stood up and started screaming. Then, she staggered along the wall as she ran towards the gate. Her scream attracted a group of security guards, but Jiang Cheng’s pace didn’t slow down at all, and the two ran out in pursuit of one another.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not long after, the doorbell rang, and Lan Jinyao peeked through the peephole again and saw that it was the group of security guards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Were those two people your guests?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao shook her head in a panicked state and said, “No, don’t let them in casually like this in the future. I’m worried that those two will come here harbouring evil intentions.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The security guards were taken aback by her expression and manner of speaking. “Okay, we’ll strengthen our supervision in the future.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the security guards left, Lan Jinyao closed the door again and lay down on the sofa. Her fight with Yin Yun earlier had made her feel a little uncomfortable now, but luckily her abdomen wasn’t in pain. Her heart, on the other hand, was beating very fast, and there was a thin layer of sweat in the palms of her hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The script was placed beside her, but she was no longer in the mood to read it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Following this, Lan Jinyao slowly shut her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>She’d drawn a clear line with Jiang Cheng today, so hopefully, he wouldn’t come to bother her anymore.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, Lan Jinyao didn’t understand why Jiang Cheng would bother her to no end. It was clear to her that they’d never crossed paths before. As for Jiang Cheng’s face, she was 100% sure that she’d never seen it before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Jiang Cheng didn’t know that she was Lan Jinyao, then she would’ve surmised that Jiang Cheng liked Chen Meimei and thus kept pestering her; even though she was already a married woman. However, the fact was that Jiang Cheng already knew her secret.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hence, Lan Jinyao felt that there were a lot of doubtful points.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, she suddenly remembered the incident with the fire that she’d experienced for the first time in her life and the man who’d died.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the fire, on a quiet night, Lan Jinyao had done something out of the ordinary. At that time, she didn’t have too many fans on Weibo, so she’d spent a little effort and found the person who’d interacted with Chen Meimei before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She sent that person a note.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t blame you. I hope that your paradise contains no darkness and only sunshine. I’m not Chen Meimei, but another soul, and for that, I’m sorry about this incident.”</span></p>
