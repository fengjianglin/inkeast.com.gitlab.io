 <p>Li Qi was very efficient when it came to work. After the funeral, she stayed another night at the hotel, and then the next day, she was notified by Li Qi that he’d found a new place for her. Moreover, the apartment was fully furnished, so Lan Jinyao could move in empty-handed.</p> 
 <p>She took two days off to go shopping for some decor for her new home.</p> 
 <p>When she went out in the morning, she coincidentally ran into Fu Bainian. She smiled brightly and greeted him, “Good morning.”</p> 
 <p>Fu Bainian was seemingly stunned, he froze for a second before he recovered and acknowledged her. Afterwards, he left in a hurry.</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao followed him and said with a smile plastered on her face, “President Fu, are you going to work now? I asked for leave today to buy some things. I just moved in today, so we’ll be neighbours in the future; I’ll invite you to dinner tonight to celebrate!”</p> 
 <p>Fu Bainian nodded perfunctorily and then walked straight to the garage.</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao’s lips curled and she also went on her way. <em>She reckoned that, at present, Jiang Cheng was still chasing after Chen Meimei, and Shen Wei’an had already been eliminated. There was still a long road ahead for them to walk and enjoy!</em></p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao didn’t buy a lot of things, because she wasn’t planning on living there for long. In fact, she’d long thought of a plan to get closer to Fu Bainian.</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao finished decorating her home that same day. In the evening, Li Qi came over with a bottle of red wine and some food. Lan Jinyao fell into a trance as she stared at the food on the table. <em>When she was Chen Meimei, she’d refused to eat this kind of lavish meal, and she still found it hard to eat so many dishes at once.</em></p> 
 <p>“Li Qi, are you trying to fatten me up?”</p> 
 <p>Li Qi sat down and poured two glasses of wine. He handed one over to her and smiled as he said, “Does it really matter? Moving to a new home is a happy occasion, so it’s okay for you to eat some more. By the way, would you like to invite President Fu over? After all, he’s just living next door.”</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao cast a suspicious glance at Li Qi. <em>This guy…didn’t he warn her just a day ago to not get close to Fu Bainian? How come he’s changed his mind so quickly?</em></p> 
 <p>Li Qi hurriedly explained, “Don’t stare at me like that. Since President Fu already knows that you live next door, we should invite him over out of respect. It wouldn’t be nice of us to not invite him, right?”</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao excitedly snapped her fingers and said, “You’re completely right! I’m going to invite President Fu over right now!”</p> 
 <p>“Wait!” Li Qi pulled her back.</p> 
 <p>“What’s up?” Lan Jinyao looked back at Li Qi.</p> 
 <p>“You should stay here; I’ll go invite President Fu. We must avoid arousing suspicions at all cost!”</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao shook her head and heaved a sigh as she sat down. However, when she saw the figure tailing behind Fu Bainian, she understood what Li Qi had meant by ‘avoid arousing suspicions’.</p> 
 <p>He not only invited Fu Bainian over, but also Chen Meimei.</p> 
 <p>As soon as Chen Meimei came in, she bravely punched Lan Jinyao lightly in the chest and said, “Hi new neighbour, thank you for your hospitality today!”</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao’s smile was somewhat stiff as she replied, “My pleasure.”</p> 
 <p>It was a good thing that Chen Meimei came over. After all, there were some things that she wanted to clarify with her as soon as possible. <em>For example, she must let Chen Meimei know that she also had feelings for Fu Bainian, lest Chen Meimei becomes hurt in the future.</em></p> 
 <p>As soon as Chen Meimei sat down at the table, she started to eat and drink gluttonously. She didn’t pay attention to her image in front of Fu Bainian at all. Before digging in, they each poured a glass of red wine, but the remaining half of the bottle was downed by Chen Meimei alone.</p> 
 <p>When Chen Meimei went to the lavatory, Lan Jinyao quickly followed her.</p> 
 <p>Chen Meimei looked at her suspiciously and asked, “Why are you following me to the lavatory?”</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao dry-coughed twice and solemnly said, “You have a little fan on Weibo, and he likes you a lot. He’s…the Young Master of the Jiang family, perhaps you can give him a chance and hook up with him.”</p> 
 <p>“Are you ill or something? The entire world knows that the person I like is Fu Bainian.”</p> 
 <p>“Now, you can’t like Fu Bainian anymore, because Fu Bainian is mine.”</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao then turned and walked out. Chen Meimei was stunned, and it took her a while to recover her senses. She hurriedly shouted at her back, “Explain your words clearly! What do you mean by…?”</p> 
 <p>When Lan Jinyao walked out of the lavatory, she froze. Li Qi and Fu Bainian happened to be standing at the door with petrified expressions on their faces.</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao coughed. “What’s the matter?”</p> 
 <p>“It’s nothing.”</p> 
 <p>Fu Bainian responded before turning and walking back to the dining table. Li Qi gave Lan Jinyao a thumbs up and whispered, “You’re awesome!”</p> 
 <p>When the four sat back down at the dining table, the atmosphere had turned somewhat strange. Lan Jinyao felt that the way Chen Meimei was looking at her was as if she wanted to tear her to a thousand pieces on the spot.</p> 
 <p>Chen Meimei finally left after glaring at her for an hour.</p> 
 <p>As Lan Jinyao stared at Fu Bainian’s departing figure, the corners of her lips quietly curled into a smile.</p> 
 <p>The next day, the company hosted a dinner party. It was a small party, but many people came. Under normal circumstances, Lan Jinyao would never have attended such a party, but it was different this time.</p> 
 <p>The spot next to Fu Bainian was in high demand; every female artist wanted to have it, but it was, unexpectedly, occupied by Li Qi.</p> 
 <p>When Lan Jinyao walked into the hall, Li Qi quickly stood up, and he gestured her over with his hand. “Come over here and sit down quickly.”</p> 
 <p>There were jealous and envious gazes everywhere, but Lan Jinyao just turned a blind eye to them.</p> 
 <p>When the waiter placed a peculiar-looking wrapped gift in front of everyone, Lan Jinyao noticed that Fu Bainian sitting beside her was stunned for a moment; as if he hadn’t expected it.</p> 
 <p>Aside from Fu Bainian, everyone eagerly opened the gift box in front of them.</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao couldn’t bear it anymore; she leaned over and whispered, “President Fu, aren’t you curious about what’s inside yours?”</p> 
 <p>Fu Bainian fixed his gaze on her for a long while before slowly opening the gift box.</p> 
 <p>The diamond shined brightly under the light, its lustre was very dazzling.</p> 
 <p>“It’s a wedding ring!” shouted someone in the crowd.</p> 
 <p>“A wedding ring!”</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao quickly picked up the ring and wore it on her ring finger. She then exclaimed, “It’s just right! President Fu, are you…proposing to me?”</p> 
 <p>Fu Bainian didn’t respond, and he simply stared at her with an indecipherable look in his eyes.</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao took a deep breath and returned the ring to Fu Bainian. She then opened the gift box in front of her.</p> 
 <p>“It’s a ring, too!” someone else exclaimed.</p> 
 <p>“Why did she get a ring too? It’s not fair.”</p> 
 <p>“What do you mean by not fair? Can’t you see that it was something that Movie Goddess Lan prepared herself?”</p> 
 <p>At this time, the waiter brought over a bouquet of flowers. Lan Jinyao took the flowers and handed them to Fu Bainian. Fu Bainian, on the other hand, didn’t react for a long time, and the discussion around them grew louder by the minute.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this, Lan Jinyao whispered in his ear, “President Fu, this is really embarrassing, quickly accept it!”</p> 
 <p>Fu Bainian’s Adam’s apple moved, and he softly asked, “Do you know what it signifies when I accept it?”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Lan Jinyao smiled nonchalantly. “Of course I know.”</p> 
 <p><em>Accepting this bouquet signifies that we’ll be spending the rest of our lives together, forever.</em></p>
