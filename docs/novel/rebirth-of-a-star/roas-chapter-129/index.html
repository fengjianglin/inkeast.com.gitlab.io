 <p><strong>Chapter 129 - Despair (2)</strong></p>
 <p>“It’s uncertain whether this drama will continue after everything that happened with Shen Wei’an. If it doesn’t continue, wouldn’t Chen Meimei be coming home tonight? Don’t you think so, Fu Bainian? Hey, where are you going?”</p>
 <p>Twenty minutes ago, Fu Bainian was still working overtime at the company, but then he’d returned home to an empty living room. All of this was caused by Shen Yu’s simple guess.</p>
 <p>The moment he opened the door, his sight darted to the slippers on the shoe rack. Lan Jinyao hadn’t returned yet.</p>
 <p>Fu Bainian didn’t turn on the light. Instead, he sat on the couch and started to laugh. “Fu Bainian, look at your appearance…”</p>
 <p>Abruptly, a light flashed in the dark living room; it was a new text message being sent to his phone.</p>
 <p>For the past few days, he hadn’t deleted any messages sent by Lan Jinyao. All were left in his inbox, but he hadn’t replied to any of them. Although he wanted to hear her voice, he didn't want to call her, and he instead chose to work to paralyse himself.</p>
 <p><em>Fu Bainian, just let me go, okay?</em></p>
 <p>He never wanted to hear that kind of plea for a second time.</p>
 <p>“Fu Bainian, do you miss me? I miss you so much, but I still won’t return for a while. There are rules on the contract, so I can only return home once I finish the shoot, remember to wait for me!”</p>
 <p>Fu Bainian rigidly stared at the text message on the phone. After a good while, there was the sound of a heavy object falling to the floor in the deathly quiet living room. The phone screen shattering with the impact.</p>
 <p>He’d thought that he wasn’t a violent person but recently, in a short period, he’d already smashed two phones.</p>
 <p>Fu Bainian clutched his head, his expression somewhat pained.</p>
 <p>In the dark, a series of footsteps was heard rushing into the room.</p>
 <p>“Brother, are you alright? I just heard a loud noise coming from the living room…”</p>
 <p>The moment the light turned on, Fu Changning yelled, “Brother, what happened to you?!”</p>
 <p>She rushed over and supported the man lying on the couch.</p>
 <p>After a while, Fu Bainian replied, “I’m fine, it’s just a headache. Why are you here?”</p>
 <p>“Sis-in-law isn’t here, and yet you don’t go home to eat, so Mum told me to here to see you. Brother, why don’t you come home and stay for about two days? Just stay until Sis-in-law returns, okay?”</p>
 <p>Fu Bainian’s sight landed on the smashed phone. A beat later, he nodded, “Let’s go!”</p>
 <p>The two of them got on the car and returned to the Fu residence.</p>
 <p>In H City. Lan Jinyao stared at her phone in a daze. After a while, she murmured, “Did he blacklist my number? Why is that his phone is always turned off every time I call, yet Li Qi can get through?”</p>
 <p>She thought for a moment and suddenly waved at Li Qi, who was calling for her.</p>
 <p>Li Qi came over and looked at her in confusion. “What’s wrong, Meimei? Is there something wrong with your phone? I’ll check it for you. The Director is calling you, so hurry up and find him.”</p>
 <p>But, Lan Jinyao didn’t give him her phone. Instead, she extended her hand towards him. “Lend me your phone.”</p>
 <p>Li Qi was confused, but he still gave her his phone.</p>
 <p>With an uneasy feeling, Lan Jinyao once again dialled Fu Bainian’s phone. When she heard the familiar female voice on the phone, her heart calmed down.</p>
 <p>She gave the confused Li Qi a smile as she returned the phone to him before walking towards the set.</p>
 <p>Li Qi stared at the outgoing call and was still puzzled.</p>
 <p>The drama didn’t seem to be affected by the absence of Shen Wei’an. The day after Shen Wei’an’s news was in the media, a person who was going to be replacing her appeared. This made Lan Jinyao suspect, not for the first time, whether it was guessed what would happen. Due to this, Jiang Cheng was able to arrange all of this in advance.</p>
 <p>However, over the next few days, everything went surprisingly smoothly. It was just that she felt that her physical condition wasn’t very good. She wasn’t sure what was wrong though.</p>
 <p>It was until one day, when she suddenly woke up from her dreams, that she realised that her period was late.</p>
 <p>Standing in front of the mirror in the bathroom, Lan Jinyao was dumbfounded as she stared at herself. There seemed to be no other abnormality except that her complexion wasn’t very good.</p>
 <p>Taking advantage of the dark, she covered herself completely, then went to the pharmacy and bought a pregnancy test. She was like a thief. She would take two steps before stopping and looking around, afraid that someone would follow her.</p>
 <p>When Lan Jinyao saw the results, she screamed and attracted the attention of Li Qi and Xiaolin.</p>
 <p>“What happened? Sis Meimei, did you see a cockroach?”</p>
 <p>“What happened, Meimei?”</p>
 <p>Upon seeing two shadows appear through the blurry glass door of the bathroom, Lan Jinyao subconsciously threw the pregnancy test into the toilet and flushed it away.</p>
 <p>“It’s nothing; I just saw a cockroach.” Her eyes were darting everywhere.</p>
 <p>Xiaolin whispered, “I’ve said it before, but this room definitely isn’t clean. I’ve seen a cockroach too before. I told Li Qi, but he still doesn’t believe me.”</p>
 <p>Li Qi indeed didn't believe it; whether it was before, or at this moment.</p>
 <p>He looked at Lan Jinyao, suspicions rising in his heart. It didn’t show up on his face as he said, “How about you change to another room tomorrow, Meimei?”</p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao quickly refused. “No point, we won’t be here for much longer, we return home after three days.”</p>
 <p>Three days later, the show officially wrapped up. Following this, there was editing and publicity. But, on the day Lan Jinyao decided to join the production team, she told Jiang Cheng that the latter promotions must be handled by Jiang Cheng as she wouldn’t attend.</p>
 <p>“That’s good. Then, just be careful as the bathroom floor is quite slippery; don’t slip when you see another cockroach.”</p>
 <p>After saying a few words, Li Qi dragged Xiaolin away.</p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao didn't notice the strange look Li Qi gave her. She couldn't help smiling. She had intended to send Fu Bainian a text message, but it suddenly occurred to her that she would be back in a few days anyway.</p>
 <p>She thought: <em>Who told Fu Bainian to not reply to her text messages or pick up her calls!</em></p>
 <p>However, Lan Jinyao didn’t think that when she would return home three days later, that between her and Fu Bainian, there would be a vast ravine separating them. In the middle of the abyss, the further one walked, the more one suffered.</p>
 <p>And, at that time, the happy news that would’ve made everyone happy was never announced...even her miscarriage.</p>
