 <p>When the weather cleared up, Lan Jinyao felt a lot better, and she went out in a cheerful mood.</p> 
 <p>It just so happened that Fu Changning was on holiday, so she came over to keep her company. When the two women met, they naturally went to the shopping mall. Fu Changning hooked her arm around Lan Jinyao’s, and they shuttled through all the cosmetics stores and high-end clothing boutiques in the mall.</p> 
 <p>As Lan Jinyao stared at the broad smile on Fu Changning’s face, she couldn’t help but chuckle. It seemed as if the person who’d been locked up at home all day wasn’t her but Fu Changning.</p> 
 <p>“When you’re alone, don’t you go out for a walk or shop around? How come you seem so much happier than me while shopping?”</p> 
 <p>Fu Changning extended her index finger and shook it in front of her. “No, no…how boring is it for me to go shopping alone? Besides, I’ve been working overtime these days, so I didn’t even have the time to rest. Look at my haggard appearance. I rarely get a chance to come out, so of course I’m happy.”</p> 
 <p>As she spoke, the smile on Fu Changning’s face suddenly disappeared. “Sis-in-law, I’m sorry…when you were framed and locked up, it must’ve been very boring in that detention centre. To make up for that, I’ll spend this beautiful day with you and help you retrieve your happiness.”</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao nodded. She’d stayed at home for so long that she was nearly suffocating to death, so as soon as the danger was over, she went out.</p> 
 <p>Unbeknownst to her, this day was destined to be turbulent.</p> 
 <p>After Fu Changning entered a clothing store, she quarrelled with a woman. The two resembled proud peacocks with overbearing auras, and neither of them would give way to the other. They both eyed a piece of clothing from the limited edition collection, but there was only one piece left in the store… </p> 
 <p>Fu Changning was never one to be provoked, so they started quarreling right on the spot. Seeing that the two were about to fight, Lan Jinyao hurriedly tugged at Fu Changning, and said, “Changning, how about we let her have this dress? This dress doesn’t really suit you; it will make you look older than you are. A young and beautiful girl like you should wear something lovelier and more vibrant.”</p> 
 <p>Fu Changning glanced at the dress once more before nodding. “Sis-in-law, you’re right. Now that I’ve taken a closer look, it does look a bit old-fashioned. Since she wants it, then I’ll just let her have it!”</p> 
 <p>The woman instantly flared up upon hearing Fu Changning’s understatement. She pointed at Fu Changning and scolded, “Who do you think you are?! Do I need you to yield to me?!”</p> 
 <p>Fu Changning indifferently replied, “Then, what about you?! Even if I were to give it to you, you have to think twice yourself. Do you…really deserve it?”</p> 
 <p>“You’re telling me that I don’t deserve it?! Haha…”</p> 
 <p>The woman’s gaze suddenly fell on Lan Jinyao, and before Lan Jinyao could even react, the woman started verbally assaulting her.</p> 
 <p>“Aren't you that murderer? What, you’ve already been released by the police?”</p> 
 <p><em>Murderer?</em> Lan Jinyao’s hands instantly balled into fists as she rebuked, “Miss, don’t you watch the news? If you say another word, I’ll sue you for libel.”</p> 
 <p>The woman cast a peculiar glance at Lan Jinyao, and asked, “You said that you’d sue me for libel? How dare you say that I’m slandering you? As expected, birds of a feather flock together. I don’t want this dress anymore! If you want it, then quickly take it away lest it irks my eyes.”</p> 
 <p>After saying this, the woman turned and was about to leave. However, how could a hot-tempered person like Fu Changning let her leave just like that? She swiftly grabbed the woman by the collar and pulled her back.</p> 
 <p>“What did you mean? Explain your words clearly to me!”</p> 
 <p>The conflict between the two women worsened to the point that they started attacking each other with their hands and feet.</p> 
 <p>Seeing this scene unfold, Lan Jinyao hurriedly said to the Shop Assistant, “Quickly come and give me a hand! We need to separate these two!”</p> 
 <p>The Shop Assistant hesitated and didn’t move.</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao then added, “Don’t belittle a woman’s combat power! When they start fighting, I’m afraid that you’d have no choice but to discard all the clothing in your store afterwards.”</p> 
 <p>Upon hearing this, the Shop Assistant wavered and she scurried over. Lan Jinyao also hurriedly walked over to grab ahold of Fu Changning, but right at that moment, a hand suddenly pushed her, and she staggered a few steps back before she managed to stabilise herself. She stood outside and stared helplessly at the scene inside the clothing store. Just as she was about to go in again to help, a hand suddenly reached out and covered her mouth.</p> 
 <p>Although this happened in broad daylight, no one noticed her being kidnapped. Moreover, Fu Changning was too busy quarrelling with the other woman to notice what was happening outside.</p> 
 <p>When Lan Jinyao woke up again, she found herself in a car. She massaged her forehead before peeking in front of her.</p> 
 <p><em>This…was the way to Fu Bainian’s company!</em></p> 
 <p>“Who are you?” Lan Jinyao cautiously asked.</p> 
 <p>The man in the driver’s seat was wearing a hoodie, and his head was covered by the hood, so she couldn’t see who it was.</p> 
 <p>She abruptly extended her hand to pull the hood off the man’s head, but the man seemed to have guessed her movement, and he quickly turned the steering wheel. Due to inertia, Lan Jinyao’s body slammed against the door.</p> 
 <p>“Who are you?!” Since he dared to openly lay hands on her, the first person that came to mind was the man who was caught a few days ago by the security guards at her community.</p> 
 <p>“You should be able to guess who I am, right? I was present that day at the press conference.”</p> 
 <p>Upon hearing this, Lan Jinyao’s heart sank, and her voice began to tremble as she said, “Y-you’re…Jiang Cheng?”</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao shook her head and murmured, “No, that’s not possible; I saw his face that day at the security booth…he wasn’t Jiang Cheng.”</p> 
 <p>The man in the driver’s seat suddenly laughed. His voice was low and hoarse, and sounded somewhat spooky. <em>This wasn’t Jiang Cheng’s voice.</em></p> 
 <p>The man then unhurriedly said, “Chen Meimei, speaking of acting skills, mine are much better than yours. Hence, you couldn’t recognise me.”</p> 
 <p><em>He really is Jiang Cheng!</em></p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao instantly panicked, and at the same time, her hand came in contact with an object. <em>It was her mobile phone. She’d initially had two mobile phones with her; she’d bought one herself, and she’d received one from Bainian. The one given to her by Bainian must’ve been confiscated by Jiang Cheng.</em></p> 
 <p>Upon noticing her mobile, Lan Jinyao gradually calmed down.</p> 
 <p>“Jiang Cheng, weren’t you dead? How come you’re still alive?”</p> 
 <p>Jiang Cheng laughed. “Do you wish for my demise that much? Unfortunately, Jiang Baitao won’t let your wish come true. He’ll do everything in his power to let me live on peacefully.”</p> 
 <p>“That’s right!” Lan Jinyao’s voice suddenly went a few octaves higher as she added, “Fu Bainian and I truly wish you were dead, because your very existence makes us restless.”</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao took advantage of her roaring voice to mask the sound that came with pressing the speed-dial key. <em>Now that she’d pressed the button, Fu Bainian would surely know that she’d been kidnapped!</em></p> 
 <p>“Jiang Cheng, I don’t want to see you make an appearance in my life ever again!”</p> 
 <p>Her words made Jiang Cheng’s blood boil in anger.</p> 
 <p>“In that case, let’s go to hell together!”</p>
