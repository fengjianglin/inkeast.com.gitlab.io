<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Old Chen had to leave for an appointment right after lunch, so he bade his farewell and told Qingqing with a smile that she was welcome to visit more often. From his expression, one could see that he didn’t say that out of politeness, but out of sincerity. Qingqing also smiled back at him and expressed that she definitely would.</p> 
 <p>When they finished eating, Qingqing didn’t leave. Instead, she sat on the sofa watching TV, as if the Chen family’s manor was her own home.</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao and Chen Meile stood in the hallway, both observing her with a disagreeable expression.</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao asked, “Sis, now that Dad has met Qingqing, what will he be thinking? Will he harbour any suspicions after noticing the similarities between Qingqing and Meimei?”</p> 
 <p>Chen Meile bitterly answered, “Do you think just anyone will think of such an outrageous thing as rebirth? However, if Qingqing deliberately implies something, then my Old Man will certainly become suspicious.”</p> 
 <p><em>That’s right. After all, Qingqing had impersonated Meimei so well in front of Old Chen, without even the slightest flaw…</em></p> 
 <p>When her thoughts got to here, Lan Jinyao chanced a gloomy glance at the figure sitting in the living room.</p> 
 <p>Chen Meile then suddenly said, “You’re right! Everything in the Chen family is mine, and Meimei is my biological sister, so what’s mine is also hers. However, I definitely won’t allow an outsider like Qingqing, who’s impersonating her, to snatch away or destroy any of this!”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Lan Jinyao wordlessly patted Chen Meile on the shoulder. Only now did she calm down and feel somewhat at ease. At the very least, Chen Meile was on her side.</p> 
 <p>“Then, I’m going first. Be vigilant when dealing with that woman, she knows a lot.”</p> 
 <p>When Lan Jinyao was about to leave, she suddenly heard someone approaching her from behind. She initially thought that it was Chen Meile, but when she turned around, the person she saw turned out to be Qingqing. At that instant, the smile hanging on her face instantly disappeared into nothingness.</p> 
 <p>“What? You can’t smile when you’re graced with my presence?”</p> 
 <p>Qingqing stood in front of her with her arms crossed and a provocative smile on her face.</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao stared at her expressionlessly for a second before turning around to leave. <em>She really didn’t want to mingle with this vicious woman who had a poisonous heart and a face thicker than the Great Wall of China!</em></p> 
 <p>However, she’d only taken two steps forward when Qingqing seized her arm, holding her back as she asked, “Don’t you want to have a one-on-one talk with me? About…you substituting someone else to marry Fu Bainian?”</p> 
 <p>“Substitute? Do you really think that I’m like you?” Lan Jinyao sneered and shook Qingqing’s hand off.</p> 
 <p>Even though she’d lost a lot of weight, her strength was still there, so the moment she shook off Qinqing’s hand, there was a sullen groan. Upon catching that abnormal sounding grunt, she instantaneously noticed that something was off.</p> 
 <p>This time, it was Qingqing who wanted to turn and leave, but Lan Jinyao didn’t allow her to do so.</p> 
 <p>“Wait! What do you mean by that? The person in Fu Bainian’s heart has always been me. Aren’t you the one who knows this the best?”</p> 
 <p>Only Shen Wei’an knew about this, so just a second ago, Lan Jinyao re-ascertained that Qingqing was Shen Wei’an.</p> 
 <p>Qingqing, however, didn’t want to stay around Lan Jinyao for even a minute longer. She walked away at lightning speed.</p> 
 <p>As Lan Jinyao stared at the departing figure, the corners of her lips slightly curved upwards. She then quickened her steps and chased after Qingqing, smiling evilly as she asked, “Why aren’t you talking to me? Where are you rushing to? Could it be that you have a stomachache, so you’re looking for the lavatory?”</p> 
 <p>When Qingqing was about to cross the threshold, Lan Jinyao ran a step ahead to block her path and quickly clutch her arm. At that instant, warm liquid slowly seeped through the Qingqing’s shirt. Upon seeing this, Lan Jinyao increased the strength of her grip and asked through gritted teeth, “Don’t you have anything to say to me?”</p> 
 <p>Qingqing didn’t respond and continued struggling while more and more blood seeped through her shirt. Afterwards, Chen Meile walked over and coldly asked, “What’s going on?!”</p> 
 <p>Only then did Lan Jinyao seemingly regain her senses; she stared at Qingqing in astonishment and abruptly let go of her hand. “Oh my…you’re bleeding! Don’t tell me that it was my fault? Your arm is bleeding excessively! Looks like it needs to be taken care of immediately.”</p> 
 <p>“Meimei, did you do this? Qingqing is a guest invited here by the Old Man. How can you be so rude and hurt her to this extent?”</p> 
 <p>Chen Meile followed along and angrily questioned.</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao feigned ignorance and responded, “I didn’t exert a lot of strength, so how come your arm’s suddenly bleeding?”</p> 
 <p>Qingqing raised her head and said through gritted teeth, “This has nothing to do with you, it’s my own fault. I’m going to the hospital now, so please let me go.”</p> 
 <p>“No, it’s too much trouble for you to go all the way to the hospital for this kind of small injury. We have a first aid kit at home, so I can help you patch it up. Sis, go get the first aid kit!” Lan Jinyao urged before forcefully dragging Qingqing back into the living room.</p> 
 <p>Chen Meile conceded and unhurriedly walked away. Qingqing tried to break free several times, but it was to no avail. </p> 
 <p>“Stop moving!” Lan Jinyao chided. “Doesn’t it hurt? I’ll help you bandage it well, don’t worry.”</p> 
 <p>After lifting Qingqing’s sleeves, the gauze wrapped around her arm came into view. When Lan Jinyao saw that, her lips curled up into a cold sneer. “Why is there only a thin gauze wrapped around your wound? Is it possible that you were afraid people would find out about your injury?”</p> 
 <p>At this moment, Chen Meile handed over a pair of scissors and Lan Jinyao used it to cut the gauze apart, revealing a ghastly wound. <em>This wound truly looked horrendous!</em> Lan Jinyao thought, slightly stunned.</p> 
 <p>It wasn’t a knife wound. It looked like a badly festering skin ulcer.</p> 
 <p>“What’s the matter? Why aren’t you dressing it yet?” Qingqing, as if she’d expected her look of disappointment, smiled and asked. </p> 
 <p>As Lan Jinyao studied Qingqing’s sinister smile, a thought suddenly dawned on her. <em>This ought to be a knife wound, but Qingqing didn’t know how to deal with it properly, so it festered badly and became like this.</em></p> 
 <p><em>She was the one who’d attacked her that night!</em></p> 
 <p>“I’ll bandage it for you right away, but your wound has become badly infected. If you don’t take care of it soon, then maybe your entire arm would need to be discarded. Sis, get me a knife and sterilise it. I need to cut off this part of rotten flesh for her. If not, then I’m afraid her entire arm will be crippled.”</p> 
 <p>Qingqing’s eyes widened at the mention of this. “Wha-what did you just say? You want to cut off this part of rotten flesh for me?!”</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao stared at her and said matter-of-factly, “Don’t you want this arm anymore? This is basically common sense, alright?”</p> 
 <p>Qingqing abruptly stood up and grabbed a piece of gauze. She then quickly wrapped it around her arm and hurriedly said, “I’ll go to the hospital to let them treat this, it’s too unsanitary for you to do it like this.”</p> 
 <p>Then, without waiting for a response, she ran outside.</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao and Chen Meile looked at each other and then burst into laughter.</p> 
 <p>“I should’ve acted faster and cut it off for her,” Lan Jinyao playfully remarked.</p> 
 <p>“Looks like we have no more use for these things…” Chen Meile lamented.</p> 
 <p>After this episode, Lan Jinyao left the Chen family’s manor. <em>Looks like Qingqing’s killing intent towards Fu Bainian and her had intensified tremendously. With Jiang Baitao backing her up, things would become much more troublesome, so she must step up her game and make a move soon.</em></p>
