 <p><b>Chapter 176 - Coping With Bereavement (2)</b></p>
 <p><span style>“I need a doctor. Jiang Cheng, please save me, my stomach really hurts!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao grasped Jiang Cheng’s hand tightly. She used so much strength that Jiang Cheng’s arm turned slightly red. However, she couldn’t help it as he was her only hope at this moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How did this happen?” Jiang Cheng nervously asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao repeatedly shook her head as she said, “I don’t know. I just slept for a little while and then my abdomen started to hurt. Jiang Cheng, please, find me a doctor!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Subconsciously, she knew that it was practically impossible to find a doctor in the middle of the sea, but she couldn’t help but continue crying for help.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Those who hadn’t been pregnant before couldn’t possibly understand the agony she was feeling at this moment. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>She didn’t know exactly what had gone wrong, but she was clearly still fine before they’d departed the island. However, that couldn’t prove anything. Perhaps, all those things that she’d gone through in the past few days were too much of a burden and her body couldn’t cope with it, resulting in this kind of situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Cheng picked her up in a princess hold and gently placed her on the bed. He then anxiously asked, “Is it excruciating? I’ll go get you a doctor.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Where could he find a doctor on a yacht with only two people?</span></i><span style> Lan Jinyao watched Jiang Cheng hurriedly leave and didn’t stop him. People always liked to look forward to miracles, so she’d just treat this as some kind of self-comfort and hope for a miracle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A minute later, a miracle happened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Lan Jinyao was about to pass out from the pain, a doctor in a white coat came in, carrying a medicine box in his hand. Lan Jinyao cried, “Doctor, please, please save my child!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, she felt something flowing out of her body and a strong sense of fear shrouded her in an instant. </span><i><span style>She had a feeling that she was going to lose the baby...she wouldn’t be able to keep the baby!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Behind the doctor’s gold-rimmed glasses were a pair of cold and gloomy eyes, without even a trace of pity in them. After examining the marks on the sheets, he shook his head as he faced Jiang Cheng and said, “The child is already gone, and she has to be sent to the hospital as soon as possible as there could be residue left in her body.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon hearing this, Lan Jinyao felt a burst of pain in her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did things turn out like this? Why?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tears continuously streamed down her face and blurred her line of sight. In this instant, she seemed to see an image of Fu Bainian appear in front of her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Cheng no longer had a nervous look on his face. He held Lan Jinyao’s hand and said, “As soon as we reach the shore, I’ll take you to a hospital. You’ll be fine; trust me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao stared at him with bloodshot eyes; she then extended her hand with great difficulty and tugged at his shirt, asking through gritted teeth, “The yacht hasn’t stopped sailing yet, so how could there be a doctor on board? Jiang Cheng, tell me, where did this doctor come from?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The caring facade on Jiang Cheng’s face finally disappeared and was replaced with a sinister smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Doctor has been aboard all along. I was afraid that you wouldn’t be able to handle the trip, so I invited a doctor here for you. With him by your side, I would feel much more at ease.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao burst into tears again; her heart was full of remorse.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>A calculating man like him, who’d sneak behind her and secretly stalk her, would definitely have a problematic personality. How could she have ever believed his words?!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>She was truly stupid!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>To think that she’d actually believed in a psychopath!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Jiang Cheng, get out of here. I don’t want to see you! If you hover in front of me again, I’ll make sure to drag you to the afterlife to keep my child company!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao grabbed an object from the nightstand and flung it towards Jiang Cheng’s head. He quickly took a step back and dodged the object.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fine, I’ll go out first. I won’t remain and disturb you further, so don’t be angry. We’ll reach the mainland soon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they left and closed the door, Lan Jinyao lay on the bed with a pale complexion. She felt like dying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of this was a scheme devised by Jiang Cheng. He knew that she was pregnant, so he didn’t want to let her child off. Since the moment she’d escaped from the house, he already had everything set in stone. He’d forced her in a tight spot and made her starve. Then, he was worried that she would faint from hunger, so he gave her an apple and a bottle of water to keep her going until the evening. He knew that as soon as it got dark, she wouldn’t be able to hold on any longer and, at this time, the yacht suddenly appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What a perfect plan he’d devised! He’d schemed everything, including those dishes on the deck. He must’ve added abortion herbs to the food, but he was worried that after she had the abortion, she wouldn’t be able to bear it, so he arranged a doctor in advance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao lay in bed, frowning in pain with tears continuously sliding down her face. When one of her hands touched the bedsheets, she felt a sticky substance, and she could seemingly smell the strong scent of blood.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That was her baby...it was supposed to have been happily born into this world, but now it had come ahead of time before it had even grown up properly.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>At this thought, she broke down again and closed her eyes as she painfully sobbed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her current appearance was like that of a person on the point of demise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Cheng, who was standing outside, tightly clenched his hands into fists and frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He then coldly asked, “How long will she be in pain?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just now, Lan Jinyao’s complexion had turned excessively pale; she’d looked like a person who’d been fished out of the water, and her entire body was soaking wet from her sweat. He was just watching quietly on the side, but he could feel her pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The doctor indifferently said, “It will hurt for a long time, so as soon as we get ashore, you’ll send her to a hospital, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What about painkillers? Would it help?” asked Jiang Cheng through gritted teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It would help, but would you be able to feed it to her? Didn’t you see the cold look in her eyes earlier? It was filled with hate; as if she wanted to pounce on you and bite your neck off. Normally speaking, if a patient doesn’t cooperate, it’s very difficult for the doctor to treat them, and now we’re in the same kind of situation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Cheng clenched his hands into fists and ferociously hit the wall, leaving two slight blood marks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll take her to a hospital right away!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Now that he’d done it, he shouldn’t regret it, because, in this world, there was no medicine for regret, and there was no use crying over spilt milk. Moreover, she’d hated him since long ago, so what did it matter if she hated him more now? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The yacht sailed at lightning speed like a fish across the sea.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On board, it was extremely quiet; only light sobbing sounds could be heard coming from Lan Jinyao’s room. Her sobs were extremely quiet as if she could stop breathing at any moment.</span></p>
