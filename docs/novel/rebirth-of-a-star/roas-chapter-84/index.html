 <p><strong>Chapter 84 - Lan Xin’s Conspiracy (6)</strong></p>
 <p><em>“The whole world knows that President Fu doesn’t like Chen Meimei!”</em></p>
 <p><em>“President Fu only married Chen Meimei because of pressure from his Mother.”</em></p>
 <p><em>“He was just acting along with the circumstances!”</em></p>
 <p>These words echoed over and over in Lan Jinyao’s mind. Even though she kept telling herself that that bunch of girls were just talking nonsense, she still felt anger boiling in her heart, and she arrived home with a dejected expression.</p>
 <p>After Fu Bainian had sold Chen Meimei’s house, he’d moved everything from Chen Meimei’s room to his place, and that included the recliner placed on her balcony.</p>
 <p>Whenever she felt down, she would pour herself a glass of red wine and sit on the recliner on the balcony, slowly savouring her glass of wine sip by sip.</p>
 <p>It was currently around 9 PM, and since Fu Bainian had gone to attend a business dinner and hadn’t returned yet, Lan Jinyao was sitting alone on the recliner, looking at the scenery in front of her from the balcony. It seemed that all the lights in this neighbourhood were lit around this time.</p>
 <p>She stared at her old apartment opposite the balcony and saw that a new person had seemingly moved in. Before this, she’d met the couple that was living there after she’d moved out. This time, however, the new owner of the apartment appeared to be a very young man, but she couldn’t see the figure very clearly due to the distance and the reflection of the lights.</p>
 <p>While Lan Jinyao was inadvertently staring at the complex across from her, that young man seemed to also be looking in her direction. In this dimly lit night, it was quite difficult to see things clearly, so when she felt that gaze on her, she subconsciously felt a bit uncomfortable.</p>
 <p>She then quickly returned inside, but the man was still standing there, staring at her balcony. When she saw this, she couldn’t help but frown.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, her phone suddenly rang with a call from Fu Bainian.</p>
 <p>“Hello?!”</p>
 <p>“You’re downstairs? All right, give me a minute, I’ll be right down!”</p>
 <p>When Lan Jinyao had gotten off work she’d been in a bad mood, so she’d gone straight home. It was only now that she remembered that she hadn’t eaten dinner, but luckily she wasn’t too hungry.</p>
 <p>Fu Bainian was already waiting for her downstairs, so Lan Jinyao quickly changed her clothes and went out wearing an oversized hat. At the gate of the community, a black car was parked by the side of the road. Lan Jinyao had spotted the car at a glance when she’d arrived at the gate.</p>
 <p>“You’re so considerate. How did you know that I hadn’t had dinner yet?” Lan Jinyao gave Fu Bainian a bear hug as soon as she got into the car.</p>
 <p>Fu Bainian’s lips curled up into a smile, and he gently said, “Of course I know! Because, someone told me that tonight you might be too angry to eat, so he called me and asked me to take you to dinner.”</p>
 <p>“Li Qi called you?”</p>
 <p>“Yep!”</p>
 <p><em>Okay! It seemed like what had happened in the practice room was already known to everyone.</em></p>
 <p>Fu Bainian pondered for a moment before he said, “If you don’t feel comfortable over there, then you don’t have to participate in the newcomer training because you’re not a newcomer anyway! Besides, it’s just a waste of time for you to hang out with that bunch of girls all day.”</p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao glanced at him suspiciously and asked, “Hey! That’s not what you said last time.”</p>
 <p>“The past is done, and the present is now; I can’t just let my dear wife suffer like this! Besides, you never talk to me about anything work-related!”</p>
 <p>Hearing this made Lan Jinyao feel slightly wronged, so she gloomily said, “I just wanted to fix my issues myself.”</p>
 <p>“I know, that’s why I’ve never intervened!”</p>
 <p>Fu Bainian was staring ahead, his eyes focused on the road. Meanwhile, Lan Jinyao was staring at the side of his face, emotions welling up in her heart.</p>
 <p>“Thank you, Fu Bainian!” <em>Not for not intervening, but for understanding and trusting me.</em></p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao didn't expect to see Xiaomin in the restaurant. Xiaomin’s foot was injured, and although it wasn’t anything serious, she had still sustained an injury after all; shouldn’t she be resting at home instead? Yet, she’d come all the way to a restaurant to eat dinner.</p>
 <p>There was only one set of cutlery on Xiaomin’s table, and there weren’t many dishes, so it seemed that she was here alone.</p>
 <p><em>Eating alone in a restaurant seems kind of romantic.</em></p>
 <p>When Fu Bainian saw her staring at the table, he asked, “An artist from the company?”</p>
 <p>“Yep!”</p>
 <p>Xiaomin had seemingly sensed Lan Jinyao’s gaze, or, maybe this was something she’d planned, but when she’d lifted her head and looked over in Lan Jinyao’s direction, she appeared to be pleasantly surprised.</p>
 <p>Following that, Xiaomin trotted to their table and sat down on a chair uninvited as she exclaimed, “Big Sis Meimei, you're also here for dinner?!”</p>
 <p>“Mhm!” replied Lan Jinyao nonchalantly.</p>
 <p>Xiaomin glanced at Fu Bainian before quickly asking, “Big Sis Meimei, now that President Fu is accompanying you, you must be feeling better now. Today, those people really went overboard; you mustn’t take those words to heart. I believe that that matter has nothing to do with you.”</p>
 <p>At first, Lan Jinyao was confused as to why Xiaomin would deliberately mention this matter, but not long after she finally understood as Fu Bainian asked Xiaomin, “What did those girls say to Meimei?”</p>
 <p>His voice sounded somewhat gloomy like he’d been born with an imposing air.</p>
 <p>Xiaomin glanced at Lan Jinyao and appeared slightly awkward. However, the next second, she told Fu Bainian a spiced up version of events. She then stammered as she said, “B-but because I found glass shards in my shoes, everyone else thought that it was Big Sis Meimei’s doing. Thus, they said a few bad things about her behind her back. When Big Sis Meimei heard their accusations, she was quite depressed. In short, they were saying that President Fu, you...you don’t love Big Sis Meimei at all and that your marriage was just a political marriage. So, even if they say something behind her back, no one will get justice for Big Sis Meimei.”</p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao silently thought: <em>This little girl sure was something! Her foot was injured, so she, of course, didn’t want to let this matter go easily. But, since she couldn’t figure out who was the main culprit by herself, she wanted to borrow Fu Bainian’s hand to teach those girls a lesson.</em></p>
 <p>“Meimei, you didn't tell me any of this!”</p>
 <p>Fu Bainian held her hand, publicly displaying his affection without the slightest scruple.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing their hands clasped together, Xiaomin’s lips almost unnoticeably lifted in the corners.</p>
 <p>“I already told you that I’ll take care of these things by myself!” uttered Lan Jinyao as she pinched her brows, feigning a displeased expression.</p>
 <p>Xiaomin then said to Lan Jinyao, “Big Sis Meimei, I won’t disturb you two anymore, enjoy your meal. I’m leaving first.”</p>
 <p>After Xiaomin had left the restaurant, Lan Jinyao suddenly pulled back her hand and asked, “You’re not planning to intervene in this matter, right?”</p>
 <p>If Fu Bainian made a move, then it would become a big deal!</p>
 <p>Fu Bainian snorted, not denying nor conceding.</p>
 <p>Of course, he wouldn’t tell her. Someone had already come knocking on his door, so if he didn’t do anything, then Lan Jinyao’s standing would only become worse. He had to at least let those people know that they didn’t get married because of their family connection, but because of love.</p>
