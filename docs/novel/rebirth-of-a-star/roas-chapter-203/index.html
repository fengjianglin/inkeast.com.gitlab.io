<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>On the third night after her visit to the Chen family’s manor, Lan Jinyao received another phone call from Chen Meile. At this moment, she was driving to a restaurant to have dinner with Fu Bainian. Ever since the great success of ‘Twilight’, she would be recognised by people wherever she went. Actually, before going out, she didn’t completely disguise herself like how she would’ve in the past.</p> 
 <p>Chen Meile called not long after she’d left home. When Lan Jinyao saw ‘Sis’ flashing on her phone screen, an uneasy feeling washed over her. Last time, what was worrying Chen Meile the most was the fact that Qingqing would insinuate doubts into Old Chen’s mind, hinting that she was Chen Meimei. Old Chen was an astute person, so even if Qingqing didn’t reveal too much, he could easily guess the underlying meaning.</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao had a hunch that Chen Meile was calling her today about this matter.</p> 
 <p>“Sis, is there something wrong?”</p> 
 <p>“Yes, my Old Man specifically called me today to ask me what I thought of Qingqing. At that time, my mind was perturbed and I didn’t know to say. But, luckily, my Old Man also asked me several other questions and he didn’t question me further about Qingqing. If he had, I might have really slipped up and revealed your identity.”</p> 
 <p>Upon hearing this, Lan Jinyao breathed a sigh of relief.</p> 
 <p>However, Chen Meile added, “Sooner or later my Old Man will find out, and when that happens, I won’t know what to do. Meimei, you must hurry up and think of a way to get rid of that bothersome woman.” </p> 
 <p>“I understand.” </p> 
 <p>After the call ended, Fu Bainian cast her a sidelong glance and asked, “What’s the matter?”</p> 
 <p>“I have confirmed that Qingqing is Shen Wei’an. She underwent plastic surgery and appeared in front of us again to take revenge. Therefore, Chen Meile called to remind us that we must take care of her pronto; we can’t sit around and wait to die.”</p> 
 <p>Fu Bainian faintly nodded. “I’ve already made some arrangements.”</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao stared at him with a complicated look in her eyes.</p> 
 <p>“I can help you!” After a moment of silence, Lan Jinyao uttered this one sentence.</p> 
 <p>Initially, before she’d said this, she’d already expected that Fu Bainian would reject her and, as expected, he did exactly that. </p> 
 <p>“As long as you’re safe and sound, that is already your greatest support towards me. Jinyao, I don’t want you to get hurt, do you understand? That last incident really hit me hard, so I don't want to go through that again.”</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao wasn’t very happy with his answer, but she still sulkily conceded and said, “I’ll protect myself well. I also don’t want to experience that kind of thing ever again.”</p> 
 <p>Fu Bainian’s expression slightly darkened. <em>Since the both of them didn’t want to go through that kind of thing again, he must eradicate all threats!</em></p> 
 <p>The next day, Lan Jinyao got up very early. Even Fu Bainian looked at her in surprise. But, Lan Jinyao merely looked up at him and smiled without saying anything.</p> 
 <p>Although she looked unperturbed as she unhurriedly ate her breakfast, she was, in fact, very nervous because she was going to do something behind Fu Bainian’s back very soon.</p> 
 <p>Fu Bainian held the fork in his hand and paused for a moment. “Would you like to go out for a stroll today? I can accompany you.”</p> 
 <p>He’d left her alone these days, so he was afraid that she would feel bored staying at home all day. But, he also didn’t feel reassured letting her go out on her own, because right now was a very crucial period, and he couldn’t afford the slightest mistake.</p> 
 <p>His words made Lan Jinyao slightly flustered. Instead of looking up, she stared at her plate and said, “No need, I’ll be fine on my own. Nothing will happen in broad daylight.”</p> 
 <p>Before Fu Bainian could say another word, Lan Jinyao hurriedly added, “It really doesn’t matter. Besides, I’m just taking a stroll in the park; I’ll be back before you know it.”</p> 
 <p>Under Lan Jinyao’s continuous persuasion, Fu Bainian no longer insisted.</p> 
 <p>After breakfast, Lan Jinyao sat on the sofa and fiddled with her phone, acting as normal as she could. After Fu Bainian went out, she instantly got up and went out as well. She didn’t stop when she passed by the park; she instead hailed a taxi and headed towards a certain place.</p> 
 <p>Even after the death of its owner, this supposedly romantic place hadn’t become desolate. </p> 
 <p>The door to the courtyard was locked. Lan Jinyao was very familiar with this place that was filled with nightmarish memories. She knew where she could slip in without alerting the servants in the manor. Even though there was likely no one there at this moment…</p> 
 <p>After Lan Jinyao entered the courtyard from a side passage, she carefully advanced towards Jiang Cheng’s study to get something. Jiang Cheng hadn’t guarded against her one bit when she was there, so there were basically no secrets in this manor that she didn’t know about. She clearly knew where Jiang Cheng had stored his most important possessions. Probably, not even Jiang Baitao was aware of that.</p> 
 <p>Soon, Lan Jinyao got inside and went into the study.</p> 
 <p>Below Jiang Cheng’s desk there was a hollow space underneath the wooden planks, and there the secrets of the Jiang family were stored. She might not be able to fully control Jiang Baitao with this secret in hand, but she could certainly make a deal with Jiang Baitao and let him give up on Shen Wei’an.</p> 
 <p>It was very dark below and just as Lan Jinyao reached her hand into the hollow space and felt about, she suddenly heard voices coming from outside. It was two people talking.</p> 
 <p>“I’ve been here for days already, yet I still don’t know what secrets are hidden in this place that could make Second Master fret like that.”</p> 
 <p>“We’ve already turned this place upside down and still couldn’t find what Second Master is looking for. Sigh, let’s forget about it for now. Let’s have some food and drink first; we’ll leave when the sun goes down.”</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go with that. If Second Master asks, let’s just tell him that we couldn’t find it.”</p> 
 <p><em>What? Until the sun goes down?!</em> Black lines appeared over Lan Jinyao’s forehead. <em>It was currently early morning…if she really had to wait for them to leave before she could go out, didn’t this mean that she had to squat here all day?!</em></p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao heaved a long sigh before continuing to feel about. Then, she suddenly touched a leather notebook.</p> 
 <p>She tried to muffle her movements as much as possible, without making a sound.</p> 
 <p>There was plenty of light in the study, with the exception of that spot under the desk, so Lan Jinyao couldn’t see clearly what was written in the notebook in her hand. <em>Those two men must be looking for this. This notebook must be very important to the Jiang family.</em></p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao stuffed the notebook in her bag and quietly waited for an opportunity to flee. <em>Those two would certainly go out for lunch at noon, right? At that time, she would find a chance to sneak out.</em></p> 
 <p>Waiting there was especially boring, so Lan Jinyao squatted for a while before standing up again. She then went to sit on the sofa in the study.</p> 
 <p>At noon, those people went out, so Lan Jinyao’s chance finally arrived.</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao didn’t waste a minute; she immediately stood up and rushed outside. She stood at the entrance facing the courtyard and was about to leave when, suddenly, a fierce yell sounded behind her. </p>
