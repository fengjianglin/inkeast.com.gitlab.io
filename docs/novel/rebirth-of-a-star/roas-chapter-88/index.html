 <p><strong>Chapter 88 - Identity Exposure (3)</strong></p>
 <p>In the living room, no one spoke. It felt like it had been silent for a century, and there was only the faint sound of two people breathing.</p>
 <p>After ten minutes had passed, time began to flow once more.</p>
 <p>Chen Meile tried her best to restrain her inner emotions from affecting her expression and body movements.</p>
 <p>“Okay! Since Miss Shen has said this, if there is really nothing wrong with Miss Shen’s head, then I think that Miss Shen must have solid evidence. That’s why you came to our home, right?”</p>
 <p>Chen Meile leaned on the couch, her expression restored to its indifferent look.</p>
 <p>“I don’t have any evidence!” The smile on Shen Wei’an’s expression didn’t change. “Because it’s all too unimaginable. If I really had evidence, I would’ve already told the world. I came here today to tell you about my findings, that's all, it doesn't matter to me. The Chen family should do the rest of the investigation work!”</p>
 <p>Chen Meile was unmoved, and just sneered, “You planned it out well, but, I’ll tell you now, why should I investigate something that is so unlikely?”</p>
 <p>“Of course, you can choose not to investigate, what does it matter? Anyway, I just came to tell you my findings, that’s all, it doesn’t matter to me. I just think that someone is using Chen Meimei’s body to do bad things. When the time comes, it wouldn’t be a good thing for you and the Chen family,” Shen Wei’an said to provoke her.</p>
 <p>“Besides, don’t you want to prove that Chen Meimei actually died in that car accident?”</p>
 <p>Chen Meile suddenly raised her voice as she said, “Someone, send the guest off! I still suggest that Miss Shen visits a doctor. Otherwise, your situation will only get worse.”</p>
 <p>Shen Wei’an’s complexion was ashen as she was sent out by a servant, and the living room regained its quietness. Chen Meile sat alone on the couch, lost in her thoughts with her brows tightly wrinkled.</p>
 <p>After quite a while, she muttered, “Even if it’s true, what does it have to do with Shen Wei’an? Why is she suddenly meddling in this matter? What does she get from it?”</p>
 <p>“Hehe, she’s really insane! She could actually fabricate such a lie.”</p>
 <p>Even after thinking for a long time, Chen Meile still couldn’t figure out a reason, so she grabbed her car keys and headed out.</p>
 <p>“Why don’t you believe it? Chen Meile, what are you avoiding? Or, did you want to raise a puppet and be the only person who can inherit all of Old Chen’s wealth?”</p>
 <p>After stepping out of the Chen mansion, Shen Wei’an’s mouth continuously flapped, not stopping for at least half a minute.</p>
 <p>The more she thought about it, the more irritated she felt. Anyone with eyes could see the change in Chen Meimei. How can one person completely become another person? While Chen Meimei’s appearance hadn’t changed, her personality and behaviour had changed almost overnight. That was all she could think of; she believed that Xu Jin’ge, who’d been drunk, wouldn’t tell a lie.</p>
 <p>“Since she doesn’t believe me, then I will find a way to convince her! Lan Jinyao, even if you could start over a thousand times, I won’t let you live!”</p>
 <p>As if to express her ruthlessness, Shen Wei’an crushed a small patch of grass on the roadside under her foot, not stopping until her shoe was stained green.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>In the evening, Lan Jinyao suddenly received a call from Chen Meile. Chen Meile’s voice was still as loud and high-pitched as before. She told her to go to the usual place. The two sisters hadn’t met up for quite a long while now, so she asked Lan Jinyao to hurry up and go.</p>
 <p>After she’d finished saying what she wanted to, Chen Meile hung up the phone. Meanwhile, Lan Jinyao stared at the phone, completely dumbfounded.</p>
 <p>A moment later, she asked, “Where do Chen Meimei and Chen Meile usually meet?” <em>Is it the bar that she often goes to?</em></p>
 <p>Fu Bainian seriously thought about it for a while and asked her, “Do you want me to check?”</p>
 <p>Upon saying that, he received an eye roll from Lan Jinyao!</p>
 <p>Fu Bainian said innocently, “Don’t look at me with such a look. I didn’t know Chen Meimei at all before, so why would I pay attention to where the sisters would often meet?”</p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao thought that made sense. “All right, I forgive you!”</p>
 <p>“So, what are you going to do?”</p>
 <p>“What I'm going to do? I can’t call her back and ask her where is the usual place is, can I?”</p>
 <p><em>It looked like she could only go to that bar to try her luck.</em></p>
 <p>Half an hour later, Lan Jinyao arrived at the entrance of the bar. Li Qi, who hadn’t been seen for several days, was actually sitting in the bar together with He Xiaoyun. They were seemingly chatting away happily.</p>
 <p>She poked her head inside and looked around, and to her surprise, she really spotted Chen Meile. The woman was wearing a pair of high heels and sitting at the bar. She was spiritedly encouraging the bartender to drink with her and occasionally teasing him, resulting in the handsome young guy to flush a deep red.</p>
 <p>Lan Jinyao shook her head as she smiled in amusement before making her way towards the bar.</p>
 <p>“Sis!” She sat down beside Chen Meile and ordered a glass of wine.</p>
 <p>“You’re so bad. Be careful that the other party doesn’t lay a hand on you later.” Lan Jinyao glanced at the bartender as she ambiguously smiled.</p>
 <p>Chen Meile imagined it in her head. “You dare joke with your sister; I see that your skin is itching, huh?”</p>
 <p>“Haha, no, nothing. Come, let’s have a drink!”</p>
 <p>The two each downed a glass of alcohol. The two sisters of the Chen family were both bold and unrestrained, so even when drinking, they were naturally like men. A glass of alcohol was nothing.</p>
 <p>“So, what’s the matter that you came looking for me today, Sis? You wouldn’t be thinking of introducing me to someone again, right? I was finally able to catch Fu Bainian after so much difficulty, so please don’t give me any trouble.”</p>
 <p>As soon as she finished saying this, her forehead suffered a slap. Lan Jinyao rubbed her forehead and exaggerated her tone as she called, “Sis-”</p>
 <p>“What nonsense are you spewing? I know that it wasn’t easy for you to catch Fu Bainian. Not only do I know, but the whole world knows how good Fu Bainian is, yet he’s now been bound by Old Chen’s fatty. I’m looking for you today, merely to meet up. The two of us haven’t hung out for quite a while.”</p>
 <p>Indeed, Chen Meile was a very good sister to Chen Meimei. So good, that no words could describe it.</p>
 <p>“Hey, Hottie, hurry and give my sister a glass of her favourite drink!” Chen Meile waved at the bartender.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Lan Jinyao wasn’t sure whether it was the lighting in the bar that was flashing too often which made her have an illusion or not. She felt that Chen Meile was acting weird when she told the bartender to make her favourite drink.</p>
 <p><em>“Chen Meimei, the person really in your body is Lan Jinyao, right?”</em></p>
 <p>She didn’t know why, but Xu Jin’ge’s words suddenly echoed in her mind, which made her have a bad feeling.</p>
