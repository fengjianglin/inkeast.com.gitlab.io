 <p><b>Chapter 172 - Madman (3)</b></p>
 <p><span style>In the quiet room, the aunt slowly retreated as Jiang Cheng softly blew the steam coming from the bowl of soup. While Lan Jinyao watched his movements, her heart beat like a drum.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jiang Cheng!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>She rolled her eyes nimbly before calling out his name.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Cheng stopped what he was doing and looked up at her with a trace of doubt in his eyes as he asked, “Yes? What’s wrong?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao took a deep breath before saying, “In fact, you already know that I am me and Chen Meimei is Chen Meimei. My thoughts, memories, and character are all different from Chen Meimei’s. I’m just myself, but the person you used to like was Chen Meimei, right?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Cheng was stunned for a moment before nodding his head. “That’s right!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao then added, “But, the person you like now is me, right?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, he didn’t hesitate at all as he nodded and replied, “Correct!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>So, Lan Jinyao went on and said, “In that case, the main question I want to ask you is: How much do you love Chen Meimei, and how much do you love me? We’re not the same person to begin with; aside from this body, we are two completely different people. So, tell me, with you being so fickle, how can you make others believe that you’re actually an affectionate person?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past, when she was filming a case-solving suspense drama, she came into contact with this kind of brainwashing tactic. Though she wasn’t a professional in this field, she was able to apply the technique into practice. After she’d finished asking this, Jiang Cheng opened his mouth to say something, but no words came out. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Look, you’re actually a very sentimental person. To be precise, a so-called womaniser. You have money, authority, and a powerful background. You can have whatever you want, so I don’t understand why you have to pretend to be so infatuated. You expect me to believe that you are? No, there’s no way I’d believe that and Chen Meimei, who is currently watching us from above, won’t believe it either.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon hearing this, Jiang Cheng’s expression suddenly dimmed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ve talked so much until now, but what’s your purpose? To brainwash me? I’m telling you, it’s of no use, so don’t waste your time. I liked the former you, but I love the current you even more. If you don’t want to stay, you can go; just leave this body behind for me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Initially, when Lan Jinyao had heard him say ‘you can go’, she’d started to feel a rush of joy in her heart. However, Jiang Cheng’s latter words made her stare at him in shock.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>She could go, but her body had to stay. Didn’t this mean that he’d wanted her to die one more time? How could she give up so easily when the Heavens had given her a second chance?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I-I’m not leaving!” Lan Jinyao stammered for a long time before she finally managed to squeeze out these words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Cheng then smiled and said, “Now, this is how you ought to behave! Drink this chicken soup; weren’t you very hungry?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao’s eyes widened as she stared at the cup of chicken soup. A trace of fear flashed in her eyes as she refused, “No, I don’t want to drink this. Jiang Cheng, are you trying to kill me?" </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why would I kill you? This tonic soup is very nutritious. You’re truly too thin now like you could be blown away by the wind any minute, so you have to make up for it.” Jiang Cheng said as he approached her with a spoonful of soup.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao turned her face to the other side and coldly uttered, “Haven’t you ever heard of the saying that a weak person can’t handle strong tonic like this soup? I can’t handle a soup smelling so strongly of medicine.” </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>There was a mix of medicinal herbs in this! How could she know whether there were abortion herbs included or not? She insisted on not drinking. Even if she were to starve to death, she wouldn’t drink it.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“A weak person can’t handle strong tonic? Haha, you’re right, I was careless. In that case, let’s just eat rice!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao took advantage of this opportunity and requested, “You have to untie my hands and feet. I want to sit at the table and eat.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon hearing this, there was a slight change in Jiang Cheng’s expression. As soon as Lan Jinyao saw that, she immediately added, “I’m famished. Besides, there’s no one else on this island, so even if I wanted to, I wouldn’t be able to flee. Can’t you just sit beside me and let me eat at the table?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re much craftier than Chen Meimei, so I don’t believe you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao couldn’t take it anymore and angrily stated, “You’re a man! Don’t tell me that you can’t even stop a weak woman like me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Cheng indifferently said, “Your psychological tactics are useless against me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this point, Lan Jinyao gave up. She merely stared at the window and ignored him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A moment later, a faint ‘okay’ sounded in her ear, and she immediately turned her head around. “Then what are you still waiting for? Quickly untie me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, when Lan Jinyao saw the food on the table, she forgot all about the impending danger and started to wolf down the food. She was ravenous since she hadn’t eaten anything up until now. She’d also started to feel a bit dizzy due to hunger. What’s more, she was pregnant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After breakfast, Jiang Cheng had to leave. He changed from his casual clothes to formal attire; he must be going to work. Before he left, he gently smiled towards Lan Jinyao and said, “Remember to wait for me, and don’t try to escape from here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jinyao acknowledged him and naturally nodded. </span><i><span style>She’d be stupid if she didn’t flee. She didn’t want to remain even a minute longer at this eerie place. Besides, she had to wait until he was in a good mood for him to take her out of here? Who knows when that would happen?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>This time, Lan Jinyao’s hands and feet weren’t tied up, but the door was locked with a fingerprint lock and could only be unlocked with the owner’s fingerprint. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Lan Jinyao’s gaze suddenly fell on the maid’s hand.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Since Jiang Cheng had hired this aunt to take care of her, she should be able to come and leave freely, right? Would her fingerprint work?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The aunt was currently cleaning the table quietly with a very serious look on her face. From the first moment they met until now, Lan Jinyao hadn’t heard her say a word.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, she decided to test the waters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Auntie, doing this every day must be exhausting, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The aunt only lifted her head and glanced at her once before her gaze fell on the table again. She didn’t utter a single word.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Could it be that she’s mute?” Lan Jinyao murmured. </span><i><span style>But, Jiang Cheng wouldn’t hire someone who’s mute to accompany her, right? If that was the case, wouldn’t she suffocate to death from boredom? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>In the next second, the aunt finally spoke, “I’m not mute!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>She finally spoke! </span></i><span style>Lan Jinyao’s eyes suddenly lit up, and she thought: </span><i><span style>Since she wasn’t mute, then things would be a lot easier to handle.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m really sorry about that. It’s because I hadn’t heard you speak before. Have you worked here for a long time? Or were you hired by Jiang Cheng not long ago?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve worked here for a long time already, so I know very well how things work here. Miss Chen, don’t attempt to escape from here. I’m absolutely loyal to our Young Master.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Already mentioning loyalty? She hadn’t even said anything yet!</span></i><span style> Lan Jinyao lamented in her heart. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>No matter if the aunt were truly loyal or not, she’d break through her defences.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I won’t run away; I’m just asking because I wanted to learn more about Jiang Cheng’s preferences. He said that once he’s happy, he’d take me along with him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After she said these words, Lan Jinyao noticed that the aunt’s expression had relaxed.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>She’d found an opening!</span></i></p>
