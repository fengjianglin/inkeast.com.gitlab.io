<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao hadn’t watched the news for a long time, and she didn’t have a phone on her. So, after exhausting herself too much recently, she wanted to lay down and rest all day. Her mental state also wasn’t so good. When she stared at the TV screen for just a short while, she’d feel exhausted.</p> 
 <p>From the moment Li Qi had left the manor till now, his words kept echoing in Lan Jinyao’s mind, making her heart restless. Taking advantage of the fact that Jiang Cheng was at work, she decided to go to the living room and watch TV. The kind of hot entertainment news, like her divorce, would be broadcast and discussed for several days.</p> 
 <p>The news of her divorce had spread throughout the city. No matter which entertainment news channel she switched to, it was all about her and Fu Bainian.</p> 
 <p>This kind of news was revealed just before the release of ‘Twilight’. She could already imagine how terrible the box office sales would be when the time comes. <em>Jiang Cheng had said that he loves her, but how was this in any way shape or form considered love? He was practically trying to kill her instead.</em></p> 
 <p>The longer Lan Jinyao watched the news, the angrier she felt, resulting in the remote control smashing when she threw it away ferociously.</p> 
 <p>Then, holding back her rage, she returned to her bedroom.</p> 
 <p>At night, Lan Jinyao finally managed to fall asleep after a long time had passed, but she couldn’t sleep well; she dreamed of all kinds of strange things, and her brows were tightly furrowed together.</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao dreamt that Fu Bainian was laying in a pool of blood and he kept staring at her with his eyes wide open; he refused to close them no matter what.</p> 
 <p>As a result, Lan Jinyao abruptly woke up from her dream, and as soon as she sat up, she saw Jiang Cheng’s face close to hers; the tips of their noses were nearly touching. Lan Jinyao was still in her dream-like state as she extended her hand and slapped him across the face. The ferocious slapping sound was ear-piercing as it reverberated in the quiet bedroom.</p> 
 <p>Afterwards, Lan Jinyao finally returned to her senses and glared at Jiang Cheng as she asked, “What do you want to do?!”</p> 
 <p>Jiang Cheng held onto his cheek and slowly stood up before faintly replying, “I just heard some shouts coming from your room, so I came to check. It seems that you’ve been having nightmares.”</p> 
 <p>When Jiang Cheng said these words his tone didn’t carry any hints of anger but sounded very calm instead.</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao was gasping at this moment, and at the thought of the scenario she’d seen in her dream, she felt fear bubble up in her heart at an alarming rate and nearly consume her. She was entirely soaked in cold sweat.</p> 
 <p>After a while, Lan Jinyao lay down again and wrapped herself with the warm quilt before coldly stating, “I’m going back to sleep now, please go out.”</p> 
 <p>However, Jiang Cheng didn’t leave. He stood by the bedside and asked in a soft voice, “You were having nightmares just now; what did you dream about? I kept hearing you shout…‘save me’.”</p> 
 <p>“Do you really want to know?” Lan Jinyao suddenly opened her eyes and glared at him fiercely as she continued, “Then, let me tell you! I dreamed that I was dead and you were the one who caused my death! Now you know why I called for help.”</p> 
 <p>Upon hearing this, there was a slight change in Jiang Cheng’s expression. He took a few steps back and stared at Lan Jinyao with an astounded look on his face. “How could I possibly cause your death?”</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao couldn’t help but chuckle. “Why not? You were the one who killed my child, so if I upset you, I suspect that one day you’d get rid of me without the slightest bit of hesitation! I heard that people who have deep obsessions are all mentally ill, so how difficult could it be for them to kill someone?”</p> 
 <p>After saying this, Lan Jinyao closed her eyes again. Her emotions were fluctuating too much, and this wasn’t a good omen because if she continued like this, she’d lose her rationality and she’d be easier to control when that happened. She didn’t want Jiang Cheng to have her in the palm of his hand.</p> 
 <p>Jiang Cheng, on the other hand, didn’t speak and the bedroom fell into dead silence.</p> 
 <p>After what felt like an eternity, Lan Jinyao heard Jiang Cheng’s footsteps as he left the room and closed the door behind him.</p> 
 <p>At this moment, the corner of her lips curved up into a sneer.</p> 
 <p>“Jiang Cheng, do you want to live in pain, or you want to die immersed in tenderness?” Lan Jinyao’s murmur echoed in the quiet room.</p> 
 <p>The next day, Jiang Cheng acted as if nothing had happened. He was sitting at the dining table when Lan Jinyao walked over and sat down. He just smiled at her with a gentle look in his eyes, without even a trace of ill-feeling.</p> 
 <p>Jiang Cheng tactfully passed her his breakfast and then took her portion.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t worry; I didn’t poison it,” Jiang Cheng smilingly said.</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao looked up at him, and the corners of her lips curved upwards as she sneered, “Would it matter if you added poison or not? What else can you take away from me but my life?”</p> 
 <p>As soon as she finished speaking, she started digging in. <em>She’d already lost her child, so was there still a need for her to worry about Jiang Cheng drugging her?</em></p> 
 <p><em>Would the Jiang family feel any shame after getting to know of all the things that Jiang Cheng had done?</em></p> 
 <p>After breakfast, Lan Jinyao wiped her mouth and said, “Jiang Cheng, I want to go out today.”</p> 
 <p>Without a second thought, Jiang Cheng immediately declined her request with a ‘no’. Afterwards, he realised what he’d said and tried to explain, “There’s currently a lot of gossips about you out there. If you go out now, you’ll undoubtedly attract the media’s attention.”</p> 
 <p>“I’m aware of all the awful things the media is writing about me. But, I won’t get angry because I know that what they wrote is the truth.”</p> 
 <p>Jiang Cheng’s emotions stirred upon hearing this, and he said, “You clearly know that that’s far from the truth.”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Lan Jinyao smiled. “Okay, in that case…I’ll go out today and clear things up.”</p> 
 <p>At this moment, she keenly detected that Jiang Cheng had let out of sigh of relief.</p> 
 <p><em>There was still hope!</em></p> 
 <p>“It would be even better if you could invite some reporters over.”</p> 
 <p>Jiang Cheng’s cloudy expression brightened as he asked, “Are you asking me to help you?”</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao didn’t respond; she simply stood up and walked into the courtyard outside. It had been raining these days, and the weather had finally cleared up today. The air was filled with the scent of some kind of flowers, which could alleviate one’s mood.</p> 
 <p>Jiang Cheng followed her out, and before Lan Jinyao could say another word, he said, “Okay, fine. I’ll help you arrange a press conference.”</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao looked up at the sun in the sky and felt the haziness in her heart vanish completely.</p> 
 <p>Even if Li Qi didn’t convey her words, the reporters would help her express her thoughts to Fu Bainian.</p> 
 <p>In the entertainment industry, reporters loved to add details to their stories before conveying them to the audience. A good piece of news could always be changed beyond recognition in their hands, and today, she wanted precisely this kind of outcome.</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao inwardly thought: <em>Fu Bainian, after you’ve seen the news, you must take care of the danger lurking behind you as soon as possible. I’ll be waiting for you.</em></p>
