<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>After settling the matter with Jiang Baitao, Lan Jinyao reassuringly waited at home for Qingqing, or better said, she was waiting for Shen Wei’an to make an appearance.</p> 
 <p>However, even after waiting for a long time, Qingqing still hadn’t come. After a while, Lan Jinyao could no longer sit still and phoned Li Qi. After she’d stepped down, Li Qi had been assigned by the company to manage another artist. As He Xiaoyun’s current achievements were quite good and Li Qi had specifically requested for her, he was now He Xiaoyun’s Manager.</p> 
 <p>Li Qi, who was working while enjoying the sweetness of love, was seemingly not in a good mood. His phone rang for a long while before he finally answered.</p> 
 <p>“What are you doing now? Don’t tell me that you’re flirting with Xiaoyun again, hmmm?”</p> 
 <p>Li Qi was seemingly running at this moment as he panted and said, “Xiao…Xiaoyun is very busy now; she…she doesn’t even have time to talk to me. I’m currently bringing her the costumes for today’s concert. I just so happened to run into a traffic jam the moment I departed, so unlucky…”</p> 
 <p>“So, you’re now running to deliver the costumes to Xiaoyun?” Lan Jinyao asked, her tone a few octaves higher.</p> 
 <p>It seemed that Li Qi had truly devoted himself to Xiaoyun. Back then, when Li Qi was still her Manager, Xiaolin had to do all those things for her. When he’d had to take a few extra steps, he would rely on his car. <em>What a difference in treatment!</em></p> 
 <p>“Then go ahead and keep going! I’ll call you again when you're free.”</p> 
 <p>“No, wait!” Li Qi stopped her and hurriedly added, “You’ve been resting for a while already, and it’s quite rare for me to receive a call from you. If you have something to say then just say it; I’m all ears. If President Fu were to find out that I’m favouring one over the other, he would certainly tear me to shreds!”</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao was amused by his words.</p> 
 <p>“Nah, stop scaring yourself, it’s not that serious! What I wanted to say isn’t that pressing, I simply wanted to ask if there have been any movements on Qingqing’s side lately.”</p> 
 <p>Li Qi suspiciously asked, “Qingqing? There’s seemingly been no movements thus far. Although it is stated on her business card that she’s also someone from the entertainment industry, she rarely shows her face, so I don’t think that’s the case. She doesn’t seem to care about her connections at all. In any case, as far as I know, she didn’t show up much.”</p> 
 <p><em>Of course she needn’t worry about her connections, there was Jiang Baitao backing her up, and him alone was equivalent to almost half of the entertainment industry.</em></p> 
 <p><em>Unfortunately, she would be abandoned by Jiang Baitao soon.</em></p> 
 <p>“Li Qi, don’t just flirt around; remember to keep an eye on that woman for me.”</p> 
 <p>“No problem! Let’s talk about it next time. I’m off to send the costumes to Xiaoyun. I won’t make it in time if I continue dawdling like this.”</p> 
 <p>Li Qi immediately hung up after speaking, without waiting for her response.</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao stared at her phone and shook her head. She then lay down on the sofa in the living room, unceasingly consoling herself: <em>Don’t get anxious and be patient. Once Qingqing is driven into a corner, you’ll be able to reel in the net.</em></p> 
 <p>Although she told herself that, she still couldn’t help but call Chen Meile in the afternoon, asking her if there were any movements on Qingqing’s side. However, the answer she got was the same as Li Qi’s. Qingqing had rarely made an appearance in the past few days; she didn’t even visit Old Chen.</p> 
 <p>Chen Meile also said that she found it weird that Qingqing wasn’t doing anything, and that she was just about to call her to ask about this.</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao later thought: <em>It should be about time to reel in the net.</em></p> 
 <p>In the evening, Lan Jinyao went to the bar where He Xiaoyun used to work because after she’d finished her call with Chen Meile, she received another call from Qingqing. She didn’t store Qingqing’s number, so the moment the call was connected, she was somewhat stunned to hear Shen Wei’an’s voice.</p> 
 <p>Qingqing was already at the crowded bar, waiting for her.</p> 
 <p><em>That woman’s back really resembled that of Shen Wei’an’s.</em> Lan Jinyao’s expression darkened as she approached her.</p> 
 <p>“Chen Meimei, you’re finally here!”</p> 
 <p>Seeing Lan Jinyao’s approaching figure, Qingqing beamed at her. It was a smile that Shen Wei’an had never shown before. It was an innocent, carefree smile, befitting Chen Meimei’s casual personality.</p> 
 <p>Qingqing pointed at a glass placed on the counter, which was already filled with a brown-coloured liquor. At a glance, Lan Jinyao already knew that the liquor was quite strong.</p> 
 <p>As soon as Lan Jinyao sat down, Qingqing asked, “Why aren’t you drinking?”</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao stared at the glass that had been prepared beforehand, and didn’t say anything. Lan Jinyao didn’t move even under Qingqing’s watchful eye. <em>Suddenly asking her out like this…Qingqing was obviously plotting something, so she had to stay alert and guard against her.</em></p> 
 <p>Even if she were to drink something, she wouldn’t drink this and rather, she’d order another drink herself. Not to mention, she wasn’t planning to touch that at all.</p> 
 <p>“You don’t dare to drink it? What, are you worried about me drugging you?” Qingqing sneered sarcastically.</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao faintly replied, “That’s right, I know what scheme you’re cooking up, so I honestly think that you might drug me with this.” It wasn’t like she hadn’t done this before. Her psychological tactics were of no use against her.</p> 
 <p>“Haha…” Qingqing laughed.</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao then straightforwardly asked, “Why did you want to meet with me today?”</p> 
 <p>As far as she knew, Shen Wei’an was a very impatient person. If she knew how to precipitate, she might’ve already been a very rich and powerful person. After all, she had Jiang Baitao backing her up. But, unexpectedly, this woman was far too ambitious.</p> 
 <p>Since Qingqing had asked her out today, that meant that she hadn’t been driven into a corner yet.</p> 
 <p>“Chen Meimei, I’m telling you, your Old Man will soon become mine, and aside from Fu Bainian, you’ll be left with nothing.”</p> 
 <p>It turned out that Qingqing had asked her out to show off her might.</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao’s lips curled up into a slight smile as she said, “Are you sure that I’ll be left with nothing, and not you? Your identity is fake, right? As far as I know, your current identity doesn’t exist…do you need me to go to the Public Security Bureau to file a case on your behalf?”</p> 
 <p>Hearing this, Qingqing’s complexion paled severed degrees, and she stared daggers at her.</p> 
 <p>Lan Jinyao didn’t stop, and added, “Besides Old Chen, what other bargaining chips do you hold in your hands to fight against me? From what I’ve heard, Jiang Baitao isn’t going to help you anymore!”</p> 
 <p>“Do you know why? Because…I’m the one intercepting you guys!” Lan Jinyao paused, and then complacently continued, “You must’ve guessed this, right?!”</p> 
 <p>At this instant, Qingqing’s expression turned a few shades uglier and she looked much more ferocious than before.</p> 
 <p>She then abruptly grabbed the glass placed on the counter and splashed the liquid inside towards Lan Jinyao. The latter hurriedly stepped aside and dodged it.</p> 
 <p>“Qingqing, what are you doing?! I dare say that I can let you end up at the police station right this instant!”</p> 
 <p>Qingqing glared at Lan Jinyao ferociously for a second, and then grabbed her bag before scurrying away.</p>
