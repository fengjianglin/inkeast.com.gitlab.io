 <p>Chapter 25 - Yesterday's Enemy (4)</p>
 <p><span style>The fire made by Artpe was very warm. &nbsp;The two of them caught fishes from the ravine, and they cooked it over the fire. &nbsp;They used 3 silver worth of salt. &nbsp;Maetel hadn’t had any fish for over a year, so she was surprised by the sudden and unexpected taste.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heeng. &nbsp;This is so tasty…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you eat when you are hungry, everything tastes great .”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were still traces of tear left near Maetel’s eyes. &nbsp;Still, she was briskly eating the fishes. She was even eating the bones. &nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t help but smile. &nbsp;He started to eat his own portion of fishes as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have worked hard, Maetel. &nbsp;It is true that the Dungeon was very hard, but as a result, we were able to significantly decrease our growth period. &nbsp;We’ll be able to move with a little bit more time to spare. &nbsp;No, even if you don’t like it, we’ll move at a more leisurely pace. &nbsp;I’m really tired and exhausted.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Artpe…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Say it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel was still unable to calm her heart. &nbsp;She sniffed as she asked him a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you really sure that you don’t like older women?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“..........”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was she still worried about that!? </span></p>
 <p><span style>He was dumbfounded. &nbsp;He smirked as he shook his head from side to side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn’t I tell you earlier? &nbsp;I gave her a little bit of a warning as recompense for the gem we received.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you really sure?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m really sure.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......yes, I’ll believe you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed her worry about Artpe looking at other women overshadowed her psychological uneasiness at killing humans. &nbsp;It seemed Artpe wouldn’t have to worry too much about her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe let out a sigh of relief, and he was about to clear away the trash. However, at that moment, Maetel spoke as if she just had an idea.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to sleep next to Artpe.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You aren’t a child anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to sleep with you. &nbsp;You said you’ll grant me any wish I want.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel’s voice was shaking slightly. &nbsp;When he heard it, Artpe realized he was under a misconception.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She wasn’t being unnecessarily clingy towards Artpe. &nbsp;Her mental state was uneasy. &nbsp;Moreover, she was still worried about the thought of Artpe leaving her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“....all right. &nbsp;I did say that I’ll grant you a wish, so it can’t be helped.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ya-ho!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He took out a bedroll(5 silvers). &nbsp;It was a bit cramped for two people, but he was prepared to go through with it tonight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He gathered some leaves on the ground, and he placed a cloth over it. &nbsp;Then he placed the bedroll on top before he lie within it. &nbsp;As if she was worried about Artpe going back on his words, she quickly got in. &nbsp;She had a satisfied expression on her face as she closed her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good night, Artpe.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s cramped and uncomfortable in here, so how can we sleep well…. &nbsp;She is already asleep.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ssss······.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Maetel was held by Artpe, it seemed all her worries were let go. &nbsp;She was breathing easily as she quickly fell into sleep. &nbsp;Artpe was dumbfounded by the sight, but in the end, he let out a bitter laugh as he moved to put her in a more comfortable position.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It feels like I’m raising a kid.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In truth, it may not be too far from the truth. &nbsp;Maetel didn’t remember her past life, so she was just a young 13 year old girl. &nbsp;If Artpe added in his past life, he had lived for couple hundred years. &nbsp;He was a demon that was turned into a hero. &nbsp;Sometimes, he felt the disparity between the two lives keenly, and in those moments, he had a hard time breathing. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, Artpe liked being with Maetel. &nbsp;It was strange, but at times, he felt pleased and full.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t just because she was a talent, who could free Artpe by defeating the Demon King. &nbsp;At this point, Artpe had no choice but to accept the fact. &nbsp;&nbsp;Maetel was fairly…. &nbsp;She was quite dear to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was unfortunate that the innocent child was changing. &nbsp;She was being stained by his presence. &nbsp;However, he was thankful that this small child cherished him, and she wanted him around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as if he had committed a sin. &nbsp;It felt as if he was slowly being buried under a soft marsh. &nbsp;It was as if he was melting away. &nbsp;He was afraid to struggle… &nbsp;It was that sweet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Still, I shouldn’t pay too much attention to it. &nbsp;I can be complacent after we kill the Demon King..’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes, he had things to do right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe was careful not to wake Maetel. &nbsp;He carefully snuck his hand out of the bedroll, and he activated his magic. &nbsp;The Hero’s Unique Spell called Mana String was activated in no time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kook!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We were found…..!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The five strands of Mana Strings extended out into the surrounding. &nbsp;The Mana Strings let out a black light as they danced in the air. &nbsp;Red lines of blood bloomed underneath the dark night sky like flowers. &nbsp;&nbsp;Accompanying dull thudding sounds, human body parts started to fall to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had been sure that they had succeeded in their stealth mission. &nbsp;They paid for this belief with their lives. &nbsp;Of course, there were still a lot of them left. &nbsp;Artpe would extract a price from all of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe looked at them with cool eyes, and he spoke with a voice that was colder than a block of ice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She’s sleeping. &nbsp;Be quiet, so she doesn’t wake up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you to playing games with...kahk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe clicked his tongue as he watched the men emerge from the darkness. &nbsp;He moved his fingers. &nbsp;The Mana Strings moved according to his will. &nbsp;They moved like whips with sentience, and they split through the air. &nbsp;The lives of two to three people were killed in a flash.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He is stronger than the girl….!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems you guys are incapable of learning. &nbsp;Don’t you guys realize that you guys are dying in the order of who opened their mouth first?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe’s purple eyes let out a radiant light within the darkness. &nbsp;It was as if his eyes could pierce through all lies. &nbsp;His eyes only contained the truth. &nbsp;The party of men had tried a surprise attack relying on the darkness. &nbsp;His eyes was like the deliverer of death for these men.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W...we can’t win.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The one that is terrifying is actually him…. &nbsp;Kahk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Mana String. &nbsp;The experience I picked up struggling as a weakling was mixed with the Hero’s power to become a Unique spell….’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t a proper spell. &nbsp;The Mana Threads was something he developed during the rough patches of his life as a demon. &nbsp;In the beginning , the Mana String was an unwelcome development for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he was able to quietly take care of this problem thanks to this spell. &nbsp;He was able to let Maetel sleep peacefully. &nbsp;This single reason was good enough for him to value this magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We erred in assessing their capability…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where are you running away?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mana String was able to impart overwhelming force using Mana, but it consumed a lot of Mana. This was why it wasn’t a weapon that could be used freely in a battle situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was why Artpe used all the information coming in through his eyes to find the most efficient trajectories. &nbsp;He moved his fingers according to the calculations he had made.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The men tried everything to stop it, but their weapons and feet were slower than the Mana String, which had no weight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait a moment. &nbsp;If you cooperate with us, you will have a place in the newly created kingdom…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good bye.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The five strands of Mana Strings gathered at a single location. &nbsp;The last remaining man was still struggling to live. &nbsp;He died as he was cut into several slabs of meat. &nbsp;His face was full of resentment. &nbsp;Artpe let out a bitter laugh when he saw it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘From your perspective, your side was probably in the absolute right. &nbsp;In your next life, I hope you will be able to live a life as a farmer where you won’t have to kill or be killed. &nbsp;I will pray for you all.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe retracted the Mana Strings, and he checked Maetel, who was snuggled up against him. &nbsp;Her breathing was even. &nbsp;She was still asleep.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘That wasn’t too bad.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it seemed the disturbance wasn’t at an end. &nbsp;From not too far away, the main guests were coming towards them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We were discovered, captain! &nbsp;If you are done retrieving the gem, you should help…. &nbsp;What!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the beginning, Artpe hadn’t bothered hiding his location. &nbsp;He didn’t have any particular difficulty in dispatching the first group that had ambushed him, and it would be the same for those that had followed behind them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What the hell is…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Impossible…..!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had wondered about the identity of the second group, who was drawn towards them like &nbsp;moths. &nbsp;It was none other than the knights that had accompanied the crown prince Silpennon. There were some amongst them that was suffering from serious wounds. &nbsp;Some amongst them had bloated face as if they were suffering under the effects of poison.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, they were better off than the men that were killed here. &nbsp;They had come here to ask for help, so they hadn’t expected to witness the death of their other party. &nbsp;They were extremely surprised.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Y….you bastard!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe was wide awake, while Maetel was asleep. &nbsp;It wasn’t too difficult to determine, who was the culprit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You guys are too noisy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe only brought out a single strand of Mana String to confront their anger. &nbsp;&nbsp;These men were like scraps compared to the men that had ambushed Artpe’s party. &nbsp;They were maggots, who ran away, because they couldn’t handle a single level 118 knight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Be quiet. &nbsp;Forever.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuhk…..!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Mana String cut through the air. &nbsp;Four knights had survived, and they had run away towards this direction. &nbsp;He took care of them in six seconds. &nbsp;Afterwards, a woman ran into the clearing. &nbsp;She had great timing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You bastards! &nbsp;You dare to call yourselves knights, who protect the royal family…. &nbsp;&nbsp;Mmmm!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shhh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe was still within the bedroll, and he was glaring at the female knight Leseti with narrowed eyes. &nbsp;Leseti saw the numerous corpses strewn around the clearing, so she closed her mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was pretty good on the uptake, so she was able to easily identify, who was behind the slaughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I had a hunch that he wasn’t normal, but I never expected him to be such an overwhelming force. &nbsp;Who is this young man…. &nbsp;&nbsp;Mmm?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was so scared that she was unable to let out even a squeak under Artpe’s murderous gaze. &nbsp;She silently went over the situation when she suddenly had an epiphany.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was an incident near here only a year ago. &nbsp;Two heroes had been born in a country village. &nbsp;When they disappeared, the whole kingdom had been in an uproar!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two youths....</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were incomprehensibly strong compared to their ages.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black hair and blonde hair….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmmm, Artpe…...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leseti couldn’t hold back her exclamation of surprise. &nbsp;Maetel opened her eyes. &nbsp;Leseti belatedly realized she had made a mistake. &nbsp;Artpe sharply raised a finger, and Leseti shut her eyes when she saw it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A brief amount of time had passed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you ok, Artpe?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I wasn’t hurt at all, so you don’t have to touch me constantly. &nbsp;I’ll clean this up, so you should keep your eyes close.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'm not going to close my eyes. &nbsp;I’m all right now. &nbsp;I’ll be fine since Artpe is here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t look fine…. &nbsp;All right. &nbsp;You do whatever you want.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If she hadn’t seen the corpses everywhere around her, she would have been able to continue her sleep. &nbsp;However, once she found about about them, sleep wasn’t an option. &nbsp;The two heroes got up from their sleeping place, and they put away the bedroll. &nbsp;They started working on cleaning up the corpses strewn about their surrounding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe took all of the equipment that was useful. &nbsp;He also took all the silver coins they possessed. &nbsp;Maetel gathered the corpses he was done ‘looting.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Artpe, why do we have to kill other people?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is the same reason as to why we killed the monsters. &nbsp;We all have something we want from each other. &nbsp;Everything else is just an excuse. &nbsp;The plethora of excuses given for harming living beings are just embellishments.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see….. &nbsp;&nbsp;The act of living is very hard in itself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The important part is to realize that we have to live within such a world. &nbsp;You can respect the lives of other people, but when there is a collision, you have carry through to enforce your way of life.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. &nbsp;All right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thirteen year old brats were talking about philosophical bullshit as they calmly cleared away the corpses. &nbsp;What was she supposed to say to them? &nbsp;Should she disagree with their views? &nbsp;Should she tell them to go read more books?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, Leseti was banned from speaking, so she didn’t say anything. &nbsp;She continued to raise her two hands as she sat on her knees. &nbsp;This was a punishment devised by Artpe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That it. &nbsp;Did you gather all of them Maetel?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Artpe threw all the corpses into the fire, he turned to look at Leseti. &nbsp;She still had her arms up as she carried out the order she was given. &nbsp;Artpe smirked as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your punishment is at an end. &nbsp;You should go back to the crown prince. &nbsp;As you probably realize by now, no one will side with you even if you head back towards the palace. &nbsp;The two of you should go to a remote village. &nbsp;You should live a quiet life, while tending to cows.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Koohk…...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leseti couldn’t give a proper retort. &nbsp;She just groaned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes, the only thing going for the crown prince was that he was the legitimate heir. &nbsp;However, in regards to all other issues, the rebels held the upper hand. &nbsp;No one would side with them. &nbsp;That was the miserable truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>”Hey”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, a young man pushed past the brush, and he gave a reply instead of Leseti.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you know why there was a rebellion against the Diaz family?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the red haired crown prince Silpennon. &nbsp;Of course, Artpe had already sensed him getting close. &nbsp;This was why he wasn’t surprised as he gave his reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did they perhaps attack the king on the fact that he wasn’t able to properly take care of the heroes?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are correct. &nbsp;Of course, I don’t plan on putting the blame on you guys. &nbsp;That incident was merely the trigger. &nbsp;My uncle…. &nbsp;The duke was a wild beast, who had been waiting for an opportunity to tear into the king. &nbsp;If it wasn’t the escape of the heroes, he would have found another reason to start a rebellion”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Silpennon had already come to the same conclusion as Leseti that Artpe and Maetel were heroes. Still, his face remained aloof. &nbsp;It was said that a man grows through hardship. &nbsp;His gaze remained on Artpe instead of Maetel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are right. &nbsp;Even if I recklessly went back to the palace, there isn’t much that I could do. &nbsp;I’m just a brat that was lucky enough to be born as the crown prince. &nbsp;If I act rashly, my head would be severed. &nbsp;It would be mounted next to the king’s head.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your highness…..!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is why I have to go with you guys.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His words were very unexpected. &nbsp;However, Silpennon continued to speak with a sincere voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The duke rebelled using the fact that my father had lost track of the heroes. &nbsp;The duke used that reason to gain the throne. &nbsp;Now he will use all available resources to find the heroes in an attempt to solidify his reign.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’ll seems likely.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So what would happen if I’m already in the party of the heroes?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was this bastard talking about?</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Artpe glared at Silpennon, he provided an explanation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The new king would be unable to find the heroes, yet I would be in the party of the heroes. &nbsp;I would be helping the the heroes. &nbsp;In the end, we would succeed in killing the Demon King! &nbsp;At that time, who would the people and the nobles want on the throne! &nbsp;They would want me, who gained the title of hero!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh oh. It is a very risky and wild plan! &nbsp;Still, it isn’t too bad.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t it!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a good idea considering it was devised by a kid. &nbsp;This stupid kingdom put importance on titles compared to any other place in the world. &nbsp;This plan sounded like it could actually work!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe nodded his head as if there was merit to his plan. &nbsp;Silpennon was excited by this fact, so he started shouting his words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That is why you guys should team up with me! &nbsp;From this moment on, I’ll throw away my rank as the crown prince. &nbsp;I’ll help you guys defeat the Demon King. &nbsp;I’ll become a key player within the hero’s party!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hold your horses. &nbsp;There is a very big flaw within your plan that can’t be ignored.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe spoke coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are too weak. &nbsp;You won’t be of any help to us. &nbsp;I’ll be blunt. &nbsp;You’ll be a burden, so get lost.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Koo-huhk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The astute comment was a critical hit! &nbsp;The crown prince had no way of refuting that fact! &nbsp;The current hero’s words had a multiplier effect!</span></p>
