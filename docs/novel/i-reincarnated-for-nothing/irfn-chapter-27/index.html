<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Chapter 27 - Dungeon, Evolution and Success</p>
 <p><span style>In Artpe’s past life, the hero’s party was the first to explore the Slime Dungeon first. &nbsp;Afterwards, the Dungeon became popular amongst the adventurers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>First, the Dungeon produced only Slimes. &nbsp;This was why the danger to the adventurers was very low, and there weren’t that many traps present. &nbsp;Moreover, when one killed a certain amount of Slimes, random treasure chests appeared when the Mana within the Dungeon was activated. &nbsp;This was why one could expect a decent amount of profit in this Dungeon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Basically, this is the best place for a beginner adventurer to grow. &nbsp;Moreover, it is also a great place to learn about Dungeons.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So why are there so many Slimes-ahhhhhhhhk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk. &nbsp;He looked like he was going to die, yet he isn’t dying.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who was it right now! &nbsp;Who clicked their tongue at me-ahhhhhhk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Silpennon was fighting hard. &nbsp;Normally, a talent bloomed the brightest in brutal situations rather than a relaxed surrounding. &nbsp;A single misstep would allow the group of Slimes to swallow him, and he would be digested by them. &nbsp;This was why he was squeezing out his abilities, and he was able to push himself past his limit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the two daggers danced in the air, the severed portion of the Slimes were sent flying. &nbsp;Silpennon’s battle capability was increasing in real-time. &nbsp;As expected, a genius was a genius.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems one doesn’t need a coach in battle.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that so? &nbsp;Why is he moving like that? &nbsp;I have questions….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can’t use yourself as the standard, Maetel. &nbsp;If so, everyone will be disqualified in the preliminaries.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Too many! &nbsp;There are too many of them! &nbsp;Damn Slimes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Slime Dungeon was different in many ways to the first Dungeon entered by Artpe and Maetel. &nbsp;The previous Dungeon had a limit as to how many monsters could form. &nbsp;This Dungeon created new monsters every time it had any spare Mana.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It didn’t matter how many monsters were still left within. &nbsp;It spawned them as if it wanted to make the monsters explode out from the Dungeon!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The monsters spawned within the Dungeon was influenced by the Record and the Mana. &nbsp;These components were unique to each Dungeon. &nbsp;This was why an adventurer was unable to claim to be an expert after exploring one or two Dungeons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That is why the rooms are infested with Slimes. &nbsp;Well, the Slimes are activating all the traps, so at the very least, we don’t have to worry about him dying from the traps.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is all thanks to the Slimes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ooh-ohhhhhhhhhhhh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Silpennon frantically swung the daggers in each hand as he cut into the Slimes. &nbsp;His Dual Wielding had evolved into level 2. &nbsp;His growth couldn’t compare to what Maetel went through when she fought monsters for her first time in a Dungeon. &nbsp;Still, he wasn’t too bad.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the Slimes overcame the death of their comrades as they kept coming. &nbsp;Their main objective was to eat Silpennon. &nbsp;The Slimes charged forward without looking back. &nbsp;Inevitably, the stronger ones started to show up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop! &nbsp;Don’t come here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh oh oh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sight reminded Artpe of the time when the combined forces of all the countries on the continent were sent towards the Demon King’s army. &nbsp;If a hundred of such group continued to come at him, Silpennon would succumb to them eventually!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eeeek. &nbsp;Help me before I fall!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll bury you in a sunny place, your highness.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How can you call yourself a guardian knight! &nbsp;You're fired! &nbsp;Ooh-gahhhhhhhh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Silpennon’s struggle continued. &nbsp;He had been a level 7, but at some point, he had reached level 18. &nbsp;As he moved deeper into the Dungeon, the level of the Slimes continued to creep upwards. However, Silpennon was slowly getting a feel for fighting against a large group, so a good fight ensued.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel tilted her head in confusion as she watched the life and death battle between human and Slimes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Artpe, didn’t the Skeletons retreat when they were at a disadvantage? &nbsp;Why do these monsters continue to charge forward?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Silpennon looks beatable compared to us. &nbsp;These guys are constantly hungry. &nbsp;They’ll keep attacking unless their opponent is stronger than them by a fair amount”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why don’t they eat each other?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The question was very well-timed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Slimes don’t eat those that are from the same race as them. &nbsp;However, it isn't prudent to view monsters through common sense. &nbsp;An exception always exists.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe gave his explanation as he pointed towards Silpennon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Silpennon had just killed a group of Slime, and he was wiping slime off of his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even if they are monsters from the same race, their behavior pattern changes depending on the Dungeon, environmental factors and other variables. &nbsp;Amongst the monsters, the change that the Slime undergoes is very well-defined and simple. &nbsp;Moreover, most Dungeons evolve to match the behavior patterns of the monsters.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So the Dungeons and monsters live and breathe together?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right. &nbsp;Maetel is smart.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hoo-hoot.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a rare praise, so there was a bright smile on Maetel’s face. &nbsp;However, the only ones to laugh in an easygoing manner were the heroes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your explanation makes me feel uneasy…. &nbsp;It is as if you are trying to say our mere presence will cause changes in the behavior pattern of the Slimes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leseti made a pretty sharp observation. When he heard her words, a chill went up Silpennon’s spine. &nbsp;He quickly turned towards Artpe to shout at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to leave this crazy place!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is too late. &nbsp;It has already started.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Artpe finished speaking, an ominous sound of Slimes moving across the floor was heard. &nbsp;The sound was amplified by several degrees.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Slimes…. &nbsp;&nbsp;They are retreating?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It isn’t just the monsters. &nbsp;The Dungeon is really changing…..!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a room at the end of the hallway that had been sealed. &nbsp;The room collapsed. &nbsp;It continued onto the next one and so forth. &nbsp;When a change occured within a Dungeon, the most common phenomenon to occur was the collapse of the strict boundaries that kept the rooms separate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It also meant that the Dungeon was becoming more dangerous, and the monsters would become stronger. &nbsp;In turn, the reward would also be greater. &nbsp;When an adventurer feels the change in the Dungeon, one would have to make a quick decision and act on it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Silpennon had two choices. &nbsp;He could go forward or retreat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As I’ve said before, I’m getting out of here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have to express my regret to you. &nbsp;There are two type of changes that may occur within a Dungeon. &nbsp;There are the Dungeons that allow the adventures to retreat when they desire it. &nbsp;Then there are the ones that allow you to come in easily, but it won’t let you go easily.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe pointed back at the sealed entrance of the Dungeon, and he smirked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This Dungeon is the latter type.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Silpennon’s face crumpled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My god….. &nbsp;Doesn’t this basically impose a death sentence on the adventurers!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you under some kind of delusion? &nbsp;Dungeons aren’t here to help develop adventurers. &nbsp;The Dungeons aren’t here to give them treasures. &nbsp;The Dungeons merely exists. &nbsp;The danger and opportunity is distributed equitably to all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, Artpe’s Read All Creation ability allowed him to see what changes were occurring within the Dungeon. &nbsp;At its heart, this was a Slime Dungeon. &nbsp;Even if it evolved in innovative ways, the only one in danger would be Silpennon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The prerequisites that causes the change in the behavior pattern of the Slimes is very simple. First, the intruders has to be strong enough that the Slime can’t win in a direct confrontation. &nbsp;Secondly, the intruder has to show no signs of retreating. &nbsp;The intruder has to rush forward continuously. &nbsp;Third, there has to be an overwhelming number of Slimes present. &nbsp;When all of these conditions are met, they start eating each other to become stronger.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s what’s happening right now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Silpennon screamed those words out. &nbsp;The Slimes were wriggling around, and they were combining to become larger. &nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the walls of the Dungeon continued to collapse. &nbsp;The Slimes that were on alert within these rooms came forward. &nbsp;They kept rushing towards the Slime that was eating its own brethrens!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh oh. &nbsp;It is rare to see one that can eat so much. &nbsp;If we are lucky, this might ratchet up a level.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In many ways, the current situation was good for them. &nbsp;First, the Slime Dungeon hadn’t been found yet, so a lot of Slimes had amassed within. &nbsp;Their party including Silpennon was overpowered in terms of martial strength(Silpennon would disagree with this point). &nbsp;Then there was the massive amount of Mana in reserve that would allow the Dungeon to make changes alongside the monsters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was how Artpe changed history once again. &nbsp;The Slime Dungeon would never be a beginner’s Dungeon from this point forward. &nbsp;This was the start of a hellhole that was now under the rule of the evolved Slime!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Up a level? &nbsp;What do you mean by up a level? &nbsp;Are you perhaps talking about a high rank Class! &nbsp;Tell me it ain’t so!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It can't be, your highness. &nbsp;As you’ve seen, the Slimes are the lowest ranked monsters that range from level 5 to level 10. &nbsp;The probability of these monsters combining to form a monster over level 50 is…...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah. &nbsp;The Dungeon is collapsing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ooh-ohhhhhhhhhhhh!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once a Slime starts to eat its brethrens, it won’t stop until it’s sure it can eat all of the intruders. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the beginning, Silpennon had driven the Slimes into a frenzy. &nbsp;Moreover, Artpe and the other members of his party was also within the Dungeon. The Slime knew it couldn’t beat them with a single floor worth of Slimes, so it started preying on the Slimes on the next floor. &nbsp;The Dungeon received its intention, and the Dungeon collapsed the floor!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kyahhhhhk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Koohk!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, the adventurers, who had found this Dungeon, fell downwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Artpe!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe swung his hand, and he extended three strands of Mana String. He was at the center as he wrapped Maetel, Leseti and Silpennon with the Mana Strings. &nbsp;They safely landed on the Dungeon’s 2nd floor, which was below the collapsed hallway.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Geeeeeeeeee]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Sss-oooooh, sss-oooooooooh]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m starting to hear something!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh. &nbsp;If we are lucky, it might even gain self-awareness. &nbsp;Ee-yah. &nbsp;There are much more Slimes on the 2nd floor! &nbsp;This is fun! &nbsp;They are all combining!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ya-ho!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you guys come here to have fun!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were only Slimes, but the ones on the 2nd floor was much higher in level than the ones on the 1st floor. &nbsp;The Slimes didn’t care if the ceiling had fallen. &nbsp;They were all over the 2nd floor, and the giant Slime that was formed on the 1st floor started eating the other helpless Slimes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Keeeeeeeeeeee]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh oh. &nbsp;I don’t like it. &nbsp;The color of each Slime is being mixed inside that big Slime, and it is giving me a bad feeling!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How can the color of the Slime change like that, Artpe?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As a matter of fact…...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you have the time to leisurely explain the ecology of a Slime, you should do something about that bastard, Artpe!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As it absorbed new types of Slimes into its body, the giant Slime was dyed with all kinds of colors! &nbsp;The party watched the gluttonous Slime. &nbsp;It was akin to watching someone else’s house burn down. &nbsp;Artpe could see the level of the enormous Slime rise in real time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Big Slime]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Level : 33]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s all right. &nbsp;It is still a lousy monster. &nbsp;Ah. &nbsp;Of course, a single hit will kill you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You should have told me that first!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As if Silpennon had been waiting for such words, he quickly ran towards Leseti. &nbsp;Leseti talked about his grave and funeral, but she didn’t really plan on letting him die. &nbsp;She let him hide behind her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“For your information, it is an Elite monster now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t we get better rewards for killing Elite monsters?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is also stronger than the monsters at the same level.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Big Slime was well aware of its station. &nbsp;It had grown a lot, but it knew it would get cut into pieces by the other humans before it was able to kill the detestable red haired brat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was why it wasn't satisfied. &nbsp;It kept eating all the Slimes on the 2nd floor. &nbsp;In the process, the hidden passages of the Dungeons were revealed, and all kinds of rare Slimes started to pop out. &nbsp;These Slimes were much more colorful. &nbsp;They either possessed a faint trace of magical energy or they were stickier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, they became nutrients that fueled the growth of the Big Slime.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Uh. &nbsp;In the past, I’ve never heard of a rumor about secret passages inside this Dungeon.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, Artpe didn’t search out Dungeons in his past life, so he hadn’t had the chance to use his Read All Creation ability within them. &nbsp;Basically, a secret that had never been found in his previous life was revealed to him in the present.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Well, this was only a Slime Dungeon. &nbsp;There probably wasn’t anything great….</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Goo-ohhhhhh-ohng!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It let out a cry!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s shining!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh. &nbsp;I might have been wrong.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The rare Records that wasn’t usually allowed to be accessed by a normal Slime had been gathered in one place. &nbsp;The Slime broke through another wall, and it took another step forward. &nbsp;The party members saw a very rare sight where a monster reached a high rank class through gaining a high level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Great Slime]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Level : 50]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ee-yah. &nbsp;That one is splendid. &nbsp;It reached the status of an Elite Rare monster!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How long are you going to just watch!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm. You are right. &nbsp;I should start taking action.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe found a good sized rock, and he put a decent amount of Mana into it. &nbsp;He threw it towards a nearby Slime. &nbsp;After the Slime ate the rock, it was absorbed into the Great Slime.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Silpennon cried out suddenly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I told you to take care of it! &nbsp;When did I tell you to feed the Slime!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aigo. &nbsp;It is eating it well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop feeding it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Great Slime continued to evolve. &nbsp;However, the Slimes on the 2nd floor was all gone. &nbsp;Even the secret tunnels were all opened. &nbsp;It meant there wasn’t a single monster left on the 2nd floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah. &nbsp;It is easting the treasure chests.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s all right. &nbsp;It takes a very long time for a Slime to digest objects. &nbsp;We can recover it later after we kill it. &nbsp;If the item can’t last until then, it means it isn’t worth that much!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m asking if you can really kill that thing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah. &nbsp;The 2nd floor is also collapsing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, the Dungeon’s 3rd floor was revealed. &nbsp;They hadn’t moved much, yet they were able to clear the 1st and 2nd floor. &nbsp;It was great, since they didn’t have to waste any calories. &nbsp;He pitied Silpennon, who was wasting all the saved calories by screaming his head off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wa-ah! &nbsp;The 3rd floor also has a lot of secret passageways!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Great Slime’s behavior is set now. &nbsp;It will eat all of its brethrens. &nbsp;The other Slimes on this floor won’t consider us enemies. &nbsp;The Great Slime is there enemy. &nbsp;That is why….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wa!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Great Slime was eating all the Slimes residing on the 3rd floor! &nbsp;While it was doing so, Artpe kept infusing nearby rocks with his Mana. &nbsp;He kept feeding the Slimes inside the Dungeon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How long are you going to just watch it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not sure. &nbsp;Maybe, until all the Slimes coalesces into one?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When will that occur!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s a very good question.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe let out a sweet smile as he answered the question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have no idea!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Slime continued to stuff itself. &nbsp;It continued until they reached the 6th floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In Artpe’s past life, the Slime Dungeon had only been explored to the 5th floor.</span></p>
