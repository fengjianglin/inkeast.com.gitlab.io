 <p>Chapter 15 - The Link Between You and I (3)</p>
 <p><span style>“Hello, adventurers. &nbsp;I was dispatched by the Anywhere company. &nbsp;I am here to help your Dungeon exploration be as smooth and pleasant of an experience as it can be. &nbsp;I am a middleman. &nbsp;My name is Mycenae!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had smooth brown skin, and a notably ample bosom. &nbsp;The beautiful woman’s voice was clear as if a bell was ringing. &nbsp;She waved her hand as she spoke towards Artpe and Maetel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel instinctively pushed Artpe behind her, and she was about to raise her sword. &nbsp;Artpe smirked as he placed his hand on her shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She isn’t an enemy, so don’t worry about it. &nbsp;According to their contract, they aren’t allowed to attack us first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Contract?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is a contract made with the god. &nbsp;It is sometimes called the Dungeon contract. &nbsp;Anyways, it is a contract that no one can break, so you don’t have to worry about it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Artpe even knows about that. &nbsp;You are really amazing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh my. &nbsp;Do you know about the Anywhere company?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She surmised they were out of the ordinary, since the two kids were able to reach the depths of this Dungeon. &nbsp;However, she never expected him to have some general knowledge about her store!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mycenae, who was the middleman from the Anywhere company, looked at Artpe with round eyes. &nbsp;Artpe snorted as he waved his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How dare you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Several dozen Mana threads were emitted from both sides, and they crossed paths. &nbsp;There weren’t any ill-intention behind her use of Mana, but it was indiscriminately broken up as it dissipated. &nbsp;He was able to declare this his words with impudence. &nbsp;All detection and inquiry magic was useless under his Read All Creation ability!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh my!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t you try to get cute with me, merchant.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mycenae realized that her inquiry magic had been denied before it could even activate. &nbsp;She backed away in fright. &nbsp;She backed into the cart, and her bosom jiggled as if it was about to spill out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every man, who had the strength to raise a spoon, would have been instinctively drawn to her charming gesture. &nbsp;However, Artpe just spit on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hoong. &nbsp;You are an ajumma.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W...what did you just say!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You should be prepared to give us a 20% discount, ajumma. &nbsp;If you were able pull it off in secret, it would be fine. &nbsp;However, you have no excuse, since I found out. &nbsp;Right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kook······!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had been a middleman for the Anywhere company for the past 100 years. &nbsp;She was a veteran of this industry. &nbsp;She never expected to be humiliated in her first meeting with this brat! &nbsp;Mycenae balled up her fist as they trembled. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe turned his gaze away from her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His gaze reached the two Skeletons, who had been enhanced to the extreme. &nbsp;Only pile of bone dusts was left behind as remains.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All right. &nbsp;Let’s do our looting first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh, customer?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ll trade with you. &nbsp;Just wait there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if she set aside the brusque little man, the girl had completely ignored her. &nbsp;She felt a large crack form in her pride.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Who the hell were they! &nbsp;Unlike their appearances, why were they giving off a vibe of 20 year veteran Dungeon explorers!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There really is only powders left behind. &nbsp;Still, it isn’t as if there are no other way to….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I tried to loot, but it didn’t work. &nbsp;What should I do in such a situation, Artpe?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All right. &nbsp;I’ll teach it to you, so you should pay close attention.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even as Mycenae's body shook, Artpe approached the two pile of bone dusts, and he extended his Mana Threads in abundance. &nbsp;Maetel stood by his side, and her head was tilted in confusion. &nbsp;He gave a friendly explanation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, it does seem impossible to loot a monster that had been completely pulverized, but this isn’t the case if you have the ability to control Mana. &nbsp;Watch me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mana Threads extended out of his hand, and they reached the two piles of bone dusts made out of two Skeletons. &nbsp;The piles reacted to the Mana Threads, and it started to clump into a single pile. &nbsp;Artpe moved his hand in various directions, and the process accelerated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Next, you have to do this….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he severed the Mana Threads, the debris also stopped moving. &nbsp;It looked like a pile of ash. &nbsp;It was as if a vampire had been burned to death there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We just have to wait for the chosen items to come out. &nbsp;This is an easy method you can use if you acted rashly by burning remains of a monster. &nbsp;You should keep that in mind.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As expected, Artpe is amazing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“These customers are…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This Dungeon had been appealing enough to call her forth. &nbsp;The fact that these young adventurers were able to last inside this place was surprising, but it was much more surprising to see one of them use such advanced technique to loot the monsters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Mycenae was gawking at them, the looting process was coming to a end. &nbsp;It looked to be successful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, Artpe. &nbsp;Something is emerging.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is an arm warmer. &nbsp;Since you have the gauntlets, this one is mine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow. &nbsp;A pretty crystal also came out!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There were too much excess magical energy from monsters gathered here. &nbsp;Since it couldn’t be collected naturally, it clumped together. &nbsp;Normally, it is used as ingredient for making magical tools. &nbsp;Mmmm. &nbsp;&nbsp;This isn’t an item that you can use…....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Artpe can have it all. &nbsp;I have the sword and the armor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mmm. &nbsp;She was like an unwavering angel. &nbsp;Artpe let out a bitter laugh as he put the crystal away. &nbsp;Then he put on the arm warmers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was unknown as to why arm warmers made out of black leather was dropped by a Skeleton, but when he equipped it, it had a supplemental effect of increasing his hand speed. &nbsp;&nbsp;It wasn’t intentional, but this was the ideal equipment for Artpe, who had to use both his hands for battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can see something still shining there, Artpe.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah. &nbsp;I almost forgot about it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since all the drops of Skeletons on this floor was gathered in one place, there would also be some money mixed inside the loot. &nbsp;&nbsp;He saw two pretty large gold coins. &nbsp;Artpe smirked as he picked them up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I anticipated a gold coin would come out, but I didn’t expect two. &nbsp;Nice.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wahhhhh. &nbsp;They are pretty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the first time Maetel had seen gold coins in her lifetime. &nbsp;Her eyes twinkled as she let out an exclamation. &nbsp;A gold coin was worth 100 times more than a silver coin. &nbsp;This wasn’t something unique to Maetel. &nbsp;Even their town’s chief would never be able to possess one in his lifetime.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Normally, not all monsters over level 100 drop gold coins. &nbsp;This miraculous event occurred, because all our enemies were tied together by the Record Link. &nbsp;You should keep that in mind.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All right!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait a moment, customer. &nbsp;Record Link? &nbsp;What is that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if she was a veteran middleman for the Dungeons, this didn’t mean she knew everything about ancient magic. &nbsp;Of course, Artpe didn’t answer the merchant’s question. &nbsp;He finished his looting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We didn’t gain any rewards that we can liquidate…. &nbsp;Still, if we add the gold coins to the money we already have, I might be able manage a decent trade.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait a moment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Artpe made sure there weren’t anything else he could take, he walked towards the Dungeon merchant he had been ignoring up until now. &nbsp;He moved towards Mycenae. &nbsp;Mycenae acted as if she had forgotten about the affront of being ignored up until now. &nbsp;She greeted him with a bright smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Welcome, customer. &nbsp;Are you looking for a specific item?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“One empty bottle”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Y…you want an empty bottle?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mycenae and Artpe made eye contact. &nbsp;She tried her best to discern Artpe’s inner thoughts, but he kept a sickeningly innocent expression on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She knew he was up to something. &nbsp;However, a member of the Anywhere company couldn’t turn down a trade unless there was a special circumstance involved! &nbsp;It was the biggest taboo to turn down a trade! &nbsp;Mycenae felt uneasy as she took out an empty bottle from her cart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The price is 50 bronze coins.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is only a single empty bottle! &nbsp;Why is it so expensive!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All Dungeon merchants are like this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe ignored Maetel, who was shocked. &nbsp;He took the empty bottle. &nbsp;Mycenae watched Artpe unstopper the bottle. &nbsp;She spoke with a worried tone in her voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems you are trying to fill up the bottle with the water from the fountain. &nbsp;Shouldn’t you check if the water is safe to drink first? &nbsp;It is a fundamental rule followed by all adventurers.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know. &nbsp;I already checked it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You already checked it!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It originates in my heart to manifest in the shallow floor of the water. &nbsp;Peel off your despicable outer layer to reveal what lies inside!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W...what the hell!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>While the middleman Mycenae expressed her dismay, Artpe finished his chant. &nbsp;It caused an enormous amount of friction to form at the middle of the fountain!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wa-ha-ha-ha. &nbsp;The water is boiling!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right. &nbsp;I’m wastefully using my Mana!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Hyper Rubbing spell was causing so much friction that it was vaporizing the cold water. &nbsp;He was now over level 40, and he was getting used to forming the Hyper Rubbing spell. &nbsp;The effectiveness of the magic was on a different level compared to before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kyahhhhk, customer. &nbsp;If the water holds poison, it’ll turn into a poisonous fog!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I already checked it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The steam covered them completely, but there was no poison within it. &nbsp;There were some poison that dissolved entirely in water, and it could have been vaporized alongside the water. &nbsp;On the other hand, there were poisons that didn’t mix with the water. &nbsp;It would be left behind in place as sediment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, the poison within the fountain was the latter type. &nbsp;This was why Artpe didn’t hesitate to evaporate the water.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is the first time I’ve heard of such a spell. &nbsp;If you wanted to boil the water, couldn’t you have just used a fire type magic?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I did it, because I don’t have such magic!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m currently selling the Boil spell for two gold. &nbsp;The fire spell is being sold at a great price of 1 gold!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won’t buy it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were a lot of water inside the fountain, so it took a good amount of time for all of it to evaporate. &nbsp;After a long wait, the result came to fruition. &nbsp;The copious amount of water inside the water fountain had all evaporated, and on the floor, a dark green powder was left behind in a lump.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmph.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe smirked when he saw Mycenae unconsciously let out a moan. &nbsp;He put the powder into the empty bottle. &nbsp;Of course, the identity of the powder was a form of poison. &nbsp;It was fine to touch it with one’s bare hands. &nbsp;Its toxicity appeared only when it was mixed with a liquid, so it was safe to touch it right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, are you going to buy this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe didn’t leave a single grain of the green powder behind. &nbsp;He stoppered the bottle, and he pushed it towards Mycenae. &nbsp;Her cheeks were puffed up as she started to argue with Artpe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.......so you already know why the Dungeon Merchants appear in Dungeons?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course. &nbsp;You guys have designs on acquiring magical goods.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When adventurers explore a Dungeon, they face danger and opportunity prepared by the Dungeon. &nbsp;One might find a hidden treasure box, a poisoned fountain or a pond made out of the highest quality holy water.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was possible for the Dungeon Merchants to detect the energies of these treasures, and they appeared randomly in these Dungeons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If an adventurer was unable to find the treasures, the Dungeon Merchants acquired the rights to take the unfound treasures. &nbsp;Around half the population considered to be adventurers were poor at detecting treasures on each floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if an adventurer knew why a Dungeon Merchant had appeared, the adventurer wouldn’t be able to find the treasure unless they were very skilled. &nbsp;An adventurer could search the entirety of the Dungeon for treasures just based on the fact that a Dungeon Merchant had appeared, but the chance of finding the treasure was close to zero.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, Artpe was an anomaly. &nbsp;Even before the Dungeon Merchant had appeared, he knew what was waiting for him at the end of the 6th floor. &nbsp;He had located everything, so there was nothing else to say. &nbsp;He grinned as he shook the bottle containing the green powder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So you aren’t going to buy it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mycenae’s expression crumpled in distress, but her instinct as a merchant was soon brought to the fore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Koo-oohk…. &nbsp;&nbsp;I’ll buy it for 2 gold.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All right. &nbsp;I hope you meet a pushover next time, who will be easily deceived by you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe turned around without hesitation, and Mycenae desperately reached out towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'll give you 4 gold! &nbsp;You have to factor in the processing cost! &nbsp;The processing cost!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I made sure there wasn’t a single drop of water remained. &nbsp;What processing fee? &nbsp;Give me 10 gold.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are being heavy-handed….!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you don't’ buy it for 10 gold, there will be no trade.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe was firm. &nbsp;He was so resolute that it made one wonder if the creator, who made the boundaries between ocean and land, spoke in such a way in the past.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mycenae knew that the person in front of her already knew the exact worth of the item within her hand. &nbsp;If so, what choice did she have? &nbsp;She had no choice, but to agree to his demand!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll buy it for 10 gold.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All right. &nbsp;Since you bought the Basilisk Venom Powder for the price of 10 gold, this isn’t a losing proposition for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You even knew the name…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Mycenae decided to treat him like an experienced merchant. &nbsp;When one met a person like him, the fact that she didn’t take a loss was a form of victory!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, she would be able to gather information on a little-known adventurer on this continent. &nbsp;She would be able to gain massive profit from it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Next… &nbsp;I want you to repair our equipments.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Repair… &nbsp;All right. &nbsp;Huh? &nbsp;All your equipment are artifacts, but…. &nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, you guys have pretty bad equipment. &nbsp;Does this mean that your levels are also…..?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I told you not to pry any further.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It cost 50 silvers to repair all the equipment. &nbsp;He paid 40 silvers after receiving the 20% discount.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mycenae never expected him to discount the price of the repair fee, but she also knew she had acted rude in the first place. &nbsp;This was why she couldn’t do anything about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Next, I want boots and helmet for her. &nbsp;I want a robe. &nbsp;I want you to give me your best performing equipment with the lowest level restriction.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have boots and helmet made from the bones of a Blood Ketai. &nbsp;The two items will be worth 8 gold…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since I’m receiving a 20% discount, I’ll give you 6 gold and 30 silver. &nbsp;”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jeez. &nbsp;You should just give up on being an adventurer to become a merchant.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel’s lower extremities and head had been vulnerable compared to the other regions of her body. &nbsp;She now had defensive gears that could protect those regions. &nbsp;Artpe purchased a robe made out of a black fabric. &nbsp;The threads were knitted using the quills of the Darkness Hedgehog, which had the ability to manipulate magical energy. &nbsp;The robe increased one’s Mana by a small amount, and it had a modest ability to obstruct other’s perception. &nbsp;This was why he had to pay 6 golds for it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In truth, these equipment weren’t something that could be obtained by level 40s. &nbsp;The power of money was really great.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There, Maetel. &nbsp;You should be pretty safe wearing these.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah. &nbsp;Ah-ooh. &nbsp;It is so expensive. &nbsp;These expensive items are for me…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fact that Artpe had obtained 10 gold by selling a weird powder was already shocking in itself. &nbsp;Now that she saw so much gold being exchanged for their equipment, she became delirious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The cows we can buy with that much money…. &nbsp;One, two three…. &nbsp;Ooh-ahhhhh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Calm down, Maetel. &nbsp;Also, I want to purchase water and food with the remaining money, ajumma. &nbsp;Give me the cheapest ones.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not an ajumma! &nbsp;I’m a green spring girl!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If ajumma is a maiden, then I’m a hero.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ooh-ahhhhhhhhh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mycenae didn’t know that Artpe was really a hero. &nbsp;She was infuriated when she saw his sly smile! &nbsp;However, the heroes weren’t paying attention to her anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ooh ooh. &nbsp;I don’t like food that doesn’t taste good…...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A hard bread you eat right now will come back as tenderloin steak in the future. &nbsp;You have to be patient.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......yes, I’ll be patient! &nbsp;I’ll wait until happiness comes to Artpe and I!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, you don’t have to wait that long.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mycenae took the money pouch put forth by Artpe. &nbsp;She emptied it, then she started preparing the dry foods and water. &nbsp;Mycenae was dumbfounded as she heard Artpe placate Maetel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You guys act as if you’ve been clearing Dungeons for 20 years. &nbsp;You guys must have received fantastic training at home.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“None of your business.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He spoke in a brusque manner as he received the bag with dry foods and canteens containing water. &nbsp;After he put away the items inside his robe, he let out a sigh as he raised his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mycenae somehow managed to regain her business smile. &nbsp;She gave him a cute smile, yet Artpe was apathetic. &nbsp;He shooed her off with his hand as he spoke to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, you should go now. &nbsp;We’ll probably meet again soon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll see my customers off from here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nope. &nbsp;Go. &nbsp;Ajumma has to leave, then I’ll be able to take out the treasure chest you are standing on.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“······.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, Mycenae sank to the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She never expected him to be aware of it! &nbsp;She had endured all the humiliation up until now as an attempt to get him to act careless. &nbsp;She even sold her wares at a very cheap price, yet at that moment, her plan went up in smoke!</span></p>
