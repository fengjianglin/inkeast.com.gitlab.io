 <p>Chapter 23 - Yesterday's Enemy (2)</p>
 <p><span style>There was an open space on the other side of the brush. &nbsp;Blood and metal shavings were flying into the surrounding. &nbsp;In a blink of an eye, a person’s life was lost. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was group trying to protect someone, and the other group was trying to erase someone. &nbsp;All kinds of ambitions were overflowing from them, and the humans were being consumed by it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kill the crown prince! &nbsp;We have to kill that bastard to end all of this!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Protect him! &nbsp;We have to protect him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their words made it very easy to identify them! &nbsp;If the world was full of people like them, there would be no need for mind reading magic!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uht!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aht!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Artpe and Maetel arrived at the clearing, every participant of the battle noticed their arrival.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One group looked back at them with hope, and the other group looked on with annoyance. &nbsp;However, when they confirmed the identity of the new arrivals, the expressions on both sides crumpled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They are children….!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk. &nbsp;The number of people we have to take care of increased.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this point, Artpe had finished dividing them into enemies and allies. He turned to look at Maetel. &nbsp;His expression was like that of a tutor expecting a child to give the right answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her face was full of questions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Artpe.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He knew it was going to be like this. &nbsp;Artpe let out a sigh as he gave her an explanation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did I tell you? &nbsp;You kill those who wants to kill you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe raised his hand, and he pointed towards one group. &nbsp;This particular group was wearing &nbsp;black clothes over their body. &nbsp;It was as if they had shopped from the same cloth store. &nbsp;The crown prince was probably amongst the group fighting a defensive battle. &nbsp;&nbsp;The ones in black had said, ‘The number of people we have to take care of increased.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They said they want to take care of us, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah. &nbsp;I see!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then let me pose you a problem. &nbsp;When they said they wanted to take care of us, what were they referring to?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmmmm. They are going to send us away after giving us an explanation?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wrong. &nbsp;The answer is they will send us to hell without giving us an explanation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How dare they…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two brats had appeared out of nowhere, and they were having a conversation as if they were doing a gag routine. &nbsp;The two groups had been in the midst of fighting for their lives, so the sight in front of them looked ridiculous. &nbsp;Everyone was looking at Artpe’s party in disbelief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shouldn’t you be feeling fear? &nbsp;Or maybe you should start running away? &nbsp;Kids these days are too dumb.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fay…number 3. &nbsp;You take care of them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The black clad group continued attacking the defenders, and only a single one of them ran towards Maetel and Artpe. &nbsp;He used the most popular line within the book called ‘150 Lines Most Used by Villains.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Blame your bad luck!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe took a peek at Maetel. &nbsp;As expected, she was frozen like a statue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Maetel.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah. &nbsp;Ah-ooh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She wasn’t afraid of her enemy's abilities. &nbsp;She was frightened of the truth that she was no longer fighting monsters. &nbsp;She had to face off against a human.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, Artpe.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hoo.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t blame her for acting foolishly in front of an enemy. &nbsp;She was a child, who possessed a tender heart, so this result was to be expected. &nbsp;This reaction was actually preferable. &nbsp;If Maetel had unhesitatingly charged forward to kill the man, Artpe would have been frightened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, Artpe assessed the situation, and he decided on what he would do.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Get out of the way, Maetel.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kyahk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had pushed Maetel to the side as he stepped in front of her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are a little brat, but it seems you think of yourself as a man? &nbsp;You plan on protecting the female!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Artpe!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe made himself the target by stepping forward unarmed. &nbsp;This move incited the enemy, and it put Maetel on alert. &nbsp;He was killing two birds with one stone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The generic Villain 1 fell for his provocation. &nbsp;He headed towards Artpe with his sword raised. &nbsp;Maetel had been pushed to the side, and her eyes were wide open as she watched the sight in front of her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sharp blade of the enemy was heading towards Artpe, and it was getting bigger in her vision. There was a clear blue tint of Mana surrounding the blade! &nbsp;It was a powerful skill that couldn’t be stopped with Artpe’s unprotected body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll give you a clean death! Power Stri….khhhhk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Villian 1 had swung his sword towards Artpe. &nbsp;When Maetel saw this, her eyes flipped over as she unsheathed her bastard sword from her waist. &nbsp;She did it with one hand. &nbsp;She wasn't thinking about anything. &nbsp;Her body reacted on instinct.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Villain 1 was yet to pass level 100, so Maetel split him from the groin to the top of the head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fay...lan….?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What the…...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two weighty sound was heard when the body fell to the floor. &nbsp;At that moment, all sounds within the clearing ceased.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It didn’t matter if someone was on the offensive end or the defensive end of the fight. &nbsp;All of them focused their gazes on the girl holding the bastard sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“······.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Crazy… &nbsp;Right now… &nbsp;What did you….?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, the nearby people were surprised. &nbsp;However, Artpe didn’t care about the background characters. &nbsp;Artpe only looked at Maetel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The girl had killed someone for the first time. &nbsp;She hadn’t done it for herself. &nbsp;She had done it for someone else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He tried to kill Artpe.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel had seen what she had done, yet she mumbled to herself as if she couldn’t believe it. &nbsp;She was gripping the the sword so hard that her knuckles were white.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We just came here… &nbsp;&nbsp;We came here for a look, yet you guys tried to kill Artpe.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That girl is dangerous. &nbsp;Everyone…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she didn’t allow her enemies to talk amongst themselves. &nbsp;Maetel pointed the bastard sword towards the ‘enemies’ as she asked a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She didn’t ask it towards her enemies. &nbsp;It was for Artpe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Artpe, you said I can do whatever I want to do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I did.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.....all right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>No more words were necessary.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In a flash, Maetel’s hesitancy had disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dodge it. &nbsp;Block…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hoo-ahhhhhhhhp!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel pushed off the ground as she ran forward. &nbsp;She swung her bastard sword laterally. &nbsp;Each of her opponents tried emitting Mana into their weapons or body parts. &nbsp;They were attempting to use a defensive or a counter skill. &nbsp;However, they were all dispatched with a single blow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were several high rank Class that were over level 100 present within the group. &nbsp;However, all the defensive technique were canceled by Maetel’s basic active attack skill!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won’t forgive you! &nbsp;I won’t! &nbsp;You guys are all bad! &nbsp;That is what I decided!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She wasn’t using Berserk right now. &nbsp;In fact, she hadn’t even activated her gauntlet’s option yet either. &nbsp;It was quite simple. &nbsp;There was an amazing amount of talent gap between Maetel and the men.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Koo-ahk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is a nightmare. &nbsp;How can such a young child do this against elite knights….!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The elite knights of the humans were in such a poor state. &nbsp;He now understood why the Demon King had moved at a leisurely pace. &nbsp;Artpe smirked when he realized that the strongest amongst them was barely level 120. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Run away. &nbsp;There is no way…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won’t let you run away!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The number of black clad villains went from 20 to 17, 14, 10..... &nbsp;The number became five, and now there were only two of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W...who sent you! &nbsp;Reveal yourselves!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We have to retreat. &nbsp;If we aren’t able to notify the second party about the location of the crown prince...koo-ahk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then there was one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know who you guys are, but you will regret doing this someday.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then there were zero.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hoo…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Right now… &nbsp;What the hell just happened?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All our pursuers are dead. &nbsp;I don’t believe it…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After killing everyone, Maetel lightly flicked her bastard sword once to get rid of the blood. &nbsp;After she sheathed her sword, she turned to look at Artpe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Artpehhhhh~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had been beyond brave. &nbsp;She have been frighteningly decisive in her actions, but unlike before, her eyes were full of unshed tears now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, yes. &nbsp;You did very well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He knew her heart would be in tumult right now. &nbsp;Artpe let out a bitter laugh as he hugged her. She was crying, because she was afraid of her own self more so than anyone. &nbsp;It felt as if he could feel her feelings vividly through the hands holding her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once, he had been like her. &nbsp;His personality was unbecoming of a Demon. &nbsp;He had despaired, as he had hated himself more so than anyone over the years.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Should I really be doing things like this? &nbsp;It feels like I did something very wrong.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, you did well. &nbsp;Even if you were in the wrong, there will never come a day when you will realize that fact. &nbsp;That is why you don’t have to worry too much about it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Artpe…...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe used a messed up oxymoron to console her as he stroked her head. &nbsp;The people, who had been watching the fight, was taken aback. &nbsp;Their round eyes were full of shock. &nbsp;They looked like they wanted to ask what kind of third rate skit this was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was an armored woman holding a steel sword amongst the group. &nbsp;She spoke to Artpe as she expressed a bit of wariness towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you very much for helping us. &nbsp;However, it would be best if you don’t get involved with us….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. &nbsp;All right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She hadn’t even started giving him a proper explanation! &nbsp;The woman was taken aback. &nbsp;As expected of the owner of the Read All Creation ability, he was the best in the world at reading a situation. &nbsp;Artpe continued to stroke the head of the sniffling Maetel as he spoke to the woman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We saw nothing here. &nbsp;I don’t care about what happened here. &nbsp;We were passing by, and we just killed couple monsters. &nbsp;That should be fine, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman was surprised when he gave her the exact answer she had wanted to hear. &nbsp;Artpe snorted when he saw this, then he turned around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go, Maetel.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is it really alright to just leave like this, Artpe? &nbsp;We can just go? ”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We did as you wished by helping them, and this is the result. &nbsp;They don’t want us to get involved with them. &nbsp;Then our business with them is at an end. &nbsp;We can go do what we want to do.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.....sniff. &nbsp;All right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel had accepted his answer, so he was about to head back to the warm fire. &nbsp;He was consoling Maetel as he walked away when it occurred.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Someone yelled towards them from the other party.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the voice of a young man. &nbsp;Artpe didn’t stop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I told you to stop! &nbsp;This is the order of the crown prince!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You hid like a mouse during the fight, so I thought you were some poor mute. &nbsp;I see now that you are quite loud.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kook….!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The crown prince shut his mouth at Artpe’s sharp retort.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At times, truth was more cruel than anything else. &nbsp;Moreover, he had just seen a girl that was the same age as him fight, and he couldn’t hold a candle against her. &nbsp;This was why his pride was deeply hurt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Y...you are being rude! &nbsp;As he had revealed, he is the next in line to ascend to the throne of the Diaz Kingdom…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn’t I say I saw nothing? &nbsp;Are you guys idiots?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oohk....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He could tolerate foolish behaviors only up to a certain point. &nbsp;He had been trying to part ways with them as he pretended he didn’t know what was going on, yet they revealed themselves anyways. &nbsp;They even tried to use an authority they no longer possessed in an attempt to stop Artpe and Maetel!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe let out a sigh as he started walking once again….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Help me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your highness!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The kingdom is in turmoil, because of the rebels! &nbsp;I must go back to to the place someday, and I must get my revenge for my father the king. &nbsp;I have to regain my throne. &nbsp;If I want to do so, I need strong people like you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The boy was pretty straightforward, and he showed some promise!? &nbsp;Still, this didn’t mean Artpe had stopped walking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You should go look for help somewhere else. &nbsp;Let’s go, Maetel.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. &nbsp;I hate the palace!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She firmly believed that the palace had tasteless food. &nbsp;This was why the palace was a place where she would never get close to! &nbsp;Maetel grabbed the sleeve of Artpe’s robe, and she obediently followed behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W...wait a moment!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The boy finally made his appearance as he pushed past his protectors! &nbsp;He looked to be of similar age as Artpe and Maetel. &nbsp;He was a strikingly good-looking boy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He yelled loudly towards Artpe and Maetel. &nbsp;He stared at Maetel, who had displayed overwhelming martial prowess.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you guys are the subjects of this land, you should help the one that would become the ruler of this land in the future….! &nbsp;I do not lie. &nbsp;I will give both of you a big reward in the future! &nbsp;I swear it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wanted to escape this pattern of events. &nbsp;Artpe let out a sigh. &nbsp;He turned around as he gave an answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then give me half of the world.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm!? &nbsp;T...that is….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At Artpe’s out of the blue request, the crown prince’s eyes narrowed. &nbsp;He was only a crown prince of a kingdom, and he was on the run. &nbsp;How could he offer half of the world! &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe clicked his tongue..</span></p>
 <p><span style>“At a minimum, the Demon King offers this deal to the hero. &nbsp;You should come back after reading a book called, ‘How to Propose an Offer that Can’t be Turned Down.’”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a very sweet opportunity. &nbsp;However, Maetel just assumed Artpe didn’t want to get involved in something annoying. &nbsp;She was somewhat correct, but it wasn’t the whole truth. &nbsp;Artpe didn’t have that bad of a personality.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Except….</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘How could I forget about him? &nbsp;That bastard was originally the crown prince of the Diaz Kingdom…..’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In his past life, he had been the enemy of the hero. &nbsp;The hero’s heart was too soft, so she had been unable to kill Artpe. &nbsp;This was why the thief ruthlessly plunged his dagger into Artpe’s heart to deal the killing blow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you refusing to even hear me out! &nbsp;If you succeed in this task, I said I would give you a very generous reward! &nbsp;Moreover, the one with the ability is the girl, so why do you keep answering for her!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The crown prince was shouting at Artpe with all his might. &nbsp;Artpe saw the face of the thief superimpose over the face of this boy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, I just don't want to do it. &nbsp;I don’t like you! &nbsp;I’m not doing it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why not!”</span></p>
