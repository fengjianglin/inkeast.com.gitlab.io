 <p>Chapter 17 - Our Sunbae-nim Did This? (1)</p>
 <p><span style>Artpe headed down the stair leading towards the 35th floor. &nbsp;He grinded his teeth as the Dungeon shamelessly showed no signs of ending.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What kind of Dungeon is this!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aren’t all Dungeons like this, Artpe?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel’s innocent eyes shone as she asked the question. &nbsp;She had drawn the short end of the stick by coming into this brutal Dungeon as her first Dungeon. &nbsp;However, she didn’t have the proper perspective to know any better. &nbsp;She didn’t get tired of this place, and she didn’t complain. &nbsp;She possessed an essential virtue needed as a Dungeon explorer….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm. &nbsp;What I’m trying to say is…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe couldn’t tell if this was a good thing or not. &nbsp;Therefore, he evaded giving an answer by stroking her head. &nbsp;In turn, Maetel’s eyes narrowed in pleasure as if she was a cat. &nbsp;&nbsp;Mycenae had left behind her cart to look at them. &nbsp;She had a gentle look in her eyes as she spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It looks as if you are training an animal, customer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shut up. &nbsp;I want 245 gold.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You said you’ll sell it to me for 230 gold a moment ago!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The price on items aren’t fixed. &nbsp;The price can fluctuate depending on my condition or if the other person is being rude. &nbsp;Let’s see… &nbsp;Right now it should be 247…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Two hundred forty five gold! &nbsp;I’ll buy it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this rate, Mycenae knew the price might increase further, so she quickly pushed the money towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Koo-ooooooooooh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe grinned as he handed her the item. &nbsp;Mycenae used her observation magic to check the item, and she let out a groan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kook. &nbsp;As expected, it is a really good weapon…. &nbsp;Your ability to price an item is really uncanny. &nbsp;It makes me want to recruit you into the Anywhere company.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You won’t steal Artpe away from me, ajumma!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m really not an ajumma!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel, who had been standing there like a lamb, quickly hid Artpe behind her. &nbsp;Then she bared her teeth towards Mycenae. &nbsp;It made one wonder if she was a dog or some form of an animal in her previous life. &nbsp;Artpe patted Maetel, who was seriously worried.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even if I wanted to go, I won’t be able to. &nbsp;Don’t worry about it. &nbsp;Anyways, if you sell that item to anyone, you’ll be unable to handle the aftermath. &nbsp;Be careful.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The identity of the artifact handed over to Mycenae was a Blood Gold Halberd, which held the curse of madness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It accelerated the destruction of the user’s mind as a powerful downside, but the weapon would all one to destroy all enemies and allies alike.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Maetel already had control over her Berserk skill, so it was a useless weapon for her. &nbsp;Moreover, the weapon was too heavy for Artpe to wield.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, it would be an attractive option to most adventurers or mercenaries. &nbsp;The weapon would lead the user down a path of destruction, yet ambition made people take up such weapons. &nbsp;It was a trait inherent in all humans.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hoo hoo. &nbsp;As a merchant, my duty is to sell it at a high price. &nbsp;It is beyond my province to determine, who becomes the owner of an item.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are an unscrupulous trader.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe let out a bitter laugh as he took out 100 gold from his pouch, and he pushed it towards Mycenae. &nbsp;She already knew what he would ask for. &nbsp;Mycenae didn’t give a reply as she took the money. &nbsp;Then she prepared the potions, water and ration.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past year, she had appeared each time they moved onto the next floor. &nbsp;She monopolized the trade with them as they moved from the 6th floor to the 34th floor. &nbsp;This type of trade was almost automatic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Excuse me, customer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She put together items worth 100 gold with no frills. &nbsp;Mycenae asked a question as she divided the items between Artpe and Maetel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is the identity of this Dungeon? &nbsp;Why does it continue to go on like this? &nbsp;Does it perhaps have a tunnel leading to the demon world at the end?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We are exploring this place to find that answer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You aren’t able to come up with a conjecture using your ability?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mycenae had a truly surprised expression on her face. &nbsp;Artpe snorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think you have too high of an opinion in regards to my ability.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As the number of floor gets deeper, the items that are coming out are increasingly to my liking. From my perspective, I wouldn’t mind if the Dungeon goes on for another 100 floors…. &nbsp;Still, it is clear that this Dungeon wasn’t formed naturally. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You probably already guessed this, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe’s nodded his head in a self-possessed manner. &nbsp;Then he looked down at the stairway leading to the 35th floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ghouls that were around 2 levels higher than the ones on the 34th floor was probably waiting for them on the next floor. &nbsp;If not, there would be a single jump in difficulty, and new monsters might show up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This Dungeon was created by someone with a clear goal in mind. &nbsp;It is true and definite that the two of us aren’t challengers that are compatible with that goal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Normally, one would usually search the history of the region gain some clues about the Dungeon. &nbsp;If you want such a research done, I can do it for you. &nbsp;&nbsp;I’ll gladly accept a commission to research about the history of this region….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll see you later, ajumma.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I knew you will answer in such a way.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mycenae grumbled as she went away. &nbsp;She notched another loss to him. &nbsp;She accepted the clean loss as she disappeared alongside the light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, after he sent her away, her words made him become mired in his thoughts again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The history of this region…...?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>According to his knowledge, this region was where the hero was born. &nbsp;There hadn’t been anything special. &nbsp;It was a place where there was a normal town near the mountain. &nbsp;He knew from his past life that nothing much had occurred here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, how could there be nothing here? &nbsp;Even now, he was in a strange Dungeon that was made by someone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maybe, this place was hidden? &nbsp;What if this place was shielded from the eyes of the hero and Demon King?</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past, the hero hadn’t wanted to desecrate a grave, because she was raised properly by her family. &nbsp;It could have also been the fact that she was quickly sent packing to the royal palace as if she was some fragile glass statue. &nbsp;In the end, she hadn’t discovered this place. &nbsp;Was there some enormous secret hidden here?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What happened here in the past? &nbsp;Did something of significance happen here?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had no way of finding out. &nbsp;Even if Artpe had the Read All Creation ability, he couldn’t see into the past to a time when he wasn’t alive. &nbsp;It was impossible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, if such a thing was possible…..</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Artpe…..?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.....it’s nothing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel was looking at his face with a worried look in her eyes. &nbsp;Artpe shook his head to dislodge such thoughts, and he answered her. &nbsp;Unexpectedly, Maetel looked slightly wistful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your face was incredibly serious and dashing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmph. That kind of sweet words will only work against the Four Heavenly Kings of the Demon king’s army.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was why such words worked on him. &nbsp;It was a direct hit. &nbsp;Artpe let out a fake cough as he tried to hide the fullness he felt within his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t know what would appear in front of them. &nbsp;It was something that couldn’t be confirmed unless one saw it with one’s eyes. &nbsp;He also knew that priority of this Dungeon had changed when he found out how the Dungeon was structured.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In other words, they were too far down the road to back off now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘In my past life, the hero wasted five years of her life at the castle. &nbsp;We have a lot of time to spare.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, even if Artpe had used all types of methods to focus on leveling up, it was unclear as to whether he would have been able to achieve a better result than this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They would have missed out on fighting a horde of Skeletons linked by a rare magic called Record Link. &nbsp;They would have missed out on the precious EXP, and the artifacts they received as reward. &nbsp;They wouldn’t have been amass this much fortune. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The factor that tipped the scale was the fact that Artpe and Maetel was able to develop so many high quality Skills here. &nbsp;It was crazy. &nbsp;If they hadn’t drawn this Dungeon as their first starting place, he wondered if they would have been able to develop skills like Berserk and Mana Link.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if they continued to stay inside the Dungeon for five years, it wouldn’t impede with their development.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Ah. &nbsp;Of course, I have to get out of here and find those places as soon as possible…..’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe possessed the memories of his past life, so he had several significant advantages he could acquire for himself. &nbsp;He was talking about spell books of great magic, ancient ruins and the like.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Artpe battled within the Dungeon, he created a hierarchy of which goodies he will go for first. &nbsp;&nbsp;He would gain enough level in the Dungeon where they would be able to travel the world without worry. &nbsp;They will start traveling according to the list he had made.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was why they didn’t have time to hesitate or look back on what had already occurred. &nbsp;It didn’t matter what waited for them. &nbsp;They would move forward. &nbsp;This was the will of Maetel and Artpe even if their destination differed!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After they smoothly defeat the Demon King, he would have the means to be able to raise cows in the countryside. &nbsp;At that time, he would be done with Maetel! &nbsp;He didn’t care if she wanted to become the queen of a country or a female pope of a religion she built. &nbsp;She was free to do whatever she wanted!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Until that time arrived, Artpe and Maetel had to live a healthy and well-off life. &nbsp;In the immediate future, they would have to pass this Dungeon without any complications.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aren’t you tired, Maetel? &nbsp;Shall we head down after we sleep?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not tired, Artpe. &nbsp;What about you, Artpe? &nbsp;Do you want to use my lap as a pillow?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m also not tired.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel grumbled as if she was dissatisfied with his answer. &nbsp;Artpe led Maetel down to the Dungeon’s 35th floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, a powerful vibration shook the Dungeon. &nbsp;Accompanying the tremor, a wet and moldy voice could be heard in their ears.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[This test has been maintained for a very long time.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘That is a pretty ominous introduction!?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as if a legendary figure was about to step forward from the darkness if they took a step forward. &nbsp;It was a line given by a being, who would drop the adventurers into hell!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, let’s head back for a moment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Denied.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he heard the introductory line emanating from the darkness, Artpe immediately knew something was wrong. &nbsp;He quickly ordered a retreat as soon as they stepped onto this floor. &nbsp;However, the way back to the 34th floor was blocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You bastards are only allowed to go forward.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You talk a pretty good game… &nbsp;Ooh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe was clicking his tongue as he tried to use his Mana. &nbsp;However, the torches mounted on the wall started to light up in order starting from the nearest torches. &nbsp;The light from the fire revealed the layout of the 35th floor. &nbsp;Artpe groaned when he saw them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“....crazy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Look at them, Artpe….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were in a really large square, and there were a very, very ,very ,very ,very ,very large number of armored knights filling the place. &nbsp;The armored knights boasted a much more domineering spirit compared to the Ghouls. &nbsp;&nbsp;It was obvious that Undeads were within the armor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[We’ve been waiting for you, destroyer of rules.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Insolent brat. &nbsp;&nbsp;You are the honey tongued brat that defies logic.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your judgement is close at hand.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even in death, these beings hadn’t forgotten the will and techniques carved into their bodies. &nbsp;They were knights, who had a sense of self. &nbsp;They were Death Knights. &nbsp;All of them were powerful, and they were all over level 150. &nbsp;There were 500 of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If a normal level 120 party was to fight this group, the possibility of them winning was uncertain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The one standing in the lead raised its bastard sword towards Artpe as its helmet rattled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have caused dishonor to all of us. &nbsp;You have corrupted the pure hero by spitting on our intent. &nbsp;You have looked down on our power. &nbsp;Your misguided will is now encased in a powerful body, and the worst of the situation has come to pass. You made fool of fate. &nbsp;You connected things that shouldn’t be connected, and you severed things you shouldn’t have severed.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>All the Death Knights followed the one in the lead as they pointed their swords towards Artpe. &nbsp;During all of this, they hadn’t shown much hostility towards Maetel. &nbsp;They directed all their hate towards Artpe as if he was their mortal enemy. &nbsp;It annoyed Artpe. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>These bastards were quick in assessing the situation!</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Still, we cannot deny the fact that you are a hero. &nbsp;This is why we will give you this last chance. &nbsp;If you take this last test properly, we will believe in this reality that had be turned on its head. &nbsp;We will trust in the hope blooming from within the darkness that will cause change to the future. &nbsp;We will go back to sleep.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, you don’t really have to believe in me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ominous feeling was increasing as time passed. &nbsp;Artpe readied the only specialty magic he possessed. &nbsp;He readied himself to use Hyper Rubbing, then he grasped Maetel’s shoulder. &nbsp;It was signal for her to get ready for battle. &nbsp;It also told her to be careful of their enemies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry about it, Artpe.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even in such a situation, Maetel’s expression was calm. &nbsp;In the past year, her features had matured considerably. &nbsp;She already looked like an angel, but her beautiful smile made her look like an archangel. &nbsp;She gave a reassurance to Artpe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll protect Artpe. &nbsp;Artpe will protect me in return?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“....yes. &nbsp;I trust you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The shield on Artpe’s back rose into the air. &nbsp;He only had to repair the shield couple times as they descended from the 6th floor to the 35th floor. &nbsp;This was why the shield hadn’t been replaced with other weapons. &nbsp;It was a rare artifact that gave a weak curse to whatever it hit. &nbsp;If he was with the shield, there was nothing for him to fear!</span></p>
 <p><span style>[When the battle starts, he might use cheap tactics to play us off against each other.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the enemies he would face were excessively resolute in defending against mental warfare.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[This is why we will force the activation of the final test, so you can face it.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uh, hey… &nbsp;Wait a moment, you guys·.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe tried to speak up when he realized what they were about to do, but the Death Knights just glared at Artpe as they plunged their swords into their hearts. &nbsp;Their Mana flooded forth! &nbsp;The restriction of the Record Link made it impossible to attack one’s comrades, but it seemed suicide was possible!</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he faced the domineering sight, Artpe yelled out in shock.</span></p>
