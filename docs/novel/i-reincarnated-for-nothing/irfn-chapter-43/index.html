 <p>Chapter 43 - Hero VS Kingdom (5)</p>
 <p><span style>Artpe hadn’t chosen the site of the construction on a whim. &nbsp;There was a large open space on the mountainside. &nbsp;It was the ideal place to build a city. &nbsp;Many people would be able to live there. &nbsp;Moreover, this place was highly visible. &nbsp;If soldiers and black magicians were tracking them, it would be quite easy for them to find this place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is my last chance to nip this in the bud before this blows up into something big. &nbsp;If their ability to judge a situation is not compromised, they would send their biggest force towards us in haste when they realize what I’m trying to do here. &nbsp;They’ll try to completely bury this in the darkness.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was why Artpe had baited them. &nbsp;Instead of allowing them to increase the casualties of the innocents, Artpe decided to give them a target they can focus on. &nbsp;As if to confirm his thought process, the soldiers immediately gathered towards the mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That wasn’t all. &nbsp;There was a geographical advantage that inevitably came with being located midway up the mountain. &nbsp;Anyone that discovered and climbed towards the city would all be considered to be enemies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lastly, while he was destroying the mountain to construct the city, Artpe had executed the final touch to his plan. &nbsp;It was inevitable for him to upturn the earth when he uprooted the trees. &nbsp;In the process of doing so, how difficult would it be for him to prepare a trap within the terrain?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Koo-ahhhhhhhhhhk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“T...the ground is eroding! &nbsp;The soil...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>For example, Artpe had buried crystal balls that had been about to explode from being stuffed with Mana. &nbsp;He buried them deep in the ground, and he detonated them to cause massive casualties to his enemies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W...water!? &nbsp;My god! &nbsp;The valley! &nbsp;The water is coming from the valley!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ggoo-ahhhhhhhhhhk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>For example, he might have done some funny business while he constructed the waterways. His enemies would be swept away by the sewage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boulders······ &nbsp;There are large boulders”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, no…. &nbsp;Oh my god.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Koo-poo-aht!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>For example, he had stacked up a pile of boulders that he had excavated from the construction work. &nbsp;He sent them rolling as he caused the landslide.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Koo-ahhhhhhhk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“R...run away…. &nbsp;Kah-ahk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Several thousand soldiers immediately died before they could enter into a battle. &nbsp;They hadn’t even been able to locate their enemies before they were hit with a natural disaster. &nbsp;&nbsp;The road to mountain wasn’t steep. &nbsp;However, a considerable number of soldiers and black magicians had already suffered horrible deaths.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Devil.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s a devil here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A devil lives in this mountain! &nbsp;Run away!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Who would actually want to climb up this mountain? &nbsp;The morale of the soldiers immediately bottomed out. &nbsp;The black magicians were too afraid of the unknown beings that resided on top of the mountain, so their feet were stuck to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If they are able to use such tactics, what level are these magicians! &nbsp;How many of them are there!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ooh ooh. &nbsp;This is terrifying. &nbsp;What spell was that? &nbsp;I...I can’t win against that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe’s purple eyes let out a steady light as he moved his fingers through the air. &nbsp;The Mana Strings followed the movements of his fingers as additional landslides occurred.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The structure of all creation was seen through his eyes, so it was possible to know what would happen if certain parts were severed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kooo-ahhhhhhhhhhk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“H...help me······.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh Demon King!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The death throes of numerous people rang out. &nbsp;Death upon death was piling on as their blood became a lake, and their corpses became a hill. &nbsp;As if to add insult to injury, casualties continued to mount.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, they had nowhere else to go. &nbsp;If they were able to act freely, they would have left at the outset.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huhk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“L...look at what’s happening down there. &nbsp;What’s going on…...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I...it’s an earthquake.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, the townspeople became aware of the fact that something was happening nearby. &nbsp;It was almost miraculous, but their current location was left alone. &nbsp;Still, the rest of the mountain was collapsing, so they couldn’t help but notice it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The soldiers below…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The magician-nim is wiping them out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He isn't making any large gestures. &nbsp;He is just waving his hands!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was using Mana Strings in conjunction with his Read All Creation ability. &nbsp;He looked like a god to the people around him. &nbsp;In truth, this was all possible, because he had made countless preparations beforehand. &nbsp;The people around him didn’t know this fact. &nbsp;Basically, his abilities were great for bluffing!</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The difference between a Four Heavenly King and a hero is paper thin.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe was pleased as he waved his hands. &nbsp;An additional 100 soldiers died from one wave, and another 80 died at his next gesture. &nbsp;Endless pain, screams and despair filled the bottom of mountain. &nbsp;However, Artpe didn’t pay the slightest attention to them. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He already knew this would happen from the beginning. &nbsp;This was why he had sent Maetel to a different location. &nbsp;Maetel was now adept at discerning between good and evil. &nbsp;However, she couldn't put aside her tendency to shoulder every death onto her shoulders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘However, I’m able to shrug it off.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the very least, the part of him that was the Four Heavenly King of the Demon King’s army was better suited for this task than a hero. &nbsp;He was able to kill strangers to accomplish his goals. &nbsp;It was something one couldn’t do unless one was able easily forget about such deeds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had lived under the unreasonable orders from the Demon King. &nbsp;He had lived through an unreasonable world. &nbsp;When the numbers of beings he had killed exceeded a million, it was possible for him to forget about their deaths. &nbsp;Therefore, there was no way Artpe would feel much when he was killing those that deserved death!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is it about done now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had waved his hands for an hour. &nbsp;When Artpe confirmed that no troops were entering into the mountain, he retracted his hands. &nbsp;At this point, the mountain looked completely different from before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, if we can get up and down from this place, it should be fine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I wonder if we can be prosperous living on this mountain…...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This place that had been normal mountain A to the villagers. &nbsp;However, this mountain would now be long remembered in history. &nbsp;They had a faraway look as they looked at their residential environment, but they couldn’t make their complaints known to Artpe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, Artpe knew what they were feeling inside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You should focus on the construction instead of paying attention to me. &nbsp;Do you really think it’ll end with just one attack?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heek!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A...a force of that size is going to come again?!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It might be a larger force. &nbsp;It’ll be good for you guys if I can take care of them while I’m still here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A chill went up their spines when they heard his words. &nbsp;The people meekly went back to work. &nbsp;Artpe snorted as he exited the construction site.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘So then, let’s…....’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had purposefully spared one person. &nbsp;Amongst the black magicians, there had been one that possessed decent power, yet he had been very passive. &nbsp;He kept looking around at his surrounding in a cautious manner. &nbsp;Artpe buried everyone except him. &nbsp;He let this particular magician run away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The bastard probably thought he was lucky. &nbsp;He probably thought that he had survived, because he had more sense than the others. &nbsp;To be precise, Artpe had enticed the black magician to act this way. &nbsp;Artpe had made the black magician think that he was clever in his escape.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the black magician never escaped Artpe’s sight from the beginning to the end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Reinforcement.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Artpe was walking quickly, he used the Reinforcement skill on his boots.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It immediately allowed him to activate the Blink magic. &nbsp;The ability of the boots had been amplified, so he would be able to use Blink once or twice a day without consuming any of his Mana. &nbsp;It also considerably extended the range of the Blink magic. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he could advance in his Reinforcement skill, he could probably use an additional Blink. &nbsp;However, his current capabilities was enough.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmph!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe used consecutive Blinks as he kicked off the ground. &nbsp;In a flash, he was already running across the base of the mountain. &nbsp;In his previous life, it would have been impossible for him to move like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He never imagined there would come a day when he would be able to physically exert himself like this. &nbsp;The title of a Hero wasn’t an empty one. &nbsp;As he had leveled up in the past year, he hadn’t just grown in terms of magical energy. &nbsp;His physical stats had also made rapid progress.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, his physical abilities were laughable when compared to a level 160 Warrior, but he was on a different level when compared to a mage of similar level. &nbsp;Artpe looked exactly like a typical magician on the outside. &nbsp;This was why they wouldn’t know about Artpe’s physical capabilities. &nbsp;This gave him an advantage against his opponents.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Another Blink and…. Good. &nbsp;I caught you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuhk!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had quickly descended the mountain, and he was finally successful in grabbing the black magician by the back of his neck. &nbsp;As expected of a cautious and meticulous person, the black magician was equipped with an Artifact that attacked an ambusher. &nbsp;However, it was effective only if the enemy was unaware of the trap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, Artpe knew the activation condition of the Artifact. &nbsp;He also knew its shape, structure and power. &nbsp;When he grabbed the black magician, he immediately destroyed it with his Mana String. &nbsp;The Artifact didn’t activate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huhk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The black magician was shocked when he realized this fact. &nbsp;He had already realized that his opponent was on a different level than him. &nbsp;It was enough for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“P...please spare me! &nbsp;I’ll tell you everything!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All right. &nbsp;I was hoping you would say that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuhk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe moved as if he was about to charge forward, but he used the motion to plant his opponent’s head into the ground &nbsp;If he found out Artpe was a child, he might show some bravado. &nbsp;&nbsp;He had to pressure his opponent from the perch of absolute power. &nbsp;It would allow him to easily extract information out of the man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe put his foot on the man’s back as he asked the question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So, which Demon is cooperating with the Archduke?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a limit on how abrupt a topic should be broached. &nbsp;Artpe had already concluded that the Archduke was behind all of this, and he was cooperating with a Demon. &nbsp;He skipped over those parts to ask the next question!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed the black magician was taken aback by Artpe’s question, so he carefully opened his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Demon? &nbsp;I don’t know…. &nbsp;Heek.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe extended his Mana String, and he leisurely placed it around his opponent’s finger. &nbsp;It felt as if the Mana String was sharp enough to sever his finger at any moment. &nbsp;The man gulped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe spoke in a low voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your life is worth nothing to me, but I’m guessing that isn’t true for you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“C...correct.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That means your words must change next time you speak. Understood?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Y...yes, sir.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Threat and torture were essential skills for a Four Heavenly King in finding out a secret! &nbsp;Usually, heroes were unable to extract information. &nbsp;They were either too soft-hearted or inexperienced. &nbsp;It usually came back to bite them in the back, but that would never happen to Artpe!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I...it was a woman called Tienna. &nbsp;She conscripted some of the kingdom’s magicians. &nbsp;She said she would help the Archduke if he cooperated with her experiment….. &nbsp;I...I was one of the magician that was conscripted.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was telling the truth. &nbsp;He hadn’t originally been a black magician. &nbsp;He had went through a Class change to become one. &nbsp;Of course, he had come here following the orders of the Archduke, so his origin was unimportant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he had said her name was Tienna. &nbsp;If she had exited the Demon world to work within the human world, she would have to be talented. &nbsp;Artpe had never heard of her name in his past life. &nbsp;It probably was an alias…..</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe let out a sigh as he asked the question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I thought the Archduke was searching everywhere for the heroes. &nbsp;So how did he come up with an idiotic idea of cooperating with a Demon?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W...we were told that the Demon King won’t kill the heroes until the heroes attack the Demon King’s castle……....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kyahh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe never expected them to leak such important information at such an early stage!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It would be a lie to say he wasn’t feeling a bit nervous at facing a plan that was much more sophisticated than what the Demon King’s army carried out in his previous life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed the Demon King’s disposition as a chef hadn’t gone away!</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Still, the Archduke believed the information, and he gave consent to let the Demon into his country. &nbsp;Then there is the Demon King that refuse to catch the heroes when a really good opportunity presents itself. &nbsp;He continues to follow his recipe…...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wondered if it would cleaner to just let the world end. &nbsp;Originally, Artpe had no desire to protect the world. &nbsp;He had done his best to work towards his peaceful retirement, yet problems were coming at him from unexpected places. &nbsp;It sapped his energy away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I...I’m telling the truth! &nbsp;It sounds unbelievable, but that’s the story I was told! &nbsp;I completely understand your reaction. &nbsp;I didn’t believe it the first time I heard it, but….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All right. &nbsp;I believe you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then you are going to spare me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Before I do so, let me ask you the last question. &nbsp;What’s the size of the army waiting on standby? &nbsp;Speak.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The shortcut to victory was to take the enemies unawares before they could conduct an attack. &nbsp;A smile of triumph appeared on Artpe’s lips. &nbsp;It was best to upturn the table before the game could be set!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The black magician gave an answer</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is none······.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“······huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At Artpe’s questioning voice, the man gave additional information with a defeated voiced. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That was all of us······ It is impossible for the kingdom to spare any more soldiers. &nbsp;You’ve killed over 10,000 soldiers and over 20 black magicians. &nbsp;How can there be more? &nbsp;The Diaz Kingdom is ruined now. &nbsp;When the Archduke finds out about this, I’m sure he will cry…...”</span></p>
