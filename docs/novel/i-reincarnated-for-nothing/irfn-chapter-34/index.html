 <p>Chapter 34 - Come to Think of It, I'm a Hero (2)</p>
 <p><span style>“M...my name is Aena.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s enough with your self-introduction.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe stopped his face from crumpling when he saw the face of the girl. &nbsp;He brushed aside her words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want you to tell me your request, and what you will be able to give me. &nbsp;Keep it short.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“······.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was said from the olden times that it was crucial to clear a Quest as soon as possible! &nbsp;He just needed to know the content of the Quest and the reward. &nbsp;He didn’t care about minor details like her situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heek.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Artpe…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The girl, who came looking for them, and Maetel, who had been looking at Aena, turned to look at Artpe with dumbfounded expressions when they heard his words. &nbsp;Aena was barely able to open her mouth before Artpe’s expression could crumple.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I...in truth, the soldiers came to our town couple days ago. &nbsp;He was captured by them, and he hasn’t been returned…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All right. &nbsp;What’s the reward?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“······.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He even skipped the content of the Quest! &nbsp;If others heard his words, they might have been impressed by Artpe’s strong desire for obtaining a reward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Artpe’s expression was excessively harsh. &nbsp;It wasn’t directed at the girl or the quest. &nbsp;His anger seemed to be directed at someone else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A r...reward…. I don’t have anything I can give you…...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The girl looked like she was about to cry. &nbsp;Of course, Artpe knew this even before he heard her words. &nbsp;The girl wore very threadbare clothes, and when he checked with his Read All Creation ability, she didn’t possess any items worth having on her body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite this fact, Artpe continued to interrogate her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? &nbsp;You don’t even have a single bronze coin?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I do have a bronze coin, but that isn’t enough…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Aena’s eyes started to fill with tears. &nbsp;However, Artpe ruthlessly pushed his hand out towards her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Give it to me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“······what?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want you to take out the bronze coin.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Aena’s expression indicated that she had no idea what was going on, but she took out a bronze coin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She possessed a very dirty bronze coin. &nbsp;It held very little value to Artpe that he wanted to snort, but it was a very precious and large sum of money for the girl. The money was very important to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“H….here…...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Aena thought she had come looking for the wrong people. &nbsp;She thought she was getting ripped off in her time of need. &nbsp;Her eyes were shedding large amount of tears as she placed the bronze coin on top of Artpe’s hand. &nbsp;Maetel was very angry as she watched what was going on. &nbsp;She had to scold Artpe! &nbsp;She had to scold him a lot! &nbsp;Artpe that makes a child cry was a bad Artpe!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Artpe!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Be quiet, Maetel. &nbsp;I’m trying to assume the Quest Reward. &nbsp;Usually, not even dogs interrupt that process.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Y...yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Artpe replied as if he had predicted Maetel would become angry. &nbsp;She immediately shut her mouth. &nbsp;She was overwhelmed by Artpe’s attitude. &nbsp;She had no idea what made him so angry from the start, but Artpe was incredibly scary right now….. &nbsp;He also looked a little bit cool.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hoo-ooh······.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he quieted Maetel, he firmly gripped the coin he extorted from the girl. &nbsp;He put the coin away, and after he blinked once, he stood up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he spoke clearly towards the girl.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All right. &nbsp;I’ve accepted your Quest reward. &nbsp;Your payment in advance was 100%, and your balance is 0%. &nbsp;I will undertake the Quest starting now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the very first Quest he had accepted in his lifetime.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Our account is all settled now, so we are going to go find your dongsaeng”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes······?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Aena blinked her eyes as if she couldn’t believe what she had just heard. &nbsp;However, Artpe didn’t hesitate. &nbsp;He put on his robe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In truth, he was very sleepy, so he wanted to lie down. &nbsp;However, he could always sleep later. &nbsp;He felt restless right now. &nbsp;It felt as if he wouldn’t be able to take it if he didn’t move right now. &nbsp;This was why he prodded Aena into action in annoyance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you standing there doing nothing? I’ve received the reward, so I’m going to do the Quest. &nbsp;Are you deaf?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, no. &nbsp;But….!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m going to go find your dongsaeng starting now. &nbsp;I’ll somehow find a way to track him down, and I’ll return him to your side. &nbsp;Are you sure you want to set this as the condition that will complete the Quest?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“······ah. &nbsp;Ah. Ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The girl finally understood what was going on. &nbsp;Until a moment ago, she had thought this young magician was trying to steal her money. &nbsp;However, he was saying he would really find her dongsaeng in return for that coin!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even after thinking over it, the situation didn’t make any sense to her, so she wondered if he was lying. &nbsp;However, Artpe was looking at her with sincere eyes, so she couldn’t ask him if he was lying to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was why she decided to trust Artpe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“T...thank you very much! &nbsp;I...I don’t know how I should express my thanks….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can thank me after I find and return your dongsaeng safely to your side. &nbsp;I hope I’m not too late, but…...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe grinded his teeth as he took in the sight of the girl again. &nbsp;He activated his Read All Creation ability, and her status was revealed to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Aena]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Level : 1]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Curse : The process changing into low Class Magic Type Foreign Species 1%]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Drank water containing Cursed Mana four days ago.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Which son of a bitch did this…..’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Could a person be turned into a monster? &nbsp;The correct answer was yes. &nbsp;It was easy for corpses in places with negative Mana to come back as zombies or ghouls. &nbsp;Then there were voluntary methods that would allow one to become a Death Knight or a Lich.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Amongst the Curses, there were a decent amount that turned a subject into a monster. &nbsp;Currently, a curse that turned a person into a monster was placed on her. &nbsp;This was the most representative example of someone violating a human’s free will.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had expressed this sentiment before, but this was the type of nonsense he hated the most.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sound of his teeth grinding could be heard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As expected, Artpe is kind. &nbsp;You always told me ‘A person should always be precise in one’s calculations!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nope. &nbsp;My calculations were precise, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pi. &nbsp;Liar. &nbsp;Artpe is just embarrassed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe smirked as he started spouting bullshit towards Maetel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Listen well, Maetel. &nbsp;The value of an item is relative. &nbsp;Basically, if I think my calculation is correct, then it is correct.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was why the Quest Reward was important. If judged in an objective manner, even if something was worth a lot, it wouldn’t be worth much to him if it wasn’t something he needed. &nbsp;The balance in his calculation would be skewed. &nbsp;It was most definitely a tortuous way of thinking, but it was an absolute rule he followed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So what about you, Maetel?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe tapped his chest. &nbsp;It was the pocket where he put away the bronze coin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is 1 Bronze enough for you as a Quest Reward?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel looked into Artpe’s rage-filled eyes. &nbsp;She wondered why he was so angry. &nbsp;She thought maybe she’ll be able to find out the underlying reason if she carried out Aena’s request with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She always wanted a deeper understanding of Artpe. &nbsp;She was sure this request would move her a step closer to her goal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If she was able to do so, that was a reward in itself. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“·····Yes. &nbsp;It is more than enough.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All right. &nbsp;We’ll carry out the Quest at the same time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two held hands as they immediately rushed out of the room with Aena in the front. &nbsp;They arrived at a very small hut, and numerous townspeople were crowded inside the hut.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“M...magician-nim. &nbsp;In truth, my son was also…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My d….daughter was captured. &nbsp;Those soldiers took all of the nearby children saying they need to check thoroughly…….!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I beg of you, mage-nim. &nbsp;Please! &nbsp;Our children!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone had similar stories to Aena. &nbsp;When Maetel saw the crowd of people, she wondered why they hadn’t come along with Aena. &nbsp;Why had they remained outside? &nbsp;Maetel had a puzzled expression on her face, but Artpe already had a good grasp of this situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Aena was probably sent to them as a representative of the townspeople, who had lost their children. &nbsp;They wanted to make the request, but they were too afraid to meet with Artpe. &nbsp;This was why they had pushed forward the youngest and weakest amongst them to speak to Artpe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even amongst the weak, there was always someone that was weaker than the others. &nbsp;This was why people like them always insisted on sacrificing the weakest amongst them. &nbsp;When it looked as if Artpe had accepted the quest, they finally scrambled to meet him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe spoke firmly towards the townspeople surrounding him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want everything you guys own.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W...what? But you only wanted one bronze from Aena….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I received her entire net worth. &nbsp;I have to be fair in receiving the Quest Rewards. &nbsp;So are you going to request a Quest from me? &nbsp;Or maybe…. &nbsp;Shall I extract the price with my own hands?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone gathered at the location was struck dumb. &nbsp;They didn’t need to look at Artpe’s twisted smile to know that he was serious about his words. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>For some reason, the young mage was very angry right now, and if they were rash in provoking him, their missing children wouldn’t be the only problem they would face. &nbsp;The townspeople realized that they might be sent to a place where they would never be able to return from.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“U...understood!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ll bring it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone quickly ran into their homes. &nbsp;Artpe spat on the ground as he saw their backs, and he turned to look at Maetel. &nbsp;It looked as if she was still having a hard time completely understanding the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You would do well to watch this carefully. &nbsp;A crappy hero goes house to house to seize goods. &nbsp;A veteran hero like me makes the townspeople do my work instead.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“······Artpe looks like a really bad guy, but you look so cool that I like it anyways.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe wasn’t a veteran hero. &nbsp;He had merely been one of the Four Heavenly Kings in his past life yet he was shit talking in a confident manner. &nbsp;Maetel let out an opinion that was bit strange for a hero to say. &nbsp;When Aena looked at both of them with a dumbfounded expression, Artpe let out a bitter laugh as he asked her a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you have any clues as to where your dongsaeng was taken…. Of course, you don't.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. &nbsp;I just know that he was dragged away by the soldiers…....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Aena once again had tears in her eyes as she lowered her head. &nbsp;As if Artpe had expected this, he nodded his head. &nbsp;He easily organized the situation in his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This incident began when the heroes were born. &nbsp;The palace tried to acquire them, yet they had failed. &nbsp;This brought instability to the throne. &nbsp;This allowed the Archduke to be successful in his rebellion, and the throne was stolen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Archduke probably unleashed all the soldiers in this region to search for the runaway crown prince and the heroes. &nbsp;He might have mobilized all the soldiers inside the country. &nbsp;If he wanted to build a firm foundation for his power, the archduke had to kill the crown prince. &nbsp;If he wanted to gain legitimacy for the throne, he had to procure the heroes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe could somewhat see the natural flow of events. &nbsp;However, there were two problems that he couldn’t explain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>First, the soldiers were capturing all young children to check up on them. &nbsp;Secondly, Aena and maybe other children were being cursed through the drinking water. &nbsp;The curse placed on them would turn them into monsters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, these two problems might have nothing to do with each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Archduke might be doing a thorough job by gathering all the children. &nbsp;The girl might have been unlucky in having a curse placed on her. &nbsp;&nbsp;The curse might not have anything to do with the other captured children.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Still, I used to insist everything will go well before I suffered crushing defeats. &nbsp;I had enough of that in my days as one of the Four Heavenly King inside the Demon King’s army.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was why Artpe decided to assume the worst. &nbsp;It might not just be Aenea or the children of this town. &nbsp;Maybe, all the children in this country were cursed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He entertained the possibility of the people, who cursed the children, might have ties to the Archduke. &nbsp;They might be acting under his order.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If we are lucky, it might just be a simple black magician. &nbsp;If we are unlucky, it’ll be the Demon king’s army. &nbsp;If my past life is any indication, the Demon King didn’t use such a full-scale tactic at this point in time…...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He shouldn’t just take it for granted that something won’t happen, because it hadn’t happened in his past life. &nbsp;No, he had to be more vigilant for that eventuality.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, the world that had restarted thanks to his high rank ability didn’t exactly match up with his previous life. &nbsp;If he domineered over others by clinging to old memories, he might die an ignominious death that was befitting the weakest amongst the Four Heavenly Kings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’ll work under the assumption that there is a connection between the Archduke and the Demon King’s army. &nbsp;If so, I have a possible motive as to why the Archduke captured all the children of this town. &nbsp;The Demon King’s army may have used this opportunity to infect the children with the curse, and they are using the soldiers to collect them….’</span></p>
 <p><span style>What were they planning to do with the children, who were turned into monsters? &nbsp;He didn’t even need to ask that question. &nbsp;The general population would fall into chaos, so the Demon King’s army would have achieved its goal. &nbsp;Anything that happened afterwards was a bonus.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That means….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe looked at Aena, and he thought how unlikely all of this was. &nbsp;If they hadn’t come to this town… &nbsp;No, if he hadn’t frightened away the soldiers, it would have been Aena’s turn to be taken away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There weren’t any cursed children left in the town besides Aena. &nbsp;If she wasn’t here, he wouldn’t have been so aggressive in jumping into this matter. &nbsp;He wouldn’t have budged no matter what anyone would have said to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Basically, a small flame he had created at a whim had turned into this Quest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“....so this is what it like to be a hero.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe shut his eyes as he mumbled to himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he researched the progress of the hero in the past, he had wondered why trouble seemed to follow the hero. &nbsp;Now that he was the person directly involved in the matter, everything was falling into place. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had no more excuses. &nbsp;Their actions forged the future. &nbsp;It sounded as if he was using circular reasoning…. &nbsp;Ah, it couldn’t be. &nbsp;He probably wasn’t.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, it became noisy outside. &nbsp;The townspeople had brought their ‘entire fortune’</span></p>
 <p><span style>“M...magician-nim! &nbsp;We brought it all! &nbsp;This really is all our fortune!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It really is tough to make a living these days, so this is all we have. &nbsp;We are telling you the truth….!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Will you really find my child just from receiving this? &nbsp;I feel ashamed to say this is all we have….·!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When everyone gathered, Artpe opened his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t plan on going through all the stuff brought to him by the people. &nbsp;He just wanted to punk them for their disgraceful behaviors. &nbsp;He planned on saving the blameless children from the start. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, he couldn’t outwardly express such an attitude.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You should all give your thanks to Aena. &nbsp;You were too scared to meet me even though your children were captured. &nbsp;If it wasn’t for Aena’s bravery, I wouldn’t have cared if your children died or not.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The townspeople flinched at his venomous words. &nbsp;His words also struck a nerve. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>It should be enough to bring them to their senses. &nbsp;He hoped it was so.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All right. &nbsp;After this, I’ll include all of you as clients. &nbsp;I’ll return your children… &nbsp;Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was indifferently gathering all the ‘fortunes’ gathered by the townspeople when he saw a black pebble amongst the items. &nbsp;His eyes widened. &nbsp;A village woman flinched, and she spoke as if she was giving an excuse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“M...my husband found it in the past! &nbsp;It was so pretty that I was hoping it was an expensive gem….. &nbsp;I’m sorry! &nbsp;I’m sorry!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe firmly shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is no way this is a gem, ajumma.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m sorry! &nbsp;I’m really sorry! &nbsp;Please my son….!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe had a twisted smile on his lips as he picked it up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t know if it was fate or inevitability. &nbsp;It might be either, but….. &nbsp;Ah ah. &nbsp;This was quite fun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Its outer appearance looks like a gem, but this is something much more important. &nbsp;Rejoice, ajumma.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You saved all the children.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Obsidian of Greed]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Rank A]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[A magical stone that sucks in all curses. &nbsp;If it contains a curse, it doesn’t differentiate between Mana or a physical object. &nbsp;It absorbs and stores the curse. &nbsp;It can be used as activation ingredient for certain special curse magic. &nbsp;The amount of curse and the quality of curses will determine how much of a boos the magic spell will receive. &nbsp;Currently, the stone is empty.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe’s purple eyes confirmed the true nature of the black stone, and he once again let out a laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t care who was pulling the strings to this plot. &nbsp;The idea of thoroughly crushing all of them made him so happy that he couldn’t stop his laughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the first sortie for the rotten hero.</span></p>
