 <p>Chapter 12 - Growth of the Heroes (4)</p>
 <p><span style>[I’ve already acknowledged…. &nbsp;Kuhk!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[We’ll back off for now, and the others will test….!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I told you I won't let you guys run awayyyyyyyyy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe’s Mana was being shared with Maetel, and she was like a predator that didn’t get tired.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Skeletons couldn’t gauge Maetel’s ability using her level. &nbsp;Still, &nbsp;they managed to come to the right decision. &nbsp;They expressed their intent on giving up on the battle. &nbsp;However, it was way too late to do so. &nbsp;Maetel’s rage refused to diminish when she saw their shameless behavior. &nbsp;It actually increased it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You guys originally planned on killing Artpe! &nbsp;Now you want to admit defeat and retreat? &nbsp;You guys are mean. &nbsp;You are all very mean! &nbsp;I almost lost Artpe! &nbsp;You guys want to end this with just a single speech! &nbsp;You guys are really really mean!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[There’s no point. &nbsp;We told you there is no point in going further than this!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The hero’s rage… &nbsp;Your rage will put you on a path of no return…..]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You guys are the one, who will be put on a path of no return! &nbsp;Eeyahhhh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When one saw Maetel’s outer appearance, one would assume she’ll have a hard time lifting the huge bastard sword. &nbsp;However, the sword was moving freely in the hands of Maetel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The white blade didn’t discriminate between vertical and horizontal swings. &nbsp;She was like a salmon wading up a fierce current. &nbsp;She mercilessly sliced and crushed the bodies of the Skeletons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fortunately, she still had enough awareness to realize that she must not kill any of them. &nbsp;She was basically holding onto a single thread of her reason.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was something very hard to do even for Berserkers, who lived many years alongside their rage. &nbsp;However, Maetel was doing it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are running around wildly like an idiot…...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe recovered his Mana, and he focused on sharing it with Maetel. &nbsp;Of course, Artpe’s Mana was on a different class compared to Maetel’s Mana. &nbsp;&nbsp;Even after supplying Mana required to sustain Maetel’s Berserk state, he was still overflowing with Mana. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he became somewhat confident in maintaining the link, he gathered the sharp bone fragments in his surrounding. &nbsp;As he maintained the Mana link with her, he strengthened the bone fragments with Mana. &nbsp;Then he started attacking them from distance. &nbsp;Each throw incapacitated a Skeleton. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The two heroes once again started an airtight attack. &nbsp;They were facing a group of enemies that had increased in size by several dozen magnitude!</span></p>
 <p><span style>[I have no idea what is going on.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Why are there two heroes? &nbsp;Did these two really show up in the same era?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Our role is to conduct the test. &nbsp;That is it. &nbsp;It is our duty to guide them to the next location then we will back off.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[However, at this rate….]</span></p>
 <p><span style>She dismantled the limbs of the most talkative Skeleton first. &nbsp;Maetel’s bastard sword was swung like a club, and she sent the disabled Skeletons into the corner of the hallway.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a pile consisting of 90 Skeletons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe made sure the Skeletons couldn't recover. &nbsp;He mainly used his shield to dice them up. &nbsp;The shield was connected to Artpe by a strap reinforced by Mana, and it freely sliced through the air. &nbsp;It was like a boomerang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[This is like….]</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the two heroes continued their dominance, a particular Skeleton was hit by Maetel’s sword on its cheek bone. &nbsp;It let out a groan that wasn’t actually a groan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[It is as if we are the ones being tested.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[This runs contrary to the point of this test.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Thus.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[We will make changes.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh man. &nbsp;What is it again…. &nbsp;Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the Mana density within the Dungeon suddenly increased.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The hallway rolled as it widened. &nbsp;It became unfathomably large. &nbsp;Then he felt the Undead Mana from the other side increase in an uncontrolled manner. &nbsp;&nbsp;The walls kept contracting than expanding, and the flow of Mana within the Dungeon quickened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kyahhh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>An enormous change was occurring to the entire Dungeon. &nbsp;Maetel was taken aback. &nbsp;She broke out of the effects of her Berserk skill, and she turned to look at Artpe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is going on, Artpe…..?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...I get it now. &nbsp;I’ve been firmly under a delusion.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wasn't like Maetel. &nbsp;He wasn’t afraid of the unknown. &nbsp;Before one knew it, a smile had appeared on Artpe’s lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If a Demon, who was much more proficient in magic than him was here, this Demon would have realized it much earlier. &nbsp;However, it couldn’t be helped, since he was the weakest amongst the Four Heavenly Kings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, he had realized it before it was too late. &nbsp;That would be enough. &nbsp;He could straighten this out. &nbsp;This was what the power possessed by Artpe was for.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The change of the Dungeon is ongoing. &nbsp;No, the Dungeon itself is trapped within a magic spell.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Who labeled this as a beginner’s Dungeon? &nbsp;This Dungeon had been made to look sloppy on purpose. &nbsp;This was a genuine Dungeon. &nbsp;This couldn’t have been formed naturally, and it wasn’t something a regular person could make.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[We give the test.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[If they are better… &nbsp;If they are more extraordinary… &nbsp;If they are overpowered… &nbsp;If they are geniuses...]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[We will send out everyone. &nbsp;We just have to test them again.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sound of marching could be heard. &nbsp;Several dozen level 50 Skeletons appeared from down the hallway. &nbsp;&nbsp;There were countless number of Skeletons readied behind them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They came from the front, back, left and right. &nbsp;The hallway kept expanding, and it broke down the walls and stairways. &nbsp;The dead sleeping below were all awoken.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every one of them were connected through the Record Link.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a very severe ordeal for beginner hero, who barely eclipsed level 30. &nbsp;However, she just fixed the grip on her bastard sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’ll be alright, Artpe. &nbsp;I'll protect you. &nbsp;I’ll crush them all. &nbsp;”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her emerald colored eyes didn't shake at all. &nbsp;She was too brilliant and strong to be seen as a mere 12 year old girl.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ah ah. &nbsp;Maybe this was the point where she would open her eyes as a true hero. &nbsp;Artpe grinned when he saw this, and he raised his gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. &nbsp;Someone had planned all of this. &nbsp;I don’t know which era this person was from…...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Skeletons kept bringing up the subject of heroes. &nbsp;At this point, they were acting in a brutal and annoying manner as if they were bullies. &nbsp;Aside from their actions, he was sure they wanted to check the qualification of the heroes. &nbsp;This gave him a good idea, who might have designed this Dungeon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll crush you all so thoroughly that you won't be able to be recycled. &nbsp;I’ll take everything that is yours.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His purple eyes contained the power of the Read All Creation ability. &nbsp;His eyes let out a light as he surveyed his surrounding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A large scale ancient magic was protecting the entirety of the Dungeon. &nbsp;Their level of power wouldn’t be able to do anything against it. &nbsp;It was a magic spell that changed depending on the situation. &nbsp;It changed to put the challengers up against a wall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was why it was time for Artpe to step forward. &nbsp;This was why they stood a chance of succeeding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Every magic has a structure, and all structures have weaknesses. &nbsp;Of course, it’ll be difficult to instantaneously drive a wedge between the magic spell to break it…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This magic continuously acted on a large space, and if even one thing went out of whack, the spell would come crumbling down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, it was known amongst mages that it was impossible to find the structure and the cracks within an ever changing magic spell. This widely accepted idea was turned on its head when Artpe Hirtana Kelduke of the Four Heavenly Kings appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Artpe’s name wasn’t known to those in this era. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was why no magic had yet been prepared to counteract against Artpe!</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Huh? &nbsp;Wait a moment. &nbsp;What happened to the me that should exist right now in this era? &nbsp;Am I absent or was I swapped with someone else? &nbsp;If that isn’t the case, then….’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In a flash, he had a terrifying idea, but this wasn’t the time to mull over those thoughts. &nbsp;He shook his head to expel all thoughts unrelated to their survival. &nbsp;Afterwards, he checked up on Maetel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ooh-ohhhhhhhhhhhh! &nbsp;I can do this! &nbsp;I can do this!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Koo-gah-ahhhhhhhk!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel didn’t back down from the Skeletons coming from all sides. &nbsp;She ran wild. &nbsp;Artpe’s reserve of Mana was too vast compared to his level, so her Mana usage didn’t even make a dent in his Mana supply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She didn’t know how to retreat, and she had no fear. &nbsp;Instead of shying away from the large number, she harassed them. &nbsp;&nbsp;She restricted the movement of the Skeletons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as if she had been trained in personal and group battles for several dozen years. &nbsp;She was adept at it. &nbsp;The fact that she was doing all of this on instinct was the most startling fact in all of this. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won’t back away…. &nbsp;&nbsp;I won’t forgive you guys….!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Koo-ahhhhhhk!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[We need more! &nbsp;There aren’t enough of us!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Above all, her sword strikes were slowly getting sharper and heavier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Aside from the need to maintain the Berserk and the Bone Gauntlet, she wasn’t using any Mana. She was able to lightly dodge the Skeletons' swords, which were infused with their Mana. &nbsp;Each of her sword swing were able to crush the bones of opponents, who were 20 levels higher.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She made a lie of the common phrase that said a difference in level meant a difference in battle capability. &nbsp;Currently, a hero had been born on this continent, and she was easily jumping over her limits. &nbsp;It was as if she was mocking those who had to live within the restriction of levels.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if the Skeletons increased in number, they couldn’t overcome against a single slender girl. &nbsp;They grudgingly had to acknowledge her growth, and they despaired.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Strong······ She shouldn’t be &nbsp;this strong, yet she is too powerful. &nbsp;In a situation where she should be retreating, she chose to charge straight ahead!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[She shouldn’t be allowed to grow right now, so why is she growing stronger!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Maetel]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Level - 32]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Swordsmanship Lv7]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Battle Step Lv6]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Perception Lv8]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why? &nbsp;Her skills have increased.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was genius, who learned the Berserk skill after getting a taste of the Bone Gauntlet’s buff effect. &nbsp;She was in the early level 30s, yet she had achieved level 7 on a weapon skill. &nbsp;&nbsp;Achievements such as these were no longer surprising.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe checked and confirmed that Maetel was barely receiving any wounds. &nbsp;He determined he didn’t need to monitor her constantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“For a little while, you should hold them off by yourself, Maetel. &nbsp;I think I’ll be able to change our situation by a little bit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I believe in Artpe. &nbsp;Artpe can do it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if he hadn’t received her encouragement, he was confident he could do this… &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, he felt a surge of energy from somewhere, and he wondered if the Link magic was the cause.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright. &nbsp;Trust in me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe lifted the corner of his mouth. &nbsp;As he laughed, he raised both his hands. &nbsp;The shield connected to the Mana strap rose into the air, and it started revolving around his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if he wasn’t able to inflict the curse unto the Skeletons, it was still possible for him to defend again their attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If a powerful magic spell was the only thing important about a mage, he would be called by the name of his strongest magic. &nbsp;However, there was a reason why mages don’t use that naming convention. &nbsp;The distinct name of a mage and their various talent they possess has importance…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A mage’s true worth didn’t come out when facing a single enemy using fire or ice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A single gesture could change the tide of battle. &nbsp;A mage was only recorded in history when one could change the direction of the battle by oneself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see it. &nbsp;I can see everything. &nbsp;I know where I’ll have to tweak…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dungeon was trying to compensate for the fact that there were two heroes. &nbsp;The standard requirement for this Dungeon was for one challenger, so the Dungeon was merging into a single floor to contend with them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These Skeletons were only at level 50, but the ones afterwards would be higher in level. &nbsp;Moreover, they would also be connected through the Record Link.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It would be the end if he let that happen. &nbsp;Even if Maetel was a genius who could ignore level differences, there was a limit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What should he do? &nbsp;He had sufficiently strengthened the abilities of Maetel. &nbsp;It would also be impossible for Artpe to personally grow right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was why he had to turn the enemies and the battlefield on its head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If this was a regular structure, this should be impossible to do. &nbsp;However, the entire Dungeon is being controlled by a spell, so this is a different situation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe’s purple eyes shone as they started to let out an odd luminescence. &nbsp;He could see all the Mana flowing from the Dungeon’s wall, hallway and ceiling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He could see where they met, and he saw how it curved to change the structure of the Dungeon. &nbsp;He also could see how the Mana was being used over the monsters!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had found it. &nbsp;Mana threads shot out from the tips of Artpe’s ten fingers. &nbsp;The Skeletons knew he was up to no good, but they also knew that they were lacking in ability to be able to touch the boy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the damnedest thing. &nbsp;Before Artpe stepped forward, he had made thorough preparations. &nbsp;No one would be able to interfere with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the result of the struggle of trying to escape the fact of being the weakest amongst the Four Heavenly Kings! &nbsp;He had always been sacrificed first before. &nbsp;However, he had had transitioned into being a hero now. &nbsp;The results he had gained from before was bearing fruit in a brilliant manner!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is easier than establishing the Mana Link. &nbsp;The fact that I can see your magic should be a terrifying reality for you guys…. &nbsp;&nbsp;I’ll show it to you now. &nbsp;”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The 10 strands of Mana Threads from his fingers extended out towards the surrounding. &nbsp;The Mana Threads reached specific locations on the Dungeon’s hallway, ceiling and floor. &nbsp;Then the sharp ends of the Mana Thread started to bore in. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The vibration that was shaking the Dungeon became worse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Here, here and there…...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[W...what are you doing!?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Do you really think such a weak move could sever our connection!? Impossible! &nbsp;That is impossible!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are right. &nbsp;It is impossible. &nbsp;I’ve barely reached level 30, and it isn’t as if I can cancel such a fucking old and large magic spell.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, there was one thing he could do.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe let out an evil smile as he swung his two hands. &nbsp;The 10 Mana Threads undulated as they surged towards the wall, hallway and ceiling.&nbsp; They were absorbed into various locations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[······?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[There was a change... &nbsp;No, there wasn’t any change….?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dungeon stopped shaking. &nbsp;The ever-expanding hallway stopped expanding, and no new Skeletons appeared..</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dungeon walls, which had disappeared, started to slowly grow back. &nbsp;The out of control Mana within the Dungeon calmed a little bit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Artpe… &nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing has changed?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, Maetel. &nbsp;You made the correct observation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe waved his hand at his surrounding. &nbsp;The protective shield, which had been revolving around him, shot out towards a group of Skeletons. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Until a moment ago, new Skeletons had appeared every time when a group went down. &nbsp;It was an attempt to tire out the two heroes. &nbsp;However, one could no longer see the reinforcements.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah. &nbsp;This is….!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Can it be….]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Our connection to our comrades on the other side was severed. &nbsp;Our magic was reduced by the Dungeon’s power! &nbsp;This means he manipulated the magic spell…. &nbsp;My god. &nbsp;How could such a young child do this!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel quickly realized what had occurred. &nbsp;The Skeletons were a step late in realizing it, and they started to talk noisily amongst themselves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe had expanded his magical senses, and he had encased the current hallway and the several hundred Skeletons within it. &nbsp;He spoke in a confident manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothing will change from now on. &nbsp;Your reinforcements won’t be coming.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as if the reinforcement were gone. &nbsp;It wasn’t an easy task to erase one’s enemies from the face of this world using pure Mana.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes, they were still alive. Even now they were probably stamping their feet as they waited for their turn to come.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, they would be waiting on the Dungeon’s next floor, which won’t open until all the Skeletons here were killed.</span></p>
