 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Aedia had sent out magicians to ascertain the extent of power possessed by Artpe’s party, but they had lost contact with all the magicians. &nbsp;This was why the only thing known about Artpe’s party was its size.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was also the reason why they had declared this the worst crisis since the founding of Aedia as a nation.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The defense facilities installed all over Aedia are too good that they’ve never experienced their capital being ransacked by enemy forces. Of course, they have a procedure to deal with an attack on the captial. &nbsp;They possess evacuation sites.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Artpe, do we have to kill the civilians?”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is there a way to subdue our enemies without clashing against them?”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll be going first. &nbsp;You guys should follow me at a slower pace. &nbsp;You can be at ease. &nbsp;I’ll take care of the magicians along the way.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In truth, a magician of Artpe’s level should have learned the Flight spell by now. &nbsp;No, it was more befitting for him to use teleportation spells at his level. &nbsp;However, movement type spells refused to drop for him. &nbsp;This was why he was thankful for the fact that he was able to learn the Float spell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the end, he could only put his trust in Mycenae now. &nbsp;However, he hadn’t met her in awhile, because he had been playing underwater. When he solved the Forest of Eternity quest for her, he would use it as leverage to acquire spell books from her. &nbsp;He planned on being forceful in his request.</span></p>
