 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The previous Demon King had never became fully cognizant of Artpe. &nbsp;Not even for a moment. &nbsp;She had been released from her seal after Artpe had died. &nbsp;After the world started anew, she spent most of the time trying to fully free herself from the nasty seal that had been placed on her. &nbsp;She didn’t have the time to pay attention to others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her power had been weakened by the seal, so she was still recovering her power. &nbsp;This was why she hadn’t stepped forward onto the stage. &nbsp;However, she could no longer delay in making an appearance. &nbsp;She had to act. &nbsp;Of course, the previous Demon King and Nanarai Bodra was the core power of her faction. &nbsp;The two of them made up over 90% of the power possessed by her faction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[I am the Demon King, who inherited the blood of the Demonic god. &nbsp;My name is Garnet Orzodia. I know you’ve killed my poor successor. &nbsp;However, I’m very lenient when it comes to a cute child. &nbsp;Did you say your name was Artpe? &nbsp;You don’t have to be lost any more. &nbsp;You should return to the Demon race. &nbsp;I’ll hold you in my bosom.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her gaze was fixed on Artpe. &nbsp;She knew that Artpe was the backbone of the hero’s party. &nbsp;She knew that Artpe was the one that had a hand in growing his party members to this extent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Above all else, he was manifesting a spell through his staff and magic tome! &nbsp;He was turning the Demon realm into the human realm, and her Demon underlings had been turned into humans. He was someone with overwhelming power! &nbsp;She had lost everyone that had acted as her hands and feet. &nbsp;Even as she surveyed her enemies, she was thinking about how to bring him under her as an underling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[I’ll tell you this now. &nbsp;It is meaningless to go against me. &nbsp;My existence is a miracle in itself. &nbsp;I am this world’s first and the last! &nbsp;I am the proof that the Demonic god exists. &nbsp;I am his daughter. &nbsp;I do not want to kill you. &nbsp;That is why you should walk towards me of your own volition. &nbsp;You should embrace me. &nbsp;I do not lie.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Each word you speak is dripping with Demonic energy. &nbsp;That means….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Artpe maintained his spell as he took in the sight of her. &nbsp;His Read All Creation ability did a great job in delivering her information to him.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Artpe’s party had acted too fast, so she had come out before she had regained her full power. &nbsp;Despite this fact, it was as she boasted. &nbsp;She was plenty strong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It burned for Artpe to admit this, but he had to acknowledge that the current Demon King had been right once again. &nbsp;Artpe’s party had to go through the experience of fighting the current Demon King and the fragment of the Demonic god. &nbsp;If they hadn’t, they wouldn’t have stood a chance against Garnet Orzodia.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“She is level 419. &nbsp;However, she had been sealed. &nbsp;She’s been weakened significantly after she was released from the seal. &nbsp;We just have to do the same thing we did against the current Demon King and the fragment of the Demonic god.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Artpe always speaks as if it'll be easy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The previous Demon King was a terrifying monster. &nbsp;However, he had already expected this when her existence was alluded to. &nbsp; The only thing his party needed right now was determination.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Maetel and Sienna moved to the front. &nbsp;The rest of the party slowly moved backwards as they got in formation. &nbsp;Regina raised her staff in order to protect all of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[It'll be futile even if everyone attacks me all at once. &nbsp;Will it be ok sending out only the two of them? &nbsp;Moreover, you are maintaining the great magic.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t listen to that woman’s words. &nbsp;Her Innate ability is called Seduction. &nbsp;It is a technique that can make a hero into an idiot. &nbsp;In fact, that idiot is right over there.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Oh my. &nbsp;You are quite the cold-hearted child. &nbsp;I haven’t told you the name of my ability, yet you spoke it out loud. &nbsp;It feels as if you’ve undressed me. &nbsp;Aren’t you progressing too fast in make a move on me?]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m killing that woman for sure.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“······since she is raising your fighting spirit, I won’t say anything.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nanarai Bodra was letting out a powerful Demonic energy as he hovered near Garnet Orzodia. &nbsp;It was as if he was trying to protect her. &nbsp;His nose flared as he looked at her. &nbsp;It was a really pathetic sight, but his behavior was in line with his past image.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[If it wasn’t for you, I wouldn’t have been able to unravel her seal. &nbsp;As the level and the quality of the subject being sealed increases, it becomes harder to break the seal.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You are the one that had placed the seal, yet you weren’t able to unseal it. &nbsp;It validates my idea that you’ve lost a significant portion of your memories.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They no longer needed to listen to Nanarai Bodra. &nbsp;Above all else, they had to stop Garnet Orzodia before she talked any more. &nbsp;Did Etna share a hive mind with Artpe? &nbsp;Etna immediately attacked Nanarai Bodra.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[I’m sorry, but you cannot kill this man until we achieve what we desire…. &nbsp;Hoohp!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The previous Demon King immediately moved to block Etna. &nbsp;However, Sienna had followed up behind Etna. &nbsp;She brought her hammer down, and the hammer crushed the spot where Garnet Orzodia had occupied. &nbsp;Sienna was also a heavy weight that was over level 400!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sienna wasn’t the hero. &nbsp;Garnet Orzodia never expected someone in the hero’s party other than the heroes to possess so much power, so she dodged in surprise. &nbsp;However, her surprise didn’t end there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[What’s going on······ Ah, ahhhhhh.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[You are a thorn in my side!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Nanarai saw Garnet’s torment, he let out a shout in anger. &nbsp;His gaze was planted squarely on Artpe. &nbsp;To be precise, he was looking at the small white bell that was swinging slowly in Artpe’s hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[I’ve never heard of such an Artifact!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright. &nbsp;He took the bait, Etna!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Roger!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Artpe was successful in baiting the idiot! &nbsp;Flame coated Etna’s entire body, and she charged straight towards Nanarai Bodra.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She possessed a peerless Innate ability that was geared towards combat. &nbsp;Nanarai Bodra was being weakened by the Declaration of Demonic Extermination, so Etna was on par with him! Moreover, Nanarai was adept at dealing with magic. &nbsp;He was having a hard time countering attacks made through the power of a Fire Spirit. &nbsp;He could do nothing as he allowed Etna to damage his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[It can’t be helped. &nbsp;Since you guys are being so violent and unreasonable……. &nbsp; It’ll hurt a little bit, but you should endure it. &nbsp;Afterwards, I’ll have plenty of time to soothe your pain away.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Garnet Orzodia gritted her teeth. &nbsp;The Declaration of Demonic Extermination kept ringing, and it felt as if her head would be split open. &nbsp;However, it was merely an Artifact. &nbsp;How could she be called the conqueror of the Demonic realm if she couldn’t even overcome a single Artifact!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Maetel and Sienna had raised their weapons as they glared at Garnet. &nbsp;Garnet raised her hand towards the two girls. &nbsp;Without any warning, magic missile erupted from Garnet’s hand, and the spell attacked the two girls. &nbsp;The magic missiles were a light attack, yet it was too powerful to be ignored!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If we dodge, Artpe will be hurt!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is gonna hurt more than a little bit······!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The profound power of Acceleration was added to Maetel’s sword strike. &nbsp;She quickly cut through the magic missiles. &nbsp;Sienna blocked the fragments of the magic missiles with her shield. Garnet had planned up on moving in close after she had fired her magic missiles. &nbsp;However, Maetel’s single sword strike continued to split through the air. &nbsp;The strike was infused with Mana, and it flew straight towards Garnet. &nbsp;She quickly moved to dodge it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t touch Artpe!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As if it was inevitable, Garnet raised her arm to block Maetel’s sword strike.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[You aren’t just a cute child······!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Since you are really old, I can see why you are looking for cute things.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Ho-oh.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Maetel’s provocation was successful! &nbsp;Garnet moved in very close to Maetel as she detonated her Demonic energy. &nbsp;She tried to attack Maetel, but it was too late. &nbsp;Sienna had gotten close, and she pushed Garnet with her shield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sienna had given up on directly attacking Garnet. &nbsp;She was just trying to protect Maetel with her shield. &nbsp;She was trying to create an opportunity where Maetel would be able to attack Garnet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[You magical energy is unique······?]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Unni, I’ll leave it to you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes. &nbsp;I’ll protect Artpe.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Maetel took the Mana of an Evil Reflector from Sienna. She infused it within her sword. &nbsp;In the nick of time, Vadinet’s blessing was placed over the two girls. &nbsp;At the same time, Vadinet’s curse hit Garnet. &nbsp;The tide of battle changed in an instant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[This is an annoyingly familiar sight. &nbsp;In the past, Nanarai stressed the importance of his comrades in front of me….. &nbsp;However, he is mine now!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Garnet moved, countless magic missles formed in her wake. &nbsp;Garnet didn’t have an Innate ability like the dead current Demon King. &nbsp;However, she was able to mentally subjugate other using her Seduction ability. &nbsp;On top of that, she possessed a massive reservoir of Demonic energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Simple plans didn’t work against her. &nbsp;One couldn’t simply attack her weak point. &nbsp;In many aspects, she really was the prototypical Demon King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[The magic missiles are weakening······!?]</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, even she was weakened in front of the Declaration of Demonic Extermination being rung by Artpe!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[We have to destroy that bell!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[You do it, Nanarai! &nbsp;I’ll······ I have to entertain these brats!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Maetel started using her Record Master ability in earnest. &nbsp;She gathered the power of her party into herself. &nbsp;Maetel’s skill had evolved in the process of fighting the Demon King and the fragment of the Demonic god.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her ability had moved beyond gathering the abilities of her party members. &nbsp;The power maximized Maetel’s attack, and as soon Sienna tried to defend and counter attack, the power was transferred to her. &nbsp;Her skill was maximizing each other’s abilities to the extreme.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Garnet could see the Record being transferred between the two girls, so she tried to attack at the exact moment when the transfer happened. &nbsp;Surprisingly, Maetel was too mobile, and she was aware of Garnet’s intention. &nbsp;Maetel didn’t give Garnet the chance to exploit the weakness in her skill. &nbsp;Garnet gritted her teeth as she met Maetel’s flashing eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[You bitch······!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m sorry, but there will be no stage for you beyond this. &nbsp;Everything will end here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The bastard sword contained her indomitable will. &nbsp;It let out a white light. &nbsp;It was Hero’s Flash.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’ll have to exit this stage.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other side, Nanarai Bodra was in a worse situation than the Demon King. &nbsp;Etna was the only one in the party that was capable of going toe to toe with Artpe and Maetel! &nbsp;This was before she had gained her Spirit Transformation ability. &nbsp;Now she was a foe that couldn’t be pushed around by Nanarai Bodra.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Is this perhaps the power of a Spirit? &nbsp;Yes, my arm was…..! &nbsp;You are a cute woman, yet you are quite rough!]</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Enta punched the air, and tens of thousands of Fire Birds erupted from her fist. &nbsp;In a flash, she created an area filled with lava. &nbsp;Nanarai tried to manifest his Demonic energy into a spell, but it was burned away by the fire before he could do that. &nbsp;At that moment, Etna was as close to being the epitome of her fire attribute.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[If you think I’ll continue to suffer under your attack, you are mistaken!]</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In multiple instances, Etna had prevented Nanarai Bodra from activating his spells . &nbsp;He had the body of a Demon, yet he suffered from horrifying burns. &nbsp;He couldn’t heal from these burns. &nbsp;In the end, he gave up on manifesting his spells through Demonic energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, this was when the true battle started. &nbsp;He quickly swung his one remaining hand. &nbsp;It was similar to what the Demon King Garnet had done. &nbsp;However, magic missiles of a fundamentally different nature started to pour out. &nbsp;The magic missiles couldn’t be compared in the quantity of power they possessed, but surprisingly, magic circles had been nested within the magic missiles. &nbsp;When the flames touched the magic missiles, the magic circle within was activated! &nbsp;It ate the flames!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[I don’t know how long you’ve been with the hero, but I’ve walked down the road of a magician before I became a Demon. &nbsp;I was peerless.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[You were overtaken by Artpe in terms of magic.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Etna snorted. &nbsp;She was a bit disheartened, since she couldn’t read the spell that was nested within the magic circle. &nbsp;However, she couldn’t outwardly display her disappointment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘I have to be more wary of this man than the Demon King. &nbsp;The one that is working on the Demonification of the human realm isn’t the previous Demon King. &nbsp;It should be this man….!’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even as Nanaria Bodra fought against Etna, he kept glancing towards Artpe’s Reclamation magic. &nbsp;This might be a ridiculous idea, but he might be deciphering the Reclamation magic in real time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[I got you.]</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even during a battle, Etna was focused on Artpe. Her attention was divided. &nbsp;Etna didn't see the magic missile coming towards her. &nbsp;She only realized its presence when it hit her body. &nbsp;Of course, she thought the flame coating her body would block the magic missile…..</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Koo-hahk!?”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The flame around Etna’s body disappeared. &nbsp;Etna’s body shook as she fell to the ground. &nbsp;Artpe had been injecting his Mana into the magic tome. &nbsp;He looked up in shock. &nbsp;At that moment, he saw something that he hadn’t been able to see before.</span></p>
