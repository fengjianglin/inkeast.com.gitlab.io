 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a flash, Artpe became dumbfounded. &nbsp;He mumbled to himself. &nbsp;He thought his eyes were playing tricks on him, so he rubbed his eyes before he looked at the Demon King again. &nbsp;However, he could still see the shackles around the Demon King’s neck. &nbsp;It was the Absolute Control, which had allowed the Demon King to subjugate his underlings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[An already completed spell can once again change its shape…. &nbsp;You got me this time. &nbsp;I admit it.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Demon King mumbled to himself as he rubbed at his neck. &nbsp;An amazing amount of Demonic energy made the collar turn faint. &nbsp;In the end, the collar was gone. &nbsp;However, Artpe possessed the Read All Creation ability, and he could clearly see the trace left behind by the collar. &nbsp;The collar wasn’t completely gone. &nbsp;It just spoke to the reality that the Demon King was resisting against the shackles placed on him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As expected, monsters over level 400 were able to resist against the power of Absolute Control. &nbsp;However, it wasn’t the time to have such idle thoughts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[There are constraints to using Absolute Control. &nbsp;I’m right, aren’t I?]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[······.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even the Read All Creation ability had a tough time seeing through to the true nature of an Innate ability. &nbsp;However, clues had been presented in front of his eyes. &nbsp;If he couldn’t figure this out, Artpe deserved to die.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[If you are able to win against your opponent, you are able to control them. &nbsp;However, if you lose, the opposite happens. &nbsp;You will become subjugated to the winner. &nbsp;You lost to the previous Demon King, so you are subjugated to him.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[You were able to discern everything in such a short amount of time. &nbsp;However, this is my Innate ability. &nbsp;As you can see, it is merely an ability that I can control.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Demon King was lying. &nbsp;The Absolute Control was a peerless skill, but as a price, its owner couldn't control it. &nbsp;It was a dangerous ability. &nbsp;In short, it &nbsp;was a powerful magic, but it was like a nasty curse that can turn on its user if it wasn’t successfully used against one’s enemy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Demon King was using his massive reservoir of Demonic energy to resist against the Innate ability. &nbsp;However, he could only loosen the shackles. &nbsp;He couldn’t escape it. &nbsp;Of course, a huge portion of his power was tied up right now in order to resist against his shackles. &nbsp;The fact that he still had this much Demonic energy left was frightening, but….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘Did he make this stage to orchestrate his own death?’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Artpe met eyes with the Demon King. &nbsp;Artpe wanted to read the Demon King’s intent, but he once again realized that it was useless. &nbsp;He decided there was no reason to pussyfoot around this. &nbsp;The Read All Creation ability could’t read thoughts. &nbsp;Artpe just had to push a bit harder, and he was sure he’ll be able to find out the Demon King’s intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He is in a weakened state right now. &nbsp;We have to defeat him right now!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ok!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Understood!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn’t bother giving an explanation. &nbsp;He just delivered a correct assessment of an enemy that had to be defeated! &nbsp;The flustered Demon King once again poured out a fierce wave of Demonic energy. &nbsp;However, Maetel and Sienna just shrugged off the Demonic energy. &nbsp;They charged towards the Demon King! &nbsp;Maetel ran through the storm of Demonic energy, and she raised her long sword high into the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bash!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a simple Bash skill, but there was a light encasing her sword. &nbsp;It was the advanced spell form of the Hero’s Aura called the Hero Flash. &nbsp;All of the power within her spell was infused into a normal, yet high quality bastard sword. &nbsp;It became akin to a holy word. &nbsp;The Demon King glared at her as he faced her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[It seems level isn’t the only thing you’ve improved on!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The fight with you······ I can finish it now!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The light and the Demonic energy ran amok as they covered the nearby premise. &nbsp;Sienna used this opportunity to bring down her hammer. &nbsp;The Demon King quickly teleported, and the Demon King’s chair was destroyed instead. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The fight will start for real now. &nbsp;I can hear his heartbeat quicken.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I remember it······ Hoo-ooooh.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The only one that had an inherent advantage over the Demon King in terms of attribute was Etna. &nbsp;Aside from ice, her flame could burn everything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Demon King’s heart quickened, because it was the source of his existence. &nbsp;A fatally poisonous Demonic energy was pumped out of his heart, and it dispersed from his back. &nbsp;It was as if he had wings made out of poisonous vapor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[You think too much, my lovely puppet. &nbsp;It seems your magic is no longer as sharp when aiming for my neck. &nbsp;It seems your heart is moving before your hands.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[What a load of bullshit. &nbsp;If that is true, does your mouth move before your Demonic energy?]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Reclamation magic was already on the rise. &nbsp;Part of the Demon King’s Demonic energy had already been purified. &nbsp;Artpe’s party just had to push him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll block all of his Demonic energy, so you guys should hurry up and just rush him!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hoo-ahhhhhhhhhp!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[You can’t defeat me just by rushing me!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Artpe had slightly slowed down the use of his spell. &nbsp;He was worried about an unexpected situation. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘What if I purify him? &nbsp;What will happen if I change him back into a human?’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Artpe already had experience of reverting a Demon into a human.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had done it with the lovely woman, who was using her fire, next to him. &nbsp;Etna was born with a power that was incompatible with her identity as a Demon. &nbsp;It had been akin to her suffering from a disease. &nbsp;However, she was barely able to find her true self, and she had awakened to her Innate ability.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If that was true….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What if he accidentally purified the Demon King? &nbsp;Would the Demon King’s Innate ability evolve in the worst possible direction? &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Artpe had this thought when he saw the collar around the Demon King’s neck. &nbsp;He never heard of an ability that gave penalty to its user. &nbsp;That meant the Demon King’s Innate ability wasn’t whole. &nbsp;Basically, the Demon King was in a similar situation as Etna.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seemed the Demon King had also realized this fact. &nbsp;He probably found out this defect in his ability when he lost to the previous Demon King. &nbsp;Since there was no way he would submit to the previous Demon King, he had to find a different method. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">According to Artpe’s bank of knowledge, the only method that could accomplish this was the Reclamation magic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, the Demon King was currently weakened since he was resisting against his shackles. &nbsp;However, Artpe wonder if the Demon King was purposefully suffering under Artpe’s magic. &nbsp;What if he was trying to escape the body of a Demon?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘If it is him, it is possible. &nbsp;I have to weigh that possibility. &nbsp;Maybe, he is trying to create something here that’ll allow him to advance to the next stage.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Artpe took a deep breath as he grabbed his magic tome. &nbsp;The wings made by Demonic energy resolved into a black dragon. &nbsp;It was crawling through the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, this was why the Demon King was crafty. &nbsp;He used a flashy spell to look cool, and at the same time, he stealthily used other spells to put pressure on his enemy. &nbsp;Of course, Artpe knew all of this. &nbsp;This was why he couldn’t let the Demon King escape being the target of the Reclamation magic!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Artpe kept cancelling the Demon King’s spell before it could manifest. &nbsp;It was as if the Demon King was only fighting with his body. &nbsp;This was also true with Arpte, since he was challenging the Demon King with his magic. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The never ending black Demonic energy was being invaded and eaten away by the purple Mana. &nbsp;It was like heat and cold fighting against each other. &nbsp;If one could see the the power being used, one would come away impressed. &nbsp;From the perspective of those that were ignorant, it looked as if they were having a staring contest!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Don’t worry about that. &nbsp;When I write my autobiography, I’ll set off couple fireworks in the description for you. &nbsp;In the old tales, I hate the stories where the magicians fight each other. &nbsp;They keep boasting about their great magic as if they are passing a baton back and forth between each other. &nbsp;Those scenes annoy me the most.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Artpe, Etna and Regina played key roles as they fought a fierce magical battle that couldn’t be seen with the naked eye. &nbsp;On the other hand, the other close combat party members rallied around Maetel and Sienna. &nbsp;They left behind their fear for the Demon King, and they bravely attacked the Demon King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Ha! &nbsp;You are hiding something that I don’t know about..]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He keeps saying words I don’t understand! &nbsp;It’s scary!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He isn’t asking you out on a date. &nbsp;Be at ease and just stab him!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The lowest leveled party member was Leseti, but she had grown a lot in the Dungeon prepared by the Demon King. &nbsp;She was able to wound him now. &nbsp;However, the thing that helped her the most was the holy priestess’ Blessing and the Hero’s Flash that was infused at the end of her sword. &nbsp;It would have been impossible to seriously injure the Demon King without it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[It is an ability that is supposed to be granted only to heroes. &nbsp;How is she using it? &nbsp;Interesting. &nbsp;This is getting much more interesting. &nbsp;It almost makes me wish this was the final chapter to this stage. &nbsp;It is regretful that this isn’t the case!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[In the end, you aren’t able to escape your normal pattern!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the regular order of the world, Hero’s Flash was a spell that only heroes could use. &nbsp;However, Artpe and Maetel had bent this rule.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Maetel had evolved her Record Master. &nbsp;In the end, she was able to share the Hero’s Flash with any party members related to Artpe and her!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Am I going to die here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If you do die, you should wish to be reborn in a world where there is no Demon King or Hero. &nbsp;Moreover, it would be great if there were no kings.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Humans….!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Sienna and Maetel created openings, the rest of Artpe’s party members rushed in to injure the Demon King. &nbsp;When the Demon King was about to counter attack, Sienna showed unrivaled bravery by charging the Demon King!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The party was akin to an enormous revolving buzz saw. &nbsp;They were chipping away at the Demon King. &nbsp;In truth, this was possible, because the Demon King wasn’t that talented at close combat. &nbsp;The Demon King realized that he was slowly losing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Etna······! &nbsp;You threw away the peerless body of a Demon for that? &nbsp;You reduced yourself to accomplish what? Did you truly gain what you wanted?!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Artpe, he is starting to put on that really annoying act. &nbsp;I think he’s about to go into the third phase.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ok.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them had toiled under the Demon King for couple hundred years. &nbsp;Whenever the Demon King said something, they already knew what he was going to do!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, the Demon King knew that he had a habit of saying certain phrases. &nbsp;Despite him knowing this, he refused to change his behavior. &nbsp;He continued to be himself even though his pattern of movement was known by his foes. &nbsp;It truly was a behavior befitting a Demon King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[I’ve been going easy on you. &nbsp;However, you won’t have the time to relax from now on.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Maetel, you have to use Accelerate as much as possible! &nbsp;If possible, I want you to share that ability with the others! &nbsp;Get close to him!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Understood!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Demonic energy exploded forth from where the throne had been. &nbsp;It seemed the Demon King had buried a reservoir of Demonic energy beforehand! &nbsp;On top of that, the several traps that hadn’t been activated were triggered all at once. &nbsp;In a flash, the Mana purified by Artpe was turned back into Demonic energy. &nbsp;Artpe could tell this was a technique used by the previous Demon King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[As expected, you are following his orders!?]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[His intent isn’t the same as mine. &nbsp;However, he believed that he had complete control over me, so he gave a portion of his power to me. &nbsp;He made mistake, and I was able to make this place with that power.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Demon King was once again going into a long monologue! &nbsp;This happened only when the Demon King thought his victory was assured!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[There is a limit to how much Mana you can revert in a short amount of time. &nbsp;Well, show me. &nbsp;While you face my spell, will you be able to protect your comrades from the Demonic energy?!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Artpe had to acknowledge it. &nbsp;Up until now, the Demon King had been measuring his magic against Artpe, and he had found the limit to the Reclamation magic. &nbsp;Afterwards, the Demon King upped his power to a higher level, and he bragged about it! &nbsp;He really was like the traditional Demon King from the old stories! &nbsp; He relished in taking on the position of an absolute being!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a flash, the Demon King used his magic, and at the same time, the poisonous Demonic energy assaulted Artpe’s party. It was a desperate situation where someone would die by the attack, but Artpe had a biting smile on his lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His hand went in and out of his Dimensional Pouch. &nbsp;He brought out a long staff!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I knew this would happen. &nbsp;This is why I prepared this, Demite staff Pipi!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Artpe, that sounded really funny!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pipi had been storing Mana up until now. &nbsp;In the next moment, the staff let out a powerful light as it resonated with the magic tome. &nbsp;The Demonic energy and the spells filling the nearby region were all turned into Mana. &nbsp;In a flash, the Demon King was suffocating!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[This is the moment….I’ve been waiting for!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It happened at that moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Demon King’s eyes flashed as he accepted the Mana into his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that moment, he was trying to become the subject of the Reclamation magic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, it was also the moment that Artpe had been waiting for.</span></p>
