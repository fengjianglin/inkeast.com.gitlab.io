 <p dir="ltr"><br></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><br></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Angelo Zard was the emperor of the empire of Zard. &nbsp;The young heroes were full of energy as they descended upon the palace. &nbsp;The emperor sounded stunned as he double-checked with the hero.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So you want us to give you all our Artifacts? &nbsp;Right now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If you don’t want to give it to us, you don’t have to.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Artpe let out a bright smile as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’ll probably take it from us anyways.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then you should just give it all to me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The emperor slowly nodded his head as he spoke. &nbsp;Artpe had been about to carry out his task, but Artpe became surprised at the emperor’s reply. &nbsp;He almost tripped over his own feet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You are just going to give it to me? &nbsp;I’m going to take an extremely high amount of your Artifacts, yet you plan on giving it all to me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It is said that it’s not over until it’s over. However, that is true up to a certain point. &nbsp;You can easily overcome my empire by yourself. &nbsp;What is the point of putting up a fight right now? &nbsp;Moreover, the heroes are needed in defeating the Demon King. &nbsp;I don’t have any grounds for refusing your request.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As expected, they spoke the same language. &nbsp;When Artpe grinned, the emperor got up from his throne as he sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Of course, these are only words. &nbsp;It’ll be hard not to incur the resentment of the nobles. &nbsp;I’ll try to help in carrying out the task, but in the process, you will shoulder most of the blame. &nbsp;I have to blunt their anger and hate in some way. If you feel your ears burning in the future, you only have yourself to blame.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do that. &nbsp;I’m fine with it. &nbsp;Undoubtedly, there will be some that won’t listen to me. &nbsp;At that point, I’ll have to use my power.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In truth, Artpe did something he should have done at an earlier date. &nbsp;The empire had inherited all the magic technology developed by the magic kingdom. &nbsp;The hero’s party used the groundbreaking visual communication system developed by the empire. &nbsp;They sent out a transmission asking for Artifacts and Magic Stones, since they needed it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[This message will be repeated once again. &nbsp;If you give up your Artifacts and Magic Stones without making a fuss, there will be no bloodshed.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hey. &nbsp;I told you that you should speak a bit more softly!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Artpe watched the image floating atop the capital. &nbsp;Maetel had a kind smile on her face, yet she spoke as if she was an overlord. &nbsp;When he saw this, Artpe yelled out in fright. &nbsp;Angelo Zard had &nbsp;a benevolent smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“At the very least, there is no way I will be blamed for this now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Good for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Artpe grumbled in a low voice as he rolled back his sleeves. &nbsp;It was time to carry out his plan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah, Mr. emperor. &nbsp;I need help with one more thing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I hope you aren’t asking me to accompany you to the Demon King’s castle.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Angelo Zard was powerful, but he was powerful according to the human realm’s standard. &nbsp;He could probably fight a 1 on 1 battle with one of the officers under the Four Heavenly King. &nbsp;Moreover, he was an emperor that had founded an empire. &nbsp;He was too valuable to use as a mere soldier. &nbsp;Also…...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I already destroyed the Demon King’s castle. &nbsp;You don’t have to worry about it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How can I not worry? &nbsp;You just said you destroyed the Demon King’s castle. &nbsp;Doesn’t that mean you were able to destroy the Demon King’s castle, yet you weren’t able to defeat the Demon King!? &nbsp;Where the hell is that bastard now!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As expected, the emperor had an interesting reaction to his news. &nbsp;Artpe cackled as he moved onto the main topic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll feel guilty if I only loot the nations. &nbsp;That is why I’m going to loot the merchant companies.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Merchant companies? &nbsp;I don’t think you are talking about the small-to-medium-sized companies….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Anywhere, Might and Seros.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the Dungeon Merchants were affiliated with these three companies. &nbsp;These were mega merchant companies that had bases in each nation. &nbsp;When the emperor heard Artpe’s words, he cackled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh oh. &nbsp;The hero finally lost his mind. &nbsp;You want to steal from the merchant companies? These are the companies that won’t break even if there was a all-out war between the human realm and the Demon realm.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s right.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Artpe was speaking in a spirited manner when he came up with a good idea. &nbsp;He clapped his hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s just falsely accuse them of having improper communications with the Demon realm.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You said it with your lips. &nbsp;It is a false accusation. &nbsp;It is all wrong from the start.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll just frame it like this. If they don’t have any improper relations with the Demon race, they should give up the assets of the company as proof. &nbsp;If a company hides their assets, we can label them as being in league with the Demon race. &nbsp;We can wipe them out…. &nbsp; What do you think? &nbsp;It’s perfect, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was an idea that came from a absolutely mad lad. &nbsp;However, the emperor put on a broad smile when he heard Artpe’s words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I kinda like that idea!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright. I’ll take that as you agreeing to cooperate with me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was an old saying that some people revel in others’ misfortunes. &nbsp;An agreement was made between the emperor and Artpe based upon this concept. &nbsp;His empire’s treasury would be emptied, and it would cause financial difficulties within his empire. &nbsp;However, it wouldn’t be a problem if Artpe looted everyone else’s treasury also! &nbsp;Artpe just had to make everyone equally poor. &nbsp;He had a truly devilish mindset.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon, the emperor of Zard gathered the heads of the mega merchant companies. &nbsp;They were gathered in one place. &nbsp;Since the emperor had requested the meeting, it was impossible to send a subordinate. &nbsp;Everyone sat under the same tent as the emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s start.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I would like to ask you a question before we start. &nbsp;I heard that the hero has gone to each nation, and he has stolen all the Artifacts and Magic Stones…...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The head of the Might company struck first. &nbsp;The head of the Anywhere company and the Seros company frowned slightly. &nbsp;It seemed they had also heard about the calamity that had occurred within each nation. &nbsp;Maybe, the emperor gathered them here to vent his anger. &nbsp;His anger might be directed towards them. &nbsp;He might ask them for something! &nbsp;All three representatives were having the same thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m sorry for your loss, but the merchant companies have already suffered enough losses in this venture. We cannot be more accommodating to your empire.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“At this moment, the storage houses of our companies are being emptied in order to fight against the Demon race.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Everyone should calm down. &nbsp;Emperor Zard just wanted a meeting. &nbsp;There is no way he would made such a rude overture.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The emperor didn’t even have the chance to say anything. &nbsp;The heads of the merchant companies spoke back and forth with each other. &nbsp;They started constructing a line of defense with their words. &nbsp;However, state of affairs always came faster and stronger than one expects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That is why I’m here!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hero!?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Artpe had used Blink, and he had appeared atop the table. &nbsp;The heads of the merchant companies were taken aback. &nbsp;They pushed their chairs backwards. &nbsp;However, there was no way they would be able to run away from Artpe!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ta-da.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Koohk! &nbsp;Barrier!?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It is a high rank barrier of incredible quality!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As soon as Artpe appeared, he flicked his finger to place a barrier over the entire tent. &nbsp;He had use the Materialization spell alongside the Mana Strings. &nbsp;Neither Mana nor any physical substance could exit the barrier!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You were in league with the hero from the start! &nbsp;How can this be!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You were jobbed by the hero, yet you are cooperating with him? &nbsp;You sold us out!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The emperor saw the blood vessels pop out on the necks of the representatives. &nbsp;He spoke in sly manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m still an emperor of an empire, yet you guys are being pretty rude with your words. &nbsp;Above all else, I am on the side of the hero, because I want him to kill the Demon King. &nbsp;I’m not trying to persecute or frighten you. &nbsp;I just want all of us to sacrifice a little bit, so peace can come to this continent..”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Liar! &nbsp;If what you say is true, why are you grinning!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The emperor was having a hard time keeping his expression under control, so Artpe stepped forward. &nbsp;After trying to break through the barrier couple times, the heads of the merchant companies realized that the they were trapped. &nbsp;Artpe sat on the table as he looked at each representative. &nbsp;Every one of them couldn’t face Artpe’s domineering attitude. &nbsp;They looked away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I think you guys already know the full story of what is going on.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Artpe let out an unusually bright smile as he explained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That is why I’ll skip the details. &nbsp;I’ll cut to the chase. &nbsp;In order to defeat the Demon King, I need to create a large scale magic. &nbsp;I need your help in doing this. &nbsp;Basically, I need a lot of Artifacts and Magic Stones.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You emptied an empire, yet you need more?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If you think you can bully us by mentioning the Demon King, you are mistaken. &nbsp;We aren’t naive idiots. &nbsp;Of course, you are the hero, and you are the opposer of the Demon King. &nbsp;However, that doesn’t mean we’ll stand by and do nothing when you point your sword towards us!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The representatives planned on resisting against Artpe as a group! &nbsp;However, Artpe’s attitude remained unchanged. &nbsp;He had a carefree attitude.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m sorry, but I’m not really asking for your help. &nbsp;I just want to explain the current situation I find myself in.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What······?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Moreover, I’ll just carry out what I have to do.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In that moment, Artpe’s smile became twisted. &nbsp;His overwhelmingly dense Mana swept over the entire conference tent. &nbsp;It pressed down on their shoulders. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Koo-huhk!?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Koohk······!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone present were pretty confident in their skills, yet they couldn’t even raise their against Artpe. &nbsp;Artpe was the master of all Mana within the barrier. &nbsp;The only ones that were tranquil were Artpe and the emperor of Zard, who had promised his cooperation from the start.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“When did I give you the impression that you guys had a choice in this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This line should crack the top 5 lines that a hero should never say. &nbsp;It was a vicious statement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t care what you guys think. &nbsp;I just wanted to tell you guys that there is a legitimate reason for doing this. &nbsp;I’m going to take all your Artifacts and Magic Stones. &nbsp;Do you understand me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is ridiculous······!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Even if you are a hero, do you think you can get away with committing a crime!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This bastard isn’t a hero. &nbsp;He is more vicious than the Demon King... &nbsp;Koohk!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The waves of Mana overlapped each other. &nbsp;The representatives had tried to raise their heads, but their heads were shoved back towards the table. &nbsp;They looked very polite in such a pose.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If you turn down my offer, I’ll assume that you are working with the Demon King’s army. &nbsp;In such a scenario, the applicable companies will be broken up and destroyed. &nbsp;That is why you should make a wise decision right now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was more vicious than the Demon King! &nbsp;The representatives of each company realized that Artpe wasn’t speaking in hyperbole. &nbsp;Their eyes widened is dismay. &nbsp;Artpe looked satisfied. &nbsp;He raised one hand as he nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Since I have a good history with Mycenae, I’ll start with the Anywhere company. &nbsp;Everything's better when you get it over with early on even if it is a beating.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“W...what?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Artpe waved his hand, Mana Strings extended from his hand. &nbsp;It bound the head of the Anywhere company.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since they were meeting with the emperor of an empire, the heads of the companies didn’t bring any bodyguards. (Of course, it wouldn’t have made a difference even if they were present.) &nbsp;The head of the Anywhere company couldn’t even put up a fight as he was dragged towards Artpe. &nbsp;Artpe locked eyes with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll be concise with my words. &nbsp;You have a storehouse, right? &nbsp;They hold the truly valuable items that you haven’t released to the continental alliance.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Koohk······!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In truth, the representative of the Anywhere company had somewhat let his guard down. &nbsp;It was as Artpe had said. &nbsp;The Dungeon Merchant Mycenae was affiliated with the Anywhere company, and she had worked with the hero’s party from the beginning. &nbsp;She had a close relationship with them. &nbsp;In fact, Mycenae had facilitated a pretty big deal during the incident in Paladia.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, the Anywhere company was planning on using the heroes for profit after they defeated the Demon King. &nbsp;So how did things turn out like this? &nbsp;The representative felt mixed emotions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I have it. &nbsp;I always carry it with me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I like the fact that you are handing it over without causing me any trouble.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He unfastened the locket that was hanging around his neck. &nbsp;When he opened it, he took out a very small pouch. &nbsp;It wasn’t big enough to fit a single ear of grain. &nbsp;When Artpe saw it, he knew he had hit the jackpot. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Good. &nbsp;Very good.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hero, you really are acting like a real gangster.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Shut up.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a miniature Dimensional Pouch. &nbsp;Despite its size, the compression of the space within the pouch was pushed to the extreme. &nbsp;It boasted a robust interior space where around 500 people could fit within it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Artpe checked the content of the mini Dimensional Pouch, and he nodded his head in satisfaction. &nbsp;There were 16 Artifacts. &nbsp;They were infused with incredible amount of Mana. &nbsp;He also saw Magic Stones harvested from monsters around level 250 and 300. &nbsp;It even had top grade potions. &nbsp;He didn’t need the potions for his spell, but he took it anyways.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What else?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s it. &nbsp;That is all I have. &nbsp;Do you realize how much we’ve expended in the war? &nbsp;We already supplied the rest of the Artifacts and magic stones to the continental alliance. &nbsp;It is all being used in the war efforts.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ok.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the representative saw Artpe back down, he inwardly let out a sigh of relief. &nbsp;Obviously, he had handed over extremely valuable items, but he had carried it around for his own emergency uses. &nbsp;The Anywhere company’s true safehouse was located at the headquarters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had been worried about the next steps he should take, but the hero had backed off without making a fuss. &nbsp;It seemed fate was smiling down on him! &nbsp;These were reasonable assumptions to have in his current situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You are next. &nbsp;What do you want to do?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Koohk······.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, the other representatives had been spectators, and they had been feeling optimistic. &nbsp;Maybe, the hero might stop after taking what the Anywhere company had to offer. &nbsp;Yes, there was no way he would loot all the companies!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, there was something they didn’t know yet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Artpe threatened and blackmailed the representatives, his other party members were executing his plan.</span></p>
