 <p>Chapter 37 - Come to Think of It, I'm a Hero (5)</p>
 <p><span style>In his past life, the hero had grown rapidly despite being severely handicapped by her environment. &nbsp;She had grown from level 200 to level 374 in just a year. &nbsp;Even if a great chef assisted in her devlopment, it would have been impossible to do without her Innate Abilities.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s right. &nbsp;The hero had awakened to an Innate Ability called Acceleration at the age of 19. &nbsp;The Acceleration skill could function as either a passive skill or an active skill. &nbsp;It sped up all her abilities. &nbsp;The smallest benefit from her movement speeding up, and the largest benefit came from it influencing her growth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her level up had been unusually fast until now thanks to a small fragment of her latent innate influencing her. &nbsp;Moreover, the power of Acceleration allowed her to move at unbelievable speed to cut down the black magician.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, if she used it as an active skill, it would consume significant amount of Mana. &nbsp;However, it was the maximization of her basic movements, so it wouldn’t exhaust her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I knew she would awaken to it faster, since she was injected into live battles at an earlier age compared to her previous incarnation. &nbsp;However, I never expected her to learn that particular ability at age 13…...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe looked at Maetel who looked confused. &nbsp;He mumbled to himself as he felt dumbfounded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most in the human race didn’t possess an Innate ability. &nbsp;It was the same for the Demon race. &nbsp;Even if one had the requirements needed to possess an Innate Ability, it was unknown as to when a person might develop that Innate Ability. &nbsp;It wouldn’t surprise anyone if it took several dozens of years for it to develop. &nbsp;It wasn’t impossible for one to fail to develop one’s Innate Ability in one’s life time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, once one’s Innate Ability was awakened, one would gain a power that was on a whole different level. &nbsp;One would also grow at a pace that couldn’t be compared to the previous rate. &nbsp;Most of the beings that left an indelible mark in history all had Innate Abilities. &nbsp;Even when an Innate Ability looks useless, it had a special quality of overpowering other skills and Classes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Innate ability…....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel had heard Artpe’s explanation, but it seemed she was having a hard time wrapping her head around it. &nbsp;It was to be expected. &nbsp;Her actions wasn't something she had done consciously. &nbsp;It had resulted, because she had let her instincts take over her body. </span></p>
 <p><span style>If she was asked to use the Acceleration ability again right now, she would be unable to use it. &nbsp;Of course, the Innate Ability would continue to influence her since it had been awakened. &nbsp;Her level up pace would be faster than before….. &nbsp;Artpe had a thought. &nbsp;Maybe it would really take them less than 2 years to kill the Demon King. &nbsp;He let out a feigned laughter at the thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Maetel, you don’t have to worry too much about it. &nbsp;I’ll slowly walk you through it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I understand, Artpe. &nbsp;As expected, Artpe already has an Innate Ability? ······hue hue. &nbsp;You really are amazing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed she felt a little bit better after deposing the black magician. &nbsp;Maetel was finally able to bring herself to smile a little bit. &nbsp;Aena, who had been watching all of this, impatiently tugged at Artpe’s sleeve.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“M...magician-nim. &nbsp;Can we now...what I’m trying to say is…...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, I’m sorry. &nbsp;This was such an unexpected development that both of us became absent minded. &nbsp;We’ll finish the Quest now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe shook off Aena’s hand, and he turned around. &nbsp;Beyond the dead corpse of the black magician, he could see children writhing in pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It hurts.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mommy·····.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The black magician imprisoning them was dead, yet the children was unable to realize this fact. &nbsp;The children were a hollow shell of themselves. &nbsp;They had lost their normal thoughts and senses. &nbsp;They were being tormented by the pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You will be ok now, kids. &nbsp;We’ll help you guys!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sienna, Sienna!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It hurts. It hurts!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to see my mom. &nbsp;Mommy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The communal space was a mess. &nbsp;How many children were in this place?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The number of monster corpses they discovered coming to the 3rd floor was insignificant compared to the number of children here. &nbsp;If every child here became monsters,.... &nbsp;If the Demon King’s army took control of the monsters here to attack the other towns within this kingdom…..</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The war with the Demon King’s army will be hastened a little bit…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had put a lot of effort in turning the children into monsters, yet they were killed and thrown away inside the Dungeon. &nbsp;The black magician beheaded by Maetel had spouted some nonsense about an experiment. &nbsp;It seemed they weren’t simply trying to turn children into monsters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘No, this isn’t the time to have such thoughts..’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe took out the Obsidian of Greed. &nbsp;At that moment, the flow of energy within the communal space changed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was the faint energy of curse in the air, and the wicked energy leaking out from the corpse. &nbsp;Then there was the curse energy roiling within the innocent children.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of it were changed into black smoke. &nbsp;This black smoke flooded towards Artpe and the obsidian he was holding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Koohk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Artpe!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel had been overwhelmed by the sight created by Artpe. &nbsp;However, she let out a scream when she saw him grip his head. &nbsp;Artpe shook his head as if to tell her that she didn’t need to worry about him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was using the obsidian against numerous children at once. &nbsp;Even if he was the possessor of the Read All Creation ability, he couldn’t escape the headache created by this act….. &nbsp;Still, he’d rather endure the headache rather than see the hero’s heart crumble in this place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You should comfort the children. &nbsp;There is a close connection between the curse and their emotions…… &nbsp;If you speak to them in a calm voice, it should be enough. &nbsp;Please do this for me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“······I understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was hard to tell if they were human or trash if seen from afar. &nbsp;The children were carelessly thrown together in a neglected pile. &nbsp;One could tell that they weren’t given much food or water. &nbsp;It was the perfect environment that would fuel the advance of the curse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sienna! Sienna, where are you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Aena kept calling out her dongsaeng’s name as she walked amongst the children. &nbsp;It seems she wasn’t having any luck finding her. &nbsp;Artpe didn’t have any reason to stop her. &nbsp;He fully understood what she was feeling right now. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You'll be fine, children. &nbsp;You’ll all be fine now.... &nbsp;You’ll be fine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sienna······ Please!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah. &nbsp;Ooh-ahhhhh·····.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was almost like a miracle to them. &nbsp;At that moment, they heard a voice that made the hearts of Maetel, Aena and Artpe brighten. &nbsp;In the midst of the children groaning in pain, they definitely heard a voice that held consciousness!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Artpe!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a quick catch in her voice as Maetel let out a shout of joy. &nbsp;As if he had been waiting for this moment, he started giving her directions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s move him out towards the perimeter! &nbsp;More and more children will be freed from the hold of the curse!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel let out tears of joy as she took the child to the perimeter. &nbsp;It wasn’t just that child. &nbsp;She separated the children in the throes of pain, so each child had some room of their own. &nbsp;She hugged and stroked the children.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her heart had been in a heightened state from the rage she felt. &nbsp;However, her heart had now calmed down. &nbsp;She directed an endless amount of worry and sympathy towards the children. &nbsp;When he saw this, Artpe let out a sigh of relief even though he was suffering from a headache.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, ah-ooh-ooh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I...I can see again. &nbsp;Who are you, noona?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want you to bear with me a little bit further. &nbsp;You’ll make a complete recovery soon!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As more Mana rushed towards the obsidian, more children gained consciousness as they were freed from the curse. &nbsp;It started with one child. &nbsp;The number increased to 10, 50….. &nbsp;&nbsp;The expressions of the other children started to calm down. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Amazing, Artpe…. &nbsp;You are amazing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sienna!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The number of children gaining consciousness went past 100, yet Aena hadn’t caught sight of her dongsaeng. &nbsp;Aena calculated the date when she was captured. &nbsp;Her dongsaeng shouldn’t have been amongst the slain monsters….</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe firmly bit his lips as he checked the status of the black obsidian. &nbsp;The obsidian had darkened to a point where it indicated that it had almost reached its limit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He knew there was a limit to how much it can store, but it had filled up too fast. &nbsp;This quest had been much larger in scale than he had expected it to be.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fortunately, Artpe had prepared for the worst, so he had a contingency plan in his back pocket.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Reinforcement.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the process of smashing through the beginner’s Dungeon with Maetel, he had acquired the Reinforcement skill. &nbsp;This wasn’t just a normal reinforcement skill. &nbsp;The skill allowed him to improve an Artifact at its foundation. &nbsp;In his previous life, Artpe wouldn’t have dare to dream about obtaining such a skill. &nbsp;It was a Rank SSS skill!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This skill was in Artpe’s hands right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He could see the structure of all items through his Read All Creation ability, and now he had the Reinforcement skill. &nbsp;He could use Reinforcement on specific parts of an item, and it was possible for him to reinforce an item that was supposed to be impossible to reinforce. &nbsp;Basically, it was a cheat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as he surmised. &nbsp;It was possible to strengthen the Obsidian of Greed with his Reinforcement skill. &nbsp;In a flash, half of Artpe’s enormous reservoir of Mana was consumed by the obsidian. &nbsp;The obsidian shone brighter than before, and it had increased in size.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once again the flow of energy within the space changed. &nbsp;&nbsp;When the obsidian’s absorption rate was reinforced, the cursed Mana hidden within the body of the children couldn’t resist against the pull of the obsidian. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ggoo-ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It hurts. &nbsp;It hurts too much!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Screams of pain erupted from various locations. &nbsp;However, the pain was proof that they were alive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The scream became shouts, and despair turned into joy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe was controlling too much Mana flow, so it felt as if his head was about to burst. &nbsp;He ignored the pain as he kept increasing the absorption rate. &nbsp;It would be a tragic comedy if monsters were born, because he dawdled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sienna······ Sienna!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“U...unni.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was at that moment when Aena found her dongsaeng. &nbsp;Her dongsaeng was sprawled amongst the children. &nbsp;She had been barely able to regain consciousness thanks to Artpe’s power, and she was able to face her unni.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe glanced towards them when he became loss for words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“U...unni.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sienna? &nbsp;Sienna, what’s wrong! &nbsp;Sienna!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A tragic comedy of a situation was about to really occur right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Unni, it hurts. &nbsp;My head and chest hurts so much. &nbsp;Unni, unni.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“S...Sienna! &nbsp;Magician-nim! &nbsp;My Sienna is….!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe didn’t reply to Aena’s heartfelt plea. &nbsp;He firmly shut his mouth, but he was able to see the most accurate information regarding the girl named Sienna through his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Sienna]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Level : 1]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Strength : 6 &nbsp;Agility : 7 Stamina : 14 Magical Energy : 23]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Transformation Progress to Intermediate Magic-type Species 33%]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Experiment Success]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The curse applied to Sienna had been a success, and she was being turned into a monster. &nbsp;He could try to pull out the curse energy, but the change had already started. &nbsp;The curse and her Mana were tangled, so his actions might make her suffer more pain before she died.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was an absurd situation. &nbsp;How could the timing be like this? &nbsp;Why did it have to be Aena’s dongsaeng? &nbsp;&nbsp;It was a most laughable situation he found himself in. &nbsp;This story seemed to be tailor-made for a hero’s story. &nbsp;It almost made him question if this scenario was constructed from the beginning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Magician-nim! &nbsp;My dongsaeng’s face is darkening…. &nbsp;Magician-nim!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“······.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel was taking care of the other children. &nbsp;Her face stiffened when she realized what Sienna was talking about. &nbsp;However, she wasn't like Aena who kept calling Artpe’s name. &nbsp;She asked Artpe a question with a calm voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Artpe······ Were we too late for this child?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You······.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>What did she plan on doing if they were too late to do anything? &nbsp;Artpe was afraid of her answer, so he didn’t ask the question. &nbsp;She was extremely pure, and she wanted to save the children. &nbsp;In the future, he knew she would regret her decision if things proceeded along this path.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W...warrior-nim. She can recover. &nbsp;It isn’t too late for Sienna! &nbsp;Warrior-nim! &nbsp;Please speak some sense into her, magician-nim!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed Aena could sense what Maetel was planning on doing. &nbsp;Her eyes turned round as she desperately clung to Maetel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was only level 1, so she didn’t have the power to stop Maetel. &nbsp;However, Maetel couldn’t advance as she turned her gaze towards Aena. &nbsp;Matel’s face was also distorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aena…. &nbsp;What if Sienna harms the other children…. &nbsp;What would you do? &nbsp;How would you handle this when the other children will become involved.…. &nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know the answer. &nbsp;I’m sorry, Aena. &nbsp;I don’t know….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can’t, warrior-nim! &nbsp;Please save Sienna! &nbsp;Magician-nim, magician-nim!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed the conversation with Aena had the effect of pushing Maetel towards an unfavorable outcome for Aena. &nbsp;Maetel firmly shut her eyes before she opened them. &nbsp;Sienna was starting to change, so Maetel slowly walked towards her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait a moment, Maetel.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe stopped Maetel at that moment.. &nbsp;The obsidian had reached Rank S thanks to the power of the Reinforcement skill. &nbsp;He had absorbed all the curse from the children except for the one within Sienna.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There wasn’t a single ounce of curse energy within the communal space. &nbsp;It didn’t matter what the Demon King’s army had planned here. &nbsp;A part of their plan ended in failure at that moment. &nbsp;At this point, the Quest could be seen as a success.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, this would be true if they excluded one person, Aena’s dongsaeng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I said stop, Maetel. &nbsp;The Quest hasn’t ended yet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel continued to walk towards the child, but she obediently stopped when she heard him call her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Artpe, perhaps…...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her mouth opened. &nbsp;Her voice shook.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is it possible······?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You should keep your sword unsheathed. &nbsp;We don’t know when she’ll run rampant.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“······yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel unsheathed her sword with trembling hands. &nbsp;Aena no longer held onto Maetel. &nbsp;She just looked at Artpe with pleading eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he received pleading gazes from the two girls, he let out a long sigh as he walked forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At his core, Artpe didn’t like adventures. &nbsp;He was of the opinion that adventurers shouldn’t do adventures.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no reason to take unnecessary risks for him. &nbsp;There was no reason why he should expect failure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He could check all answers with his Read All Creation ability. &nbsp;He just had to act when he had the right answers. &nbsp;It was that simple.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he was looking at Sienna’s information window. &nbsp;She seemed to be in a hopeless situation, but two things bothered Artpe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>First, there was the ambiguous term of ‘Intermediate Magic-type Species’ written in her info. &nbsp;Secondly, he saw the word ‘Experiment Success’. &nbsp;He hadn’t been able to see those words in children that had been successfully turned into monsters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What if the goal of the tests weren’t to make children into monsters? &nbsp;If that was their goal then they would have branded the monster-turned children as successful test subjects. &nbsp;Why would they kill them once they were turned into monsters?</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he kept thinking about it, he kept having questions about the word ‘Intermediate Magic-type Species’. &nbsp;Of course, &nbsp;monsters were a magic type. &nbsp;So why did they use the particular expression of magic type species?</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he discovered the curse for the first time in Aena, he had seen the same phrase. &nbsp;At the time, it hadn’t caught his attention. &nbsp;However, maybe Artpe was operating under a misapprehension?</span></p>
 <p><span style>What if the black magicians and the Demon King’s army weren’t aiming for a simple monster transformation?</span></p>
 <p><span style>What if the fact that the children were completely turned into monsters were considered to be failures? &nbsp;What if they were killed for that reason?</span></p>
 <p><span style>What if there was something special about Aena and Sienna?</span></p>
 <p><span style>What if Sienna was the ‘only’ success in their experiments?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Koo-koo-ahhhhhh. It hurts so much, unni. &nbsp;Unni, unniiiiii!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sienna, no! &nbsp;Sienna!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Artpe······! &nbsp;Hurry!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When it specified magic type species…. &nbsp;It might be referring to the ‘Demon race’.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This test was aimed at making humans into demons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shit. &nbsp;That damn Demon King…...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If this was truly the Demon King’s plan, maybe the Demon King came up with a ‘control’ plan that differed from the one in his previous life!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Maybe he is thinking about using ‘Absolute Control’ on all the beings on this world!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe gritted his teeth as he shouted those words. &nbsp;He couldn’t remain calm any longer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The massive amount of Mana stored within his body was resolved into a Mana Strings. &nbsp;It looked as if wings had sprouted from Artpe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dark Mana threads clung to the entire body of the human girl who was turning into a demon. &nbsp;He started desperately tuning her Mana.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won’t let &nbsp;you do this······!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe’s eyes shone with a purple light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won’t let you have her, you son of a bitch!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was able to see past everything to reach the truth. &nbsp;His Innate Ability always led him towards the right path. &nbsp;He combined the ability with a Unique spell called Mana String.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was supposed to be impossible to combine the two abilities, yet they were combined. &nbsp;The girl’s body was being demonified at an uncontrollable speed. &nbsp;Her body twitched.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Mana within her body started flowing backwards at the guidance of the Mana Strings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The hero forged a miracle at that moment.</span></p>
