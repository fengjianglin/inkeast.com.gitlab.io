 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a bit late to mention this, but the Demon King had reached level 403. &nbsp;Even if the Demon King had lived for a very long time, it was hard to believe that he had reached that level. &nbsp;Moreover, he possessed Demonic energy and skills befitting his high level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Fragment of the Demonic God]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Level : 408]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This monster had appeared out of the summoning circle. &nbsp;Only its arm had escaped, yet it was at level 408</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Its Demonic energy is swelling! &nbsp;Back off!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nyaa-ah. &nbsp;I can’t eat it all!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Was it because it had been summoned through the Demonic King’s Demonic energy? &nbsp;The Demonic energy of the arm possessed similar toxicity to the Demon King. &nbsp;However, it was much more dense and foul. &nbsp;Roa’s Greed ability and the Reclamation magic was getting rid of it whenever they could, yet it was still this bad.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sienna, don’t overextend yourself fighting it! &nbsp;If we buy some time, we will win eventually!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, unni!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fortunately, the Demon King had possessed much more intelligence than the arm. &nbsp;(Although, the arm was as crazy as the the Demon King.) &nbsp;In comparison to the Demon King, the arm was basically a being without consciousness. &nbsp;It was provoked by the two strongest females in the party. &nbsp;It instinctually attacked Sienna and Maetel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The black hand was bumpy and rugged. &nbsp;Each large finger possessed seven additional long demonic fingers. &nbsp;These demonic fingers clawed at the empty air as if it was a mouth. &nbsp;It was as if it was craving for its prey. &nbsp;If one was caught between those fingers, the result would be unimaginable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I understand it now. &nbsp;This is what the Demon King wanted us to experience.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The magic tome with the Reclamation magic was given to Pipi. &nbsp;He regained use of both his hands, and he was able to freely manipulate his Mana. &nbsp;After a thorough examination of the Demonic god’s arm, he came to a conclusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If such a monster descends into this world, it’ll be the end of everything. &nbsp;If we don’t want the world to end, we have to defeat our opposition before they summon the Demonic god. &nbsp;Basically, that is what the Demon King wanted to point out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It would have better if he had just told us that…..”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Etna sounded sad as she mumbled to herself. &nbsp;She lightly swung her arm. &nbsp;A blade of fire arose from the arc drawn by her arm. &nbsp;The fire blade hit the monster’s pinky finger. &nbsp;Instead of cutting off the finger, the attack left behind a very small flesh wound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Koo-ohhhhhhhhhh!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it was enough to make the arm turn towards Etna. &nbsp;It was also what Etna had been aiming for. &nbsp;In the fight against Sienna and Maetel, the arm had been slowly inching closer to the party.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Maetel said we’ll win if we hold out for long enough. &nbsp;However, Artpe….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the arm approached her, Etna sent shot a cannon ball made out of fire towards it. &nbsp;She put all her power into the attack as she asked a question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Will we be able to do it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’ll be possible if the Reclamation magic is maintained until the end. &nbsp;Roa’s Greed ability has no limit. &nbsp;…..the problem lies with Maetel.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Record Master was a cheat ability that gathered the Record of many into one, and she was able to distribute it as she liked. &nbsp;Of course, such an ability would have a time limit. &nbsp;Even if Mana was provided for her use, no one could help her with her mental strength. &nbsp;She had lasted this long through sheer willpower.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hoo-ahhhhhhhhhhp!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Koo-gah-ahhhhhhhk!?]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Artpe and Etna continued to send spells towards the arm as they spoke to each other in a worried tone. At that moment, Sienna brought down her hammer. &nbsp;She had been been given the strength of her entire party, and she was able to crush one finger with her fierce attack. &nbsp;As if she had been waiting for this, Maetel quickly snatched Sienna, and she retreated backwards with Sienna in tow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Afterwards, the enraged Demonic god’s arm grasped the space around it. &nbsp;While Artpe manifested his spells, he had been monitoring the arm’s movement, form and energy. &nbsp;The arm kept repeating the same grasping gesture, and Artpe realized that nothing was left behind in the space grasped by the hand. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everything within the space was gone. &nbsp;Air, dust, Mana and even Demonic energy…..</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“My god······.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Koo-goo-rooooooo-goo-ahhhhhhk!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The power didn’t differentiate between Mana and Demonic energy. &nbsp;It destroyed everything, and Artpe was sure that this was part of the arm’s Innate ability. &nbsp;It was the most simple and destructive Innate ability that Artpe had run across up until now!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even as Artpe saw it with his two eyes, he was having a hard time believing it. &nbsp;How could so much power be given to such a creature! &nbsp; Its finger was crushed by Sienna when its Demonic energy was consumed, but it recovered from the damage. &nbsp;In front of its Innate ability, the regenerative ability of the arm looked like childsplay.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that moment, dust settle atop Artpe’s head. &nbsp;He had been monitoring the ceiling with sharp eyes. &nbsp;At long last, Artpe let out a shout.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The cave is collapsing. &nbsp;Regina!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Understood.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The arm was letting out too much Demonic energy. &nbsp;Even though the Demon King had put his heart and soul into creating this Dungeon, it had reached its limit. &nbsp;Regina used her cold air to temporarily stop the collapse of the cave. &nbsp;Then she directed the large pieces of the ceiling to fall on top of the arm of the Demonic god. &nbsp;She tried to damage it a little bit more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Kee-haaaaaaaah!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A surprising fact was revealed thanks to her actions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The rocks disappeared before they could get near the arm. &nbsp;It didn’t have to make that grasping motion!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It was a feint. &nbsp;Its Innate ability can be activated without the hand making that grasping motion. &nbsp;If it wasn’t for Regina…. &nbsp;Shit. &nbsp;Sienna! &nbsp;Maetel! &nbsp;Don’t approach it until I can suppress its ability!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Artpe busily moved his hands. &nbsp;Several thousand strands of Mana Strings appeared from the tip of his fingers. &nbsp;The Mana Strings kept changing direction as they expanded to fill the cave. &nbsp;The Mana Strings stopped the charge of the arm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Koohk!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The arm had charged forward as if it was going to swallow up the party alongside the cave. &nbsp;However, the arm was stopped for now. &nbsp;Artpe frowned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This son of a bitch is sending its negative energy through my Mana…..!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the arm’s Demonic energy made contact with Artpe’s Mana, a connection was formed. &nbsp;A frightening image appeared within Artpe’s mind, and a curse flowed into his mind. &nbsp;It was intended to mess with Artpe’s mind. &nbsp; It was trying to negate Artpe’s spell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The arm possessed overwhelming Record, so Artpe had guessed that it had possessed more than one Innate ability. &nbsp;He had been right. &nbsp;As expected of a being called the Demonic god, it had splendid abilities!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Koo-goo-roo-rooooooooooo!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ha!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the Mana Strings didn’t melt under the assault of its Innate ability. &nbsp;Artpe also wasn’t lacking in terms of mental strength. &nbsp;At the very least, it wouldn’t work when Artpe’s eyes were letting out the bright purple light. &nbsp;It was truly an amazing attack that contaminated the mind of one’s opponent. &nbsp;Unfortunately, the arm had used it against the wrong opponent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m immune to attacks on my mind, bitch!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Artpe didn’t buckle under its mental attack. &nbsp;He poured more Mana into his Mana Strings! &nbsp; Dozen layers turned into hundreds of layers. &nbsp;The layers of Mana Strings stacked upon each other as it continued to stop the charge of the arm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Etna took Artpe’s hand, a bright fire ran along the strings, and the flame lit up the Demonic god’s arm. &nbsp;She had the blood of an Elemental, so she was weak against mental attacks. &nbsp;However, she was just adding her power to Artpe’s Mana. &nbsp;She could accomplish this without succumbing to the mental attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If we can’t melee it······!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this point, Maetel had correctly assessed the situation. &nbsp;She moved on to her next attack. &nbsp;She held her long sword instead of her bastard sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sword had the ability to compress and shoot out Mana. &nbsp;Maetel preferred the bastard sword, so the long sword rarely got used now. &nbsp;Despite this fact, the long sword had a top tier ability that allowed her to condense her Mana. &nbsp;It was also possible to stop the sword from shooting out the condensed energy. &nbsp;The condensed Mana became fixed to the sword!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Demonic god’s arm was trapped by Artpe’s Mana Strings, so it was barely moving. &nbsp;She aimed for the weakest point on the arm. &nbsp;She used Accelerate as she threw it towards the wrist joint. &nbsp;She put all the power of her Innate ability, and the power granted to her by the Record Master into this deadly throw!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The weapon was invaluable, yet she had basically used it as a one-off throwing weapon. &nbsp;The party was close to being wiped out. &nbsp;It was a desperate situation, so no one stopped her. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Koo-goo-goo-goo-gahhhhhhhh!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The arm of the Demonic god sensed the weapon flying towards it. &nbsp;It tried to destroy the sword, but Artpe’s Mana Strings desperately held back its ability. &nbsp;It resisted against the Mana Strings as it let out a massive amount of Demonic energy. &nbsp;The nearby region was destroyed as Demonic energy filled the cave!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Reclamation magic and Roa’s Greed ability stopped the Demonic energy from reaching the party. &nbsp;However, it couldn’t stop the Demonic energy from changing the course of the sword. &nbsp;When Maetel saw this, she tried to rush forward despite the risk of her mind becoming corrupted. &nbsp;Artpe stepped forward before she could do so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Materialization!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a flash, the long sword grew several dozen times larger. &nbsp;The massive sword extinguished the Demonic energy in its vicinity, and it stabbed into the wrist joint. &nbsp;The hand was severed at the wrist!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We did it!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We aren’t out of the woods yet! &nbsp;G...get rid of the arm!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The severed arm and hand was in shock. &nbsp;However, it started moving again in short order. &nbsp;The handless arm was much larger than the hand, but Artpe didn’t hesitate to attack it first. &nbsp;He determined the Demonic energy of the Demonic god was nested within the arm. &nbsp;The Demonic god’s abilities was concentrated in the hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We can’t get rid of that easily. &nbsp;First, we have to get rid of its arm since it supplies the hand with Demonic energy.!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he spoke, Artpe blocked the hand with his Mana Strings. &nbsp;A more dense Demonic energy assaulted the ground and the ceiling. &nbsp;The ceiling continued to decay as it threatened to fall atop the whole party. &nbsp;Artpe’s Mana String deflected the debris with his Mana Strings!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn’t just that. &nbsp;The giant long sword was still under the influence of the Materialization magic. &nbsp;It slowly floated into the air then it shot towards the hand again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Materialization had a special characteristic. &nbsp;It took a lot of Mana to use it, but it barely used any Mana when trying to change and maintain the spell! &nbsp;The Demonic god’s hand became preoccupied by the enormous sword infused with powerful Mana. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Maetel and Sienna had been waiting for that exact moment. &nbsp;They charged forward. &nbsp;Maetel gripped her bastard sword as she climbed atop the flailing arm. &nbsp;She started degloving the arm with her sword. &nbsp;Sienna ruthlessly pounded on the severed wrist with her hammer. &nbsp;It was as Artpe had said. &nbsp;The Demonic god’s abilities were focused within its hand. &nbsp;The arm was being directly attacked, yet the two girls didn’t suffer from any mental attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hoo, hoo-ooh······.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Maetel, just hold out a little longer!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Little longer? &nbsp;I can do this all day······!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Unni, get out of there! &nbsp;Hoo-ahhhhhhp!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Koo-goo-goo-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone realized that Maetel was lying. &nbsp;She couldn’t keep this up. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite Regina’s intervention, the underground cave was slowly collapsing. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the end, the Demonic god’s hand broke free from Artpe’s Mana strings, and it crumpled the enormous sword. &nbsp;Artpe bit his lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this point, it really looked like the Demon King had planned on killing them with the summoning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘I thought it wouldn’t be worse than the Demon King.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He wanted to punch himself for having such thoughts. &nbsp;The mere existence of a creature with such massive energy and abilities was a calamity in itself. &nbsp;It was a terror, and it possessed the absolute power of the gods. &nbsp;It didn’t need intelligence or consciousness to be a dangerous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Back off! &nbsp;The hand is coming!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Regina, over there!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Denied. &nbsp;It is impossible to use this spell multiple times all at once.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eh-eet······!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The party members were doing their best to resist against the Fragment of the Demonic god. &nbsp;At that moment, Artpe suddenly remembered the Demon King’s last words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘He told me to rise above the gods. &nbsp;He really was laughable until the end.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even a portion of the Demonic god overwhelmed the hero’s party, yet the Demon King expected Artpe to overcome all of it by himself. &nbsp;He knew the Demon King was a psycho, but he had a renewed appreciation of this fact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Artpe grumbled as he raised one hand. &nbsp;Several hundred thousand Mana Strings appeared from his hand. &nbsp;He once again restricted the movement of the hand. &nbsp;Despite the Reclamation magic and Roa’s Greed ability, the hand’s power couldn’t be weakened. &nbsp;It started to suppress and break apart Artpe’s Mana.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Artpe furrowed his brows as he sensed the hand’s innate ability. &nbsp;How could such an Innate ability exist? &nbsp;It was pure destruction. &nbsp;It truly was something….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ssssp. &nbsp;I have no choice.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Artpe cleared his palate as he desperately gathered the Mana that was being suppressed by the hand. &nbsp;Fortunately, there was a portion of the Mana leftover after it suffered under the Demonic god’s Innate ability. &nbsp;It really showcased how much control Artpe had over his Mana. &nbsp;He had reached the peak In terms of controlling Mana.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Record of Destruction…. &nbsp; Please work.”</span></p>
