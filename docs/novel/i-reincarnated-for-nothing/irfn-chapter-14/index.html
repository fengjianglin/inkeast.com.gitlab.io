 <p>Chapter 14 - The Link Between You and I (2)</p>
 <p><span style>A modicum amount of time had passed from that moment. &nbsp;It was a short amount of time where not even one hour had passed. It was also the moment in their lives where Artpe and Maetel had to focus the most.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe was in a precarious situation where his Mana was about to bottom out, so he continued to keep a low profile. &nbsp;In the end, Maetel’s Swordsmanship had reached level 9…..</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Skeletons, who were exhausted from battle, tried a new tactic where they purposefully tried to die through Maetel’s attacks. &nbsp;However, Artpe intercepted them by throwing his shield into their abdomen. &nbsp;They were put out of the battle by the hard hits, and the only thing these Skeletons could do was roll around the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, Artpe felt himself reach his limit in terms of his body and Mana.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hoo-ooh. &nbsp;Koo-hoo-ooh….!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is all done, Artpe!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ggoo-oohk. &nbsp;All right.!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe was moments away from losing his consciousness. &nbsp;He was about to fall to the floor. &nbsp;However, a voice of an angel could be heard through Artpe’s ears. &nbsp;Artpe gritted his teeth as he fought to stay up. &nbsp;He checked the state of the Dungeon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as if hell had manifested on this floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Goo-gahk, gah-gah-gahk…...]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[There is no way…. &nbsp;&nbsp;I’ll accept…..]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Death… &nbsp;I only want an honorable death…..]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The number of Skeletons, who had died, was zero. &nbsp;The number of Skeletons capable of continuing the battle was also zero. &nbsp;The floor was a mess. &nbsp;It was hard to tell if the bones were ribs or spines. &nbsp;They were all just rolling around the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two heroes had taken down over 400 Skeletons, and it drove home the absurdity of the situation faced by the party of two.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you ok, Artpe….?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m still alive but, you…. &nbsp;&nbsp;Are you able to cancel your Berserk state?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“·…...yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as she said. &nbsp;Her emotions started to calm after speaking those words. &nbsp;The red haze that had covered her entire body dissipated, and her Mana calmed. &nbsp;Artpe let out a bitter laugh at the sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rage had swept over her, and her rage had paralyzed a portion of her rationality. &nbsp;He had been a little bit worried that she wouldn’t have been able to cancel her Berserk state. &nbsp;It might have led to an accident occurring…. </span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed his fears had been baseless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, a wrong was a wrong even if the two of them survived the battle unharmed. &nbsp;First, he ended the Mana link with her. &nbsp;He narrowed his eyes as he spoke in a stern voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Were you aware that you had learned a dangerous skill?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. &nbsp;However, if I hadn’t maintained it, I thought Artpe would die….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Still, if you had died, all of this would have been for naught. &nbsp;If I survived while you died in this place, do you think I would have been happy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah-oooh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she heard Artpe’s cold voice, Maetel’s cheeks turned red, and she lowered her head. &nbsp;When he saw this sight, he finally took his ire down a peg.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was easy to forget, but she was a beginner hero. &nbsp;She had picked up the sword less than a week ago. &nbsp;She was only a 12 year old girl. &nbsp;Yet she had somehow kept a hold on her rationality as she maintained her Berserk skill. &nbsp;In truth, she deserved praise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The danger of using that skill is so high, because it is a skill that deals with an emotion. &nbsp;If you think of the skill as your absolute ally, it’ll come back as a blade that will plunge itself into your heart. &nbsp;I just want you to remember this fact. &nbsp;&nbsp;All right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Y...yes. &nbsp;I’ll keep that in mind.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“....all right. &nbsp;Let’s finish this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In truth, he wanted to sit her down and give her a lecture. &nbsp;However, he worried his words would create an artificial ceiling for her talent, so he decided to leave it be.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hoohp.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He violently pulled on the threads connected to the shield. &nbsp;The enormous shield fell from the air to destroy the skulls of the nearest Skeletons. &nbsp;All the Skeletons on the floor had already been inflicted with several layers of the shield’s curse, so they couldn’t put up any fight against the shield. &nbsp;&nbsp;They were broken into pieces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[D...dead.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Our comrades were completely annihilated…..]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Our power is getting stronger, but….]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“May I destroy all of them, Artpe?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, you can destroy all of them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe let out a kind laugh as he raised his hand again. &nbsp;The shield floated into the air as it followed his hand gesture. &nbsp;It stood on its edge, and it started to rotate in a violent manner. &nbsp;Maetel also squeezed out the remaining energy left in her tired body as she swung her bastard sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Koo-ahk!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Koo-gah-gahk!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Regret……..]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every time one Skeleton was killed the other Skeletons felt a surge of energy within their bodies. &nbsp;However, the only thing they could do with the abundance of energy was to rattle around the floor. &nbsp;Of course, as more Skeletons died, the defense of the remaining Skeletons also increased. &nbsp;The Skeletons couldn’t even jump towards the two heroes to attack them, so the improvements being wrought on the Skeletons were meaningless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A single blow isn't enough to kill them. &nbsp;Eh-eet! &nbsp;Eh-eet!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is a better way to do this, Maetel. &nbsp;You shouldn’t unnecessarily harm you weapon’s durability.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe extended his Mana Threads, and he took control of the Skeletons, who couldn’t put up much of a fight. &nbsp;He started bashing the skulls of Skeletons against each other. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was able to smash and eliminate the Skeletons in an effective manner!</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Koo-ahhhhh!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You… &nbsp;You wicked bastards…..!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>He used the hardened skulls against each other! &nbsp;Although his past occupation was being one of the Four Heavenly Kings, he was displaying a level of ruthlessness that might exceed the Demon King!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Artpe is amazing! &nbsp;This really is easier than breaking them with my sword!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, it really is….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The current hero was already different person now. &nbsp;In her previous incarnation, Maetel had been a pure and innocent woman. &nbsp;He had seen her shed tears when one of the Four Heavenly King had died. &nbsp;She had been a virtuous woman. &nbsp;Now she was a girl, who was smashing Skeletons against each other!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe realized how important early education was as he swung the skull. &nbsp;If someone saw the two, they wouldn’t think they were heroes. &nbsp;They looked like great candidates to become the next Demon King.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, the moment of truth arrived.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“These are the last ones, Artpe.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Look at how hard their skulls are. &nbsp;It is hard to call them as being Skeletons anymore. &nbsp;They are almost on the same rank as a Dullahan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[We want you to give us an honorable death….!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The power of several hundred Skeletons were split between the two remaining Skeletons. &nbsp;The two skulls were the product of this process. &nbsp;They were so heavy and hard that one wondered if they could be used as weapons. &nbsp;Artpe was weak in strength, so he couldn’t even lift the skulls. &nbsp;Maetel, who easily swung the bastard sword, was barely able to lift them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As an experiment, she threw the skulls against the wall. &nbsp;The blameless wall cracked instead of the skulls. &nbsp;Artpe tilted his head in puzzlement when he saw this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think it is comparable to a level 100…..?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So is it better to catch 400 level 50 Skeletons or one level 100 Skeleton? &nbsp;Which gives better EXP?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, the former gives an overwhelmingly more EXP. &nbsp;Anyways, this magic wasn’t meant to give its opponents EXP in such a manner.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In terms of EXP, Artpe and Maetel was suffering a very huge loss through this venture.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If they had killed 400 normal level 50 Skeletons, they would have been strengthened by a ridiculous amount. &nbsp;However, if one looked at the outcome of this battle, it had been equivalent to killing a level 10 Skeleton.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However, the world isn’t only about EXP.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When one defeated an enemy that was significantly higher in level, one’s Achievement was recorded. &nbsp;It was something that followed one throughout one’s lifetime.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If one defeated a level 70 enemy at level 50, the Achievement remained throughout one’s lifetime. &nbsp;It had the effect of aiding the one, who had acquired the Achievement. &nbsp;&nbsp;Even if one faced an enemy of higher level at a later date, the effects of the Achievement won’t weaken or disappear. &nbsp;It helped one fight the higher level enemy head-on. &nbsp;It even had an influence on the acquisition of skills, and the reward items that one acquired from battling monsters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“On top of it all, you can’t ignore the skill growth that occurs when you apply the finishing blow. &nbsp;Normally, a skill grows the more you use it. &nbsp;The other method to grow your skill is to kill an enemy using the skill. &nbsp;If you acquired the skill while fighting an enemy, the successful killing of the enemy allows the skill to grow once more.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow. &nbsp;Amazing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, there was no adjustment if one wasn’t successful in killing the enemy. &nbsp;This was also true for running away or canceling the battle. &nbsp;The reason why this happened was unknown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Someday, he’ll ask the question to the god, who had made this world. &nbsp;He’ll seize the bastard by the collar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The technical term for this phenomena is called Rumination.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Artpe knows everything!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know everything. &nbsp;I know what I know.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Maetel was asking questions and receiving answers from Artpe, she was bashing the two skulls against each other. &nbsp;Cracks were forming on the skulls. &nbsp;Her repetitive action was so mechanical that he felt goose bumps all over his body. &nbsp;Artpe took a small step backwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[I won’t forgive you. &nbsp;I will revive someday, and I will raise my sword in revenge against you guys!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. &nbsp;Next Undead, please.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hoo-ooh….. This is the last one!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel let out a shout as she brought one skull against the other. &nbsp;At that moment, she gathered the small amount of Mana left inside her body into her arms. &nbsp;This single strike was more powerful than any of her previous blows. &nbsp;It cleanly pulverized both skulls. &nbsp;At the same time, it wouldn’t have surprised Artpe if she gained the Bash skill through this action.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Anyways, this was how all the monsters on the 6th floor were eradicated. &nbsp;&nbsp;The Mana and the Record had been gathered into a single bundle. &nbsp;It was finally released from the monsters, and it was given to the challengers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah-ooh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel let out a short moan. Artpe had somewhat expected this so he kept his mouth shut, but it wasn’t as if he was fine. &nbsp;It felt as if all their internal organs had been dislodged. &nbsp;They felt nausea sweep over them as if their internal organs were spinning around like a tornado.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Artpe…. &nbsp;This is....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Endure it…. &nbsp;It is the level up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is it? Koo-oo-oohk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Maetel]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Level : 34]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Level : 35]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Level : 36]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Level : 37]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe could see Maetel’s information update in real time. &nbsp;His innate ability wasn’t broken. &nbsp;Artpe was probably going through a similar situation as her right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two Skeletons had been strengthened to the extreme, and their EXP was divided between two, who were in their early level 30s. &nbsp;Of course, their levels would increase in a flash. &nbsp;A level up strengthened the body and soul. &nbsp;They were going through about a dozen level ups, so it wasn’t strange to see their bodies undergo an abrupt change.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It hurts so much, Artpe.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Endure it. &nbsp;It’ll pass soon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes….!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Maetel]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Level : 41]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel’s ability shone in this instance. &nbsp;Even if she received the same amount of EXP as others, she grew at a much faster pace. &nbsp;Artpe’s pain was slowly ebbing away, but it seemed Maetel was still in distress.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Artpe experienced his rapid level ups, he felt his Mana fill up in an instant. &nbsp;He took deep breaths as he monitored Maetel. &nbsp;Shortly, Maetel also let out a deep sigh as if she was expelling everything that had built up inside her. &nbsp;Then she sat down heavily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Level ups are really miraculous… &nbsp;I’m incredibly tired, yet I feel really strong..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your existence seems to be most miraculous phenomena to me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Maetel]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Level : 43]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Swordsmanship Lv11]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Mana Control Lv8]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Berserk Lv7]</span></p>
 <p><span style>How could this information be about a girl, who picked up the sword only a week ago? &nbsp;Even a mercenary, who participated in battles for 10 years, would be unable to grow to this extent!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe still didn’t like the purpose behind this Dungeon, yet he had to grudgingly admit that it had been very helpful in radically maturing the hero. &nbsp;She had grown in skill by facing an amalgamation of monsters that resided on a single floor. &nbsp;What Achievement will she be able to gain if she faced a monster, who possessed the combined might of all the floors!</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Of course, it’s a death sentence to carry out the original test.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He still couldn’t believe he was able to cause change to the Record Link. &nbsp;It really was a result that had risen out of his desperation. &nbsp;Artpe shook his head as he let out a bitter laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The wall is opening, Artpe.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is set-up to do so.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had gained control of the 6th floor of the Dungeon, so the Record Link placed on this floor was cancelled. &nbsp;When they descended to the 7th floor, they arrived at a small fountain. &nbsp;It was placed there as if to encourage the weary to rest at this spot. &nbsp;Artpe looked at Maetel, who let out a cheer. &nbsp;He smiled as he nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t be fooled. &nbsp;It is poisoned water.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This Dungeon is really terrible!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ll be fine if you keep that attitude. &nbsp;There is nothing here you should trust in this damned place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before Artpe could finish his words, a faint light started to emanate near the fountain. &nbsp;Artpe’s eyes twinkled when he discovered it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m sorry. &nbsp;Let me modify that statement. &nbsp;There is one person you can trust here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The light disappeared, and in its place, a beautiful woman with a big cart appeared. &nbsp;Maetel tilted her head in confusion when she saw this stranger suddenly appear in front of them. &nbsp;Artpe grinned. &nbsp;He turned to look at Maetel as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m talking about the Dungeon Merchant.”</span></p>
