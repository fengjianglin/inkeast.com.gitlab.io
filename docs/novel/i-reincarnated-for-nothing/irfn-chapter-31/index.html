 <p>Chapter 31 - Dungeon, Evolution and Success (5)</p>
 <p><span style>[Silpennon (Le Diaz)]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Thief]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Level : 49]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Silpennon purchased the Crystal Ball of Blessing for 300 gold, and he was able to safely choose his new class. &nbsp;There was no funny business like a third hero making an appearance. &nbsp;It was the same as what Artpe had seen in his past life. &nbsp;The path to being a thief was opened to Silpennon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Crystal Ball of Blessing was a very expensive and rare artifact. &nbsp;After registering its owner, it could be used several more times. &nbsp;Silpennon could use it to open the path to his high rank Class in the future.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ho-ooh. &nbsp;I’m a thief.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Koohk. &nbsp;He really is a thief…...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Inwardly, Artpe had worried another change would occur, but he could relax now. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the crown prince she had served was turned into a thief, Leseti became forlorn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Maybe I should give up on everything. &nbsp;Maybe I should go live in the countryside, and feed cows…...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you think running a dairy farm is easy? &nbsp;The Demon King may overlook such arrogance, but I won’t overlook it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you think running a dairy farm involves! &nbsp;What type of fantasy are you caught up in!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Silpennon was the only one in a peaceful state amongst all of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is wrong with being a thief? &nbsp;I don’t feel too bad about it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Crown prince was a position that allowed him to possess absolute authority, but at the same time, it was a shackle that he couldn’t escape from. &nbsp;When his father the king was killed, he had run away from his uncle’s evil influence, and he had reached this point. &nbsp;&nbsp;Silpennon kind of liked the view of the world from where he stood right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not in a position where I’m completely happy with the situation, but….. &nbsp;Yes, I’m Silpennon the thief now. &nbsp;Hoo. &nbsp;It isn’t too bad. &nbsp;Moreover, I had always yearned to get out of my birdcage. &nbsp;It feels as if I’ve grabbed freedom by the hand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Silpennon kept smiling as he observed good manners towards Artpe again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If it wasn’t for you, I don’t know what would have happened to me. &nbsp;The fact that I followed after you might be the best decision I’ve made in my life. &nbsp;Thank you, Artpe.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The hard part will start from now on. &nbsp;If you thank me so early, I’ll feel guilty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You really are the type of person that can’t accept a thanks without making a fuss..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All Four Heavenly Kings of the Demon King’s army were like that. &nbsp;If they were transparent about their feelings, they would meet their end before they could even start. &nbsp;Ah, this also made it hard for them to return the feelings of others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh? Silpennon, Silpennon……”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Mycenae suddenly tilted her head in puzzlement as she looked at them. &nbsp;The name made her think of a hot issue right now. &nbsp;It happened when she was having this thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Silpennon didn’t hesitate. &nbsp;He nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right. &nbsp;I used to be the crown prince of Diaz.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your highness, you shouldn’t tell her that!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Did he decide it was information that he didn’t need to hide? &nbsp;Or was he just too young? &nbsp;Of course, a Dungeon Merchant didn’t go around blabbing about information regarding a customer. &nbsp;Still, it wasn’t wise to reveal such information unnecessarily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Silpennon was already well aware of this fact. &nbsp;He wasn’t an idiot. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However, I’m not anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Silpennon looked back with a refreshed expression on his face. &nbsp;He wanted to accept his current self, so he planned on making a clean break from his past.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So stop call me by that title, Leseti. &nbsp;I’m only a level 49 thief Silpennon now. &nbsp;I plan on burying my position as the crown prince in the darkness until we defeat the Demon King. &nbsp;That is why I don't care, who finds out about it. &nbsp;No one will be able to find the crown prince Silpennon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mycenae’s eyes became round.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh my. &nbsp;So that’s how it is. &nbsp;Somehow, I did feel an air of nobility coming from you. &nbsp;Wait a second. &nbsp;Did my little customers already have a connection to the throne…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As her imaginations started to stretch far and wide, Artpe extended his finger to wrap the end of the Mana String into a ball. &nbsp;He tapped it against Mycenae's smooth forehead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah-yaht!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you act so clingy, you won’t be popular with men, ajumma.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kooh…. &nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever &nbsp;you may take me for, before I became a merchant, men lined up just to be able to catch my eyes! &nbsp;There were enough of them to encircle the central square ten times! &nbsp;Customer, you are the only one that doesn’t recognize my charm! &nbsp;This is the problem with kids!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe completely ignored Mycenae's grumblings as he gathered all the loot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was hard to express this in words. &nbsp;It was merely a Slime Dungeon, yet the items and rewards gathered there was too amazing. &nbsp;Of course, a part of the reason was the fact that they were the first to discover this Dungeon. &nbsp;Moreover, all the secret locations had been revealed. &nbsp;On top of that, the artifacts were all gathered in a single place by the Huge Slime. &nbsp;It all came out from its body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The items that possessed weak magical energy were dissolved into pure magical energy within the Huge Slime. &nbsp;The magical energy either strengthened the Huge Slime or it strengthened the other items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, the remaining items would go up in value.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s a lot this time around. &nbsp;Did you completely clean out the whole Dungeon?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. &nbsp;It is as you say. &nbsp;Let’s see…… &nbsp;I want 653 gold for all the minor items. Call?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm… &nbsp;Call.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both sides already knew that the other was a master. &nbsp;This was why the transaction between Artpe and Mycenae didn’t take long.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, the worth of the items was assessed and the transaction ended. &nbsp;It happened way too fast. &nbsp;The rest of the party looked on in disbelief. &nbsp;They looked at Artpe and Mycanae as if they were some kind of monsters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe handed over all the loot to Mycenae, but he held back several artifacts. &nbsp;It was time for them to earnestly evaluate the worth of the artifacts. &nbsp;Mycenae gulped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In truth, the items I really want you to sell me are those…...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let me think about it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In truth, Artpe had wished for more Skill Books to come out, but it ended at the Mana Control. &nbsp;Even the common Fire Magic Spell Book hadn’t dropped. &nbsp;Instead, there were rare items that were as rare as the Huge Slime.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s talk about this potion first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Slime Potion]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[All forms of liquid will be made into slime. &nbsp;If someone with low resistance to Mana drinks it, one will die immediately as one’s blood would be turned into slime. &nbsp;It is a very rare and foul substance. &nbsp;It doesn’t emit hostile Mana, so it is perfect to use for assassination. &nbsp;Only a Slime that has evolved to the extreme may produce it at a low probability. &nbsp;This item has almost never been seen before within history.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“······mmmm?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is that potion, customer? &nbsp;What is it? &nbsp;It is bothering me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This…. &nbsp;I’ll keep it for now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had no idea where he should use this. &nbsp;However, strange and useless items like this usually helped out at crucial moments.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aht. &nbsp;You should give me an explanation on what it is…. &nbsp;&nbsp;Ooh-eeeee”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mycenae's cheeks puffed out when Artpe put away the potion without giving an explanation. &nbsp;Of course, he wasn’t into older women, so he ignored the rest of her words. &nbsp;He took out the second loot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It looked as if it was an item that was crafted by using a part of the Huge Slime’s body. &nbsp;It was a longbow that didn’t look too sturdy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Flexible Hunter’s Bow]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The shape will change depending on the user’s objective. &nbsp;It can change from a short bow to a ballista. &nbsp;Mana will be consumed to make a Mana Arrow. &nbsp;Its power will depend on the user’s Archery level. &nbsp;Users without Archery level of 100 cannot use it. &nbsp;It is possible to increase durability of the item by injecting Mana.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he checked the information regarding the Artifact, Artpe couldn’t hold back his words. &nbsp;He tackled the issue that was bothering him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ballista should not be classified as a bow!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pull yourself together, customer! &nbsp;That isn’t a ballista. &nbsp;It is a longbow!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe activated his Read All Creation ability again, and he checked each component of the bow. &nbsp;He injected some of his power to check if the bow could change into a short bow and a ballista.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, the requirement to use the bow was to be an archer of high rank Class, but Artpe was a hero. &nbsp;He could easily brush aside such restrictions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huhk. &nbsp;It really is a ballista!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is better than expected…....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe ignored the shocked Mycenae. &nbsp;He calmly retreated. &nbsp;He turned around to look at Maetel, and he asked her a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you have any thoughts about using a bow, Maetel?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It looks fun to use, but I’m not confident that I can handle anything that isn’t a club or a sword. &nbsp;That is why I don’t want it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You made a good decision.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was talented enough to pick up any weapon, and she would be able to use it well enough to be comparable to the people of the same Class. &nbsp;However, if she learned too many things, she might regret it someday. &nbsp;She was most suited to close combat. &nbsp;She should focus on what she was best at.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Customer, I will…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want 1,650 gold. &nbsp;Do you want to buy it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ooh-mmmmm. &nbsp;&nbsp;If I can find the proper owner, I’m confident I can charge twice that price, but…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You do know there is a scarce supply of this type of artifacts in the world, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe had a fair point. &nbsp;It was a bow that could change form to fit the situation!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It can be used from short range to very long distance. &nbsp;Moreover, there was no need to carry around arrows, and the durability could be recovered. &nbsp;If Artpe was an archer, he would have kept it. &nbsp;It would have been a no brainer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A right owner…. &nbsp;A right owner….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mycenae thought over it for a very long time. &nbsp;This was a huge transaction, so she would have to invest a lot into this venture. &nbsp;This was why she was a bit hesitant. &nbsp;Artpe coaxed her to allay her concerns.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have to buy a lot from you this time around.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“······hoo-ooh. &nbsp;I’ll buy it for 1650 gold.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was how over 1,500 gold was exchanged in a single transaction. &nbsp;Silpennon was a crown prince of a nation, yet even his mouth fell open at the sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are adventurers the type of occupation where one makes a lucrative amount of money?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, if all adventurers could find a jackpot of a Dungeon like these little customers, they could earn as much. &nbsp;Unfortunately, 70% of all adventurers fail to find anything. &nbsp;Then about 20% of the adventurers covet the treasures, but they retreat when faced with danger. &nbsp;Nine percent of the adventurers bravely charge forward and they are killed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So that means only 1% of them are able to get what they want?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Moreover, if the 1% challenges another Dungeon, they’ll be back in the roulette with 1% chance of succeeding.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Opportunity always come hand in hand with risk. &nbsp;However, one shouldn’t be delusional about the order in which it was faced. &nbsp;If opportunity exists within danger, the idiots always died first.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“... I will take those words to heart.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, if one observe these customers, it does make one wonder if those statistics are wrong!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Mycenae delivered the warning with a serious voice, she undercut her own words as she turned around. &nbsp;She looked at the last loot left behind by the Huge Slime..</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The last thing left is the chest plate. &nbsp;Its durability and Mana reaction seems to be uncommon…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, before the sensor for Mycenae's worldly desires could activate, Artpe handed the armor to Maetel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Maetel.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, thank you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why don’t you two just hurry up and marry?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was called a Blast Plate. &nbsp;It was an armor that only protected the body from the front.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had a red sheen, and at a glance, one could tell it was something extraordinary. &nbsp;It had the option of protecting its owner from a critical blow, and a fixed amount of Mana was consumed to blunt the effects of an attack. &nbsp;The options were perfect for a defensive gear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The cherry on top was that it had a similar option to the Bone Gauntlet. &nbsp;It could raise the user’s strength by detecting its owner’s emotions. &nbsp;It was the perfect armor for Maetel, who used Berserk. &nbsp;Since it had an emotion type buff on it, it was the emotion felt by the Huge Slime right before it perished. &nbsp;However, such information could be omitted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hue hue. &nbsp;The red light is too pretty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah. &nbsp;I think there are more customers that will look for that instead of the bow…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel was happy, and Mycenae was wistful. &nbsp;Leseti, who didn’t have any claims to the artifact, could only look on as she smacked her lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as if he didn’t care what they were feeling. &nbsp;Artpe suddenly sat on the floor, and his eyes let out a harsh light. &nbsp;It was as if the main fight was yet to come! &nbsp;That was what his expression indicated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sit next to me, Maetel.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel, who didn’t know what was going on, sat next to Artpe, and her eyes shone too. &nbsp;The bizarreness of the situation doubled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe spoke in a solemn manner towards the puzzled Mycenae.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I told you I have a lot to buy this time around, ajumma.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not an ajumma. &nbsp;However, you clearly did say that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hoo…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe shut his eyes tight. &nbsp;There were a lot of thoughts going through his head as he was about to spend an enormous amount of money.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Should he do it right now? &nbsp;Should he? &nbsp;He needed money for many things in the future, so should he make such an expenditure at this point in time?</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he didn’t know when he’ll be able to see the Dungeon Merchant again. &nbsp;It would be hard to find a suitable location such as this…..</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll be embarrassing if you suddenly confess to me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe replied to Mycenae's remark, which had been made in humor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want you to give me all the Skill Books that can be learned by a level 150 Warrior and a level 150 Magician.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“······.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe did the only thing that the palace did right in developing the hero. &nbsp;Basically, he started on the task of turning money into ability. </span></p>
