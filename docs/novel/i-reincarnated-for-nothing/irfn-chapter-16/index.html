 <p>Chapter 16 - The Link Between You and I (4)</p>
 <p><span style>Mycenae tried her best to look pitiful as her eyes watered. &nbsp;She gave a request to Artpe. &nbsp;In truth, her main objective hadn’t been the </span><span style>Basilisk Venom Powder. &nbsp;She was here for the treasure box.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W...will you sell the content of this box to me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll make the decision after seeing what’s in it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe gave a cold reply. &nbsp;Moreover, his gaze was cold too. &nbsp;He was silently pressuring her. &nbsp;It was as if he was trying to tell her to quickly move her heavy body to the side! &nbsp;Mycenae’s stunning beauty was on the same level as a pebble rolling around in the streets. &nbsp;It held no meaning to him!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kook….. &nbsp;This is the first time I’ve suffered such humiliations since I started working for the Anywhere company…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow! &nbsp;It’s a treasure chest!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>An old pair of wood framed glasses and a pair of black leather boots appeared from within the treasure box. &nbsp;Mycenae's eyes once again shone with a fierce light!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you going to sell it to me!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll sell you only one of the two.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he spoke those words, Artpe pushed the wood framed glasses towards her. &nbsp;Mycenae was able to confirm a suspicion she had.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You must possess a tremendous observation magic.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn’t I tell you not to pry? &nbsp;Well, it is obvious at this point in time, but…. &nbsp;&nbsp;Well, since I’ve been pretty heavy handed up until now, I’ll sell it to you at a price where I won’t see much profit. &nbsp;I want 45 gold.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F….forty f…...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll buy it. &nbsp;Thank you very much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The magnitude of money being exchanged had suddenly changed, and Maetel was taken aback. &nbsp;However, Mycenae willingly paid the price! &nbsp;Maetel’s eyes were spinning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe had a grin on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As expected, Dungeons are honey pots. &nbsp;We just have to avoid being trapped and killed by the honey.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Customer. &nbsp;At the Anywhere company, we offer services ranging from providing support to escorting parties. &nbsp;If you need such services….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“By doing so, you plan on taking half my loot as recompense? &nbsp;Dream on. &nbsp;Just give me my money.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The wood framed glasses allowed one to probe the surroundings when the magic infused within the lenses was consumed. &nbsp;As the holder of the Read All Creation ability, Artpe had no need of this item. &nbsp;However, it was something all adventurers wanted when entering a Dungeon! &nbsp;Since the demand was high, the price was also high.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The most unfortunate aspect of this item was the fact that it could only be used a limited number of times. &nbsp;It disappeared after several uses. &nbsp;This was why consumable items were priced depending on their number of uses, and this was one of the reasons why this particular item was given a high price.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mycenae had estimated the amount of Mana within the wood framed glasses, and she knew she could easily sell it for 50 to 60 golds at the minimum. &nbsp;She had a satisfied expression on her face as she put away the item into her cart. &nbsp;Her eyes were sparkling once again. &nbsp;Then her gaze landed on the black leather boots. &nbsp;They were letting out a sheen of a high grade item.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Customer. &nbsp;I really want to purchase the boots…....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not selling you this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe answered flatly. &nbsp;He took off his worn-out shoes, and he put on the leather boots. &nbsp;Maetel clapped her hands. &nbsp;She said it looked good on him, but Artpe didn’t care if it looked good or not. &nbsp;The only thing important to him was its performance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I never expected to find a pair of Blink Boots in this Dungeon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had known it was a rare item, but she never expected it to be the Blink Boots! &nbsp;Mycenae grinded her teeth. &nbsp;Maetel didn’t know much about magic, so she innocently tilted her head in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blink was a magic that allowed one to instantly travel a short distance. &nbsp;Magicians used this magic to get out of danger. &nbsp;Since it was a magic spell, it had the downside of needing a long cast time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it was a completely different story if the magic spell was contained within an artifact. &nbsp;It only needed an infusion of Mana or a fulfillment of a specific condition to activate. &nbsp;This was why the effectiveness of this magic increased in a single stroke!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is why boots containing Blink Magic are worth 100 gold at the very least! &nbsp;It doesn’t matter if &nbsp;the Mana efficiency of the item is low!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Amazing, Artpe!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ooh-ahhhhhhhh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>On top of it all, this pair of boots had an option of activating on its own during a moment of crisis. &nbsp;It could be used once a day without it consuming Mana . &nbsp;It was also possible to use it again by adding in more Mana. &nbsp;Amongst the boots with the Blink option, it wasn’t an exaggeration to say that these ones were ranked in the highest class.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As a cherry on top, it had a low level requirement, so Artpe could equip it. &nbsp;For Artpe, good things came in threes. &nbsp;If he was to estimate the price of this pair of boots…. &nbsp;&nbsp;It would be too annoying to come up with an estimate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Artpe will be safe now. &nbsp;I’m so happy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is up with this customer….?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you think? &nbsp;She’s so innocent that she would never be able to become a merchant even after she grows up. &nbsp;So….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe returned the entirety of the 45 golds he received from Mycenae.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want one Mana potion and I want the rest to be Stamina potions.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Artpe! &nbsp;Are you using all of the money right now!? &nbsp;We could have lived off of that money! &nbsp;It would have lasted for our entire lifetime!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have the ability to earn money whenever you want. &nbsp;Moreover… &nbsp;It is a good idea to buy items that might spare our lives”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe spoke in a calm manner. &nbsp;Mycenae, who was facing him, smirked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In many ways, I have misjudged you. &nbsp;Please forgive my rudeness. &nbsp;I can give you 1 mid-grade Mana potion, and 8 Stamina potions. &nbsp;Will that be ok?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll be thankful if you added an additional Stamina potion on top of that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll give you an additional Mana potion too.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe’s eyebrows furrowed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aren’t you being a bit too generous?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She is being generous!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I believe you will become famous in the future. &nbsp;I’m just trying to gain a little bit of favor in your eyes. &nbsp;Please look kindly on the Anywhere company in the future. &nbsp;Thank you in advance.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk······.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mycenae laughed with unreadable eyes. &nbsp;She finally regained her composure as a middleman. &nbsp;Artpe didn’t like being in debt, but he was in a tight spot. &nbsp;He couldn’t punt her good intentions just because he wanted to.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, Artpe accepted the potions without hesitation. &nbsp;He took two Mana potion and one Stamina potion for himself. &nbsp;After he put them away inside his robe, he put the rest in a pouch before giving it to Maetel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You should drink it when you are extremely tired, or you can spray it on your wounds.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah-ooooooh. &nbsp;These are too expensive for me to use.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The most expensive thing in this world is your life. &nbsp;Will you be able to use it if I frame it that way?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Y…yes…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Maetel heard Artpe’s manly words, her cheeks turned slightly red as she meekly accepted the pouch with the potions. &nbsp;Mycenae was still watching them as she smirked. &nbsp;She bowed her head as a farewell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am Anywhere company's Mycenae. &nbsp;I’ll wait for the day when we’ll meet again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Be my guest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Goodbye for now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mycenae disappeared alongside the same light that had appeared in the beginning. &nbsp;Maetel wondered if this was all a dream, so she pinched her own cheeks. &nbsp;When she realized she still had on a completely different set of items, she knew this was real. &nbsp;She shook her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are too many things I still don’t know.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That is to be expected. &nbsp;As recompense, your talent for battle is outstanding.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But I want to have conversations with Artpe about a lot of different subjects….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You want to talk more than this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Matel was already not listening to Artpe’s words. Instead, she was making a firm resolve as she clenched her fists.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m going to do my best to read a lot of books from now on. &nbsp;I’ll become smart, so I can be of help to Artpe. &nbsp;I want to have many more conversations with Artpe….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uh. &nbsp;Mmmm. &nbsp;All right. &nbsp;You do your best.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t think it was a problem that could be solved by reading more books. &nbsp;Still, Artpe decided to cheer her on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Still, you should delay your plans on reading books. &nbsp;We’ll be entering the 7th floor of the Dungeon soon. &nbsp;The Skeletons will probably be stronger. &nbsp;If we don’t prepare our heart for what is to come, we’ll suffer defeat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can win against anyone. &nbsp;I’ll protect Artpe.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I like the fact that you are brave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He smirked as he stroked Maetel’s head. &nbsp;Then he plopped down on the floor. &nbsp;She tilted her head in confusion as she looked down at him. &nbsp;He announced his words in a solemn manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We have to sleep first before we proceed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They roughly rolled up a straw mat. &nbsp;They used it as a pillow as they laid down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if a Record Link was placed over this location, a Dungeon was a Dungeon. &nbsp;After a certain amount of time, new monsters would appear once again on the 6th floor. &nbsp;Of course, these monsters would be under the influence of the Record Link since the spell was still over the entire Dungeon. &nbsp;If the act of killing it once could break the Record Link, Artpe wouldn’t have had so much trouble manipulating it in the first place. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, he was pretty sure the new monsters wouldn’t show up on the 6th floor while they slept through the night. &nbsp;As a precaution, he pushed his hand forward to place Mana Threads in various locations around them. &nbsp;Maetel waited for his work to be done, then she pulled herself slightly closer to Artpe. &nbsp;She lay next to him. &nbsp;Artpe frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are too close.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I like this better, since it is warmer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened to your shyness?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I buried it in my house’s backyard before I came here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your house doesn’t have a backyard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel didn’t say any more words. &nbsp;She just snuggled closer to him. &nbsp;Since he couldn’t just push her away, he let her be. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh heh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have a long way to go. &nbsp;A long way…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Artpe~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel acted in a coquettish manner. &nbsp;It was hard to imagine that this girl had annihilated the Skeletons using the bastard sword. Her voice was that sweet. &nbsp;Artpe had made a resolve not to fall for her tricks, yet he found himself stroking her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had been in battle all day, and she hadn’t had the chance to wash herself. &nbsp;He couldn’t understand how she smelled so good. &nbsp;Artpe wondered if it was because she was still young. &nbsp;Artpe mused about such nonsensical thoughts as he closed his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dungeon’s 7th floor turned out to be more difficult rather than being easier than the 6th floor. &nbsp;The monsters of the Dungeon had realized that Artpe had messed up the Dungeon’s test, and its rules. &nbsp;They no longer acted as if they were testing the two of them. &nbsp;The monsters were filled with the desire to punish them for sullying the holy testing ground. &nbsp;This was why the monsters were more vicious in their attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On top of that, the monsters on this floor was higher in level than the ones on the 6th floor. &nbsp;They had an average level of 52, and there were about 600 Skeletons in total. &nbsp;These monsters mainly targeted Artpe, so Artpe didn’t have the chance to build up his Mana.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your existence is an insult to all the heroes, who existed before you!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[I cannot forgive you!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You won’t lay a hand on Artpe-ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had smashed the Skeletons for a whole day, yet they weren’t able to clear the floor. &nbsp;Fortunately, their levels had increased, so they could hold out for two to four days.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If possible, Artpe didn't want Maetel to use Berserk. &nbsp;He didn’t want to use the Mana Link either. &nbsp;However, these weren’t foes they could beat by holding their powers back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel relied on her Berserk Skill to repel the Skeletons coming at them from all sides. &nbsp;Artpe had no choice, but to provide her with Mana. &nbsp;At the same time, he was using his shield. &nbsp;He was getting better at using it as time passed. &nbsp;He used the shield boomerang to weaken his enemies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Koo-hahhhhhhhhhhk!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Artpe! &nbsp;These gloves and boots are really good! &nbsp;The Skeletons are easy to break using these items!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Maetel]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Level - 43]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Unarmed Combat Lv1]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Strike Lv3]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Monsters! &nbsp;They are cruel monsters! &nbsp;They are demons!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Give me death! &nbsp;I will become one with my comrades to punish you all!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll make all your comrades like you. &nbsp;Then I’ll break all of you at once. &nbsp;Wait a little bit!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Koo-ahhhhhhhhh!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>How much time had passed? &nbsp;Maetel and Artpe were entirely reliant on the Berserk skill and the Mana Link. &nbsp;They were barely able to beat all of the Skeletons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe felt the burden of knowing that he was probably weakening Maetel by sharing her talent. &nbsp;However, unlike his worries, all of Maetel’s skills continued to evolve at a ridiculous pace. &nbsp;This was also true for Artpe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, it was impossible to last a couple of days using nothing. &nbsp;They had to use most of the potions they had purchased. &nbsp;Fortunately, they would once again encounter a Dungeon Merchant at the end of the 7th floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh my. &nbsp;It has been only couple days, but we meet again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s this ajumma again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not an ajumma! &nbsp;….huhk. &nbsp;Isn’t that the Golden Lizard’s Tailbone Great Sword!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“97 gold.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ggoo-ahhhhhhhhk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was how the heroes were able to safely retool before they entered the 8th floor. &nbsp;Still, the Dungeon remained very difficult. &nbsp;Artpe wasn’t the creator of this Dungeon, so he had no idea how many floors had been separated using the Record Link.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They moved through the Dungeon’s 8th floor, 9th floor, 10th floor, 11th floor, 13th floor, 15th floor…. &nbsp;&nbsp;The Dungeon continued to go on and on. &nbsp;The average level of the Skeletons continued to go up by a marginal amount, and at a certain point, Artpe and Maetel surpassed the level of the Skeletons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since they held the advantage in level, they thought they would be able to win easily from that point forward. &nbsp;Right when they had this thought, powerful monsters over level 100 started to appear. &nbsp;The monsters were called ghouls. &nbsp;The level difference between the party and the monsters widened in the favor of the monsters, so they were put in a difficult spot once again. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, there weren’t any mountains they couldn’t overcome. &nbsp;Before they even engaged in a fight, Artpe was able to find all the weaknesses of his enemies. &nbsp;Then there was the the crazy talented Maetel, who could bring anything he ordered into reality!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was how a period of one year had passed, and the party reached the Dungeon’s 34th floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How long is this Dungeon!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Group fights are fun, Artpe! &nbsp;Isn’t it about time for a different type of monsters to come out?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Customer! &nbsp;Please sell this to me for 200 gold just this one time! &nbsp;Please!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that point, Maetel had reached level 124. &nbsp;Artpe had reached level 115.</span></p>
