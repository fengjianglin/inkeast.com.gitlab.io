 <p>Chapter 8 - Dungeon with Death (4)</p>
 <p><span style>The fact that the Skeletons were running at incredible speed meant that the effect of the collision was that much more powerful. &nbsp;The Skeletons impacted against each other as they became tangled. &nbsp;The ones that were impacted hard died. &nbsp;Artpe had come up with this idea in the spur of the moment, yet his plan had been incredibly effective!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, it is much more efficient in terms of Mana and time to use a magic spell that produces the same result.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Artpe is amazing.!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, yes. &nbsp;I am amazing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two of them had effectively blocked the rush attempt by the Skeletons, and they were able to arrive at the 1st floor. &nbsp;Of course, he had destroyed the stairway leading to the 1st floor in spectacular fashion. &nbsp;The regular Skeletons had to be made into stepping stones for the Skeleton Warrior to reach the 1st floor. &nbsp;In the end, only four Skeleton including the Elite Skeleton Warrior made it up to the 1st floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The zombies aren’t back yet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We killed them all. &nbsp;Other adventurers have to enter and die here for there to be new zombies.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t want to know about such truths…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Gwuhhhhhhhhhh!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, hurry. &nbsp;Hurry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Leave it to me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She carried a boy, who weighed more than her, through the Dungeon. &nbsp;She ran from the 6th floor to the 1st floor. &nbsp;It was as if his weight was negligible to her. &nbsp;Then there was the boy, who kept impeding the progress of the monsters using his Mana Control and magic spells. &nbsp;If others saw this sight, they would have been in disbelief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if their levels were high, their actual bodies, which used these abilities, were immature. &nbsp;Artpe spoke as if what they had done was nothing special, but he was looking at it through the standard of the Demon race, not humans!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We are almost there. &nbsp;We are almost at the entrance!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry up! &nbsp;They are just around the corner!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[I’ll kill humans! &nbsp;I’ll kill humans!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed the Hyper Rubbing from before had caused a lot of damage. &nbsp;The Skeleton Warrior’s shield had a fairly large crack. &nbsp;He could see small thread-like fissures on its skull. &nbsp;If someone had told him the Skeleton Warrior had been in a battle before coming here, he would have believed it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Killllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it hadn’t been a true fight. &nbsp;It had been damaged this much by simply slipping and falling hard on the floor. &nbsp;This fact probably probably fueling its anger. &nbsp;There actually was a red energy blanketing its body. &nbsp;&nbsp;Artpe was sure it was a Buff type skill that allowed it to temporarily raise its abilities. &nbsp;It was triggered by its heightened emotional state. &nbsp;It was only an Undead, yet it had an Emotion type skill!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eeek. &nbsp;I’m falling behind. &nbsp;We aren’t going to make it… &nbsp;Artpe~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk. &nbsp;It can’t be helped.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He replied in a relaxed manner, but his Mana was close to being depleted. &nbsp;It would be impossible for him to once again make the entire length of the hallway slippery to stop the Skeletons. &nbsp;If so…..</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh-eet!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kyahhhk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe unfurled his hand as he manifested his magic. &nbsp;At that moment, Maetel slid down the hallway with Artpe on her back. &nbsp;To be precise, the path in front of them had turned smooth. &nbsp;It was as if the dirt hallway was pulling them forward!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel realized Artpe was using his magic in front of them, so she was cautious as she tried her best not to fall over. &nbsp;Then she used the slick floor to propel herself forward. &nbsp;This girl’s talent was really endless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Humaaaaaaaaans!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We are going to die. &nbsp;We are going to d…...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ve arrived!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he ran out of magic, the two of them were suddenly thrown forward towards the entrance of the Dungeon. &nbsp;Afterwards, the Skeleton Warrior’s bastard sword passed through the location where Artpe’s head used to be. &nbsp;Several strands of his hair was cut as it flew into the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Koo-ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How dare you cut Artpe’s hair! &nbsp;I won’t forgive you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Calm down!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel had taken out her club, and she was about to charge the Skeleton Warrior. &nbsp;Artpe desperately tried to hold her back. &nbsp;Afterwards, Maetel realized something weird had occurred.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...what is it doing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What does it look like it is doing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a boundary that separated the Dungeon’s entrance from the 1st room. &nbsp;The Skeleton Warrior grinded its teeth as it swung its sword, but it stood beyond the boundary. &nbsp;Of course, the party had already entered into the Dungeon’s entrance, so the bastard sword couldn’t reach them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We are right in front of them, so why aren’t they coming….?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Dungeon’s monsters can’t come out to the Dungeon’s entrance.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah. &nbsp;I’m sure Artpe explained this to me before! &nbsp;So that is why they can’t come out even though they are right in front of us?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Skeleton underling had already fallen to the floor in exhaustion. &nbsp;Only the Skeleton Warrior kept swinging its sword as if it held lingering resentment towards them. &nbsp;Still, it looked less spirited compared to when it first showed up. &nbsp;It looked a bit lacking… </span></p>
 <p><span style>“So what is the reason behind it? &nbsp;I really don’t know, Artpe! &nbsp;How come? &nbsp;Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Those are some very good questions.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe laughed in a kind manner as he answered her question. &nbsp;Of course, as he spoke, he was gathering Mana into his dagger to attack the silly Skeleton Warrior.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know either!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah-ha. &nbsp;I see!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was why it was convenient to have a dummy next to you!</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Kill! &nbsp;Kill! &nbsp;Kill!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. &nbsp;I want you to keep talking like that!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe replied in a friendly manner towards the Skeleton Warrior, whose words were filled with resentment and anger. &nbsp;He continued to gather his Mana. &nbsp;He had consumed an incredible amount of Mana, but he was recovering a fair amount by standing still.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was something to be expected during his time as a Demon, but now he was a human child. &nbsp;This was atypical. &nbsp;He had the body of a human, yet his affinity with Mana was off the chart. &nbsp;Even if he used his Read All Creation ability, he couldn’t figure out why he was like this. &nbsp;He just decided to think of this as a boon. </span></p>
 <p><span style>[I’ll kill humans! Kill! &nbsp;I’ll kill…. &nbsp;I give up.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey hey. &nbsp;Don’t give up now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Skeleton Warrior had swung his bastard sword for a long time, but in the end, it came to a realization that it wouldn’t be able to cross into the Dungeon’s entrance. &nbsp;In front of this reality, it had been about to give up. &nbsp;This was when Artpe threw a Mana infused dagger toward it as he spoke words of encouragement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe was able to see the flight path of the dagger, since it was letting out a blue Mana that could only be seen by Artpe. &nbsp;The Mana flooded forward as the dagger embedded itself on top of the Skeleton Warrior’s head. &nbsp;&nbsp;When the Skeleton Warrior had fallen from the Hyper Rubbing spell, the other Skeletons had crashed into it. &nbsp;It caused a thread-like fissure to form on its skull. &nbsp;The dagger had accurately burrowed into the fissure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Koo-ahhhhhhhhh! &nbsp;I’ll kill you!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes! &nbsp;That’s the right idea!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Artpe. &nbsp;You are so bad…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fire, which had been dimming, with the Skeleton Warrior started to burn white hot again. &nbsp;It had felt impotent before, but now it renewed its resolve. &nbsp;It diligently swung its sword. &nbsp;Artpe kept nodding his head as if to cheer on the Skeleton Warrior. &nbsp;He continued to recover his Mana. &nbsp;Maetel finally realized Artpe’s tactic, so she asked with a dumbfounded look in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Artpe. &nbsp;I’m not talented at attacking from a distance. &nbsp;What should I do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can’t do anything here. &nbsp;You should just eat the dry ration.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel busily ate the rations and water. &nbsp;As expected, she had consumed a lot of Stamina by running from the 6th floor to the 1st floor, while carrying Artpe. &nbsp;While she ate, he diligently gathered Mana, and he infused it into another dagger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the process of traversing the 6 floors, they had found articles left behind by the deceased adventurers, who had died over countless years. &nbsp;They had also found the treasure chests. &nbsp;This was why Artpe had an ample supply of throwing weapons. &nbsp;He didn’t have to worry about running out of weapons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Human! Humaaaaaaaaan! &nbsp;I give up!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, you can do this!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[I can’t do this!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t believe yourself! &nbsp;I want you to believe in me, who believes in you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“······.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Skeleton Warrior kept swinging its sword, but it was mired in the feeling of hopelessness. &nbsp;Artpe had to keep attacking it. &nbsp;He had to keep it distracted. &nbsp;Maetel was watching a human and an Undead converse. &nbsp;She decided not to think too deeply about this. &nbsp;The important point right now was the fact that Artpe had brilliantly embedded four daggers into its body..</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All right. &nbsp;This is going smoothly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Goo-ahhhhhhhh! &nbsp;I give up!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You suffered at the hands of children, who haven’t even reached half your level. &nbsp;Are you really going to run away now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Kooooooooooooooo!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>If the Skeleton Warrior simply stayed here, Artpe would play around with it until it died. &nbsp;Unfortunately, the Skeleton Warrior’s intelligence wasn’t that high. &nbsp;Above all else, the Skeleton Warrior was in the grip of the Rage Buff.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Buff was triggered by an emotion. &nbsp;The pros of a Buff skill was the fact that it didn’t consume a lot of magical energy, yet it increased one’s level significantly. &nbsp;If there was a downside, it was the fact that it was hard to break out of the emotion that had activated the Buff. &nbsp;This was why the Skeleton Warrior was unable to give up on the battle. &nbsp;&nbsp;It kept following the lead of Artpe for no particular reason than that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Take more of this! &nbsp;More! &nbsp;I’m sure you can do this longer, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Humannnnnnn! &nbsp;I’ll kill you! I’ll kill you!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm. &nbsp;Its aggro is still fixed on us…...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Artpe?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were eight daggers stuck inside the body of the Skeleton Warrior. &nbsp;Artpe still had plenty of throwing weapons left, but he stopped throwing them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If we use this method to kill it, it’ll take us around four days.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then are we going to give up? &nbsp;I think we can go out now! &nbsp;I’m not afraid of the soldiers or the goblins!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After filling her stomach, she had recovered her energy. &nbsp;Maetel spoke in a valiant manner. &nbsp;In reality, it had only been a week, but their growth could almost be called an evolution. &nbsp;They could evade the soldiers, and it wouldn’t be too difficult to fight couple dozen of them and win! &nbsp;However, Artpe shook his head in a decisive manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The probability of us running into an Elite monster is very low. &nbsp;Of course, this bastard is a strong and difficult opponent. &nbsp;However, when we kill it, the reward will be enormous. &nbsp;We can’t give up. &nbsp;This is too good of an opportunity to miss.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In his previous life, Artpe would have snorted in disdain towards a reward given by a level 60 Elite monster. &nbsp;&nbsp;However, he was a level 24 beginner hero right now, and the only magic spell he knew was Hyper Rubbing. &nbsp;It was stupid to retreat when they had the chance to kill their enemy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Moreover, this Dungeon itself keeps weighing on my mind….’</span></p>
 <p><span style>This place started with level 5 beginner monsters, yet a level 60 Elite monster had appeared on the 6th floor. &nbsp;This beginner’s Dungeon was hard to pin down. &nbsp;What was at the end of this Dungeon? &nbsp;What caused it to be so strange? &nbsp;These thoughts troubled him, so he couldn’t ignore it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He possessed the Read All Creation ability, so Artpe had always known most of the answers before he could formulate a question &nbsp;The was no end in sight to this Dungeon, and it interested him. &nbsp;Of course, he couldn’t deny the fact that there was danger here. &nbsp;However, if Artpe and Maetel were able to successfully conquer the Dungeon, they would gain a reward equal to the difficulty of the Dungeon. &nbsp;At the very least, it would be much better than being fattened up like pigs in the castle. &nbsp;It was better than rotting away there. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So let’s just change our method.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is it finally my time to step forward!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, you still can’t do anything against it. &nbsp;Just sit there and cheer for me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heeng.”“</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, Artpe’s thoughts led him towards an unexpected destination. &nbsp;It ended at his Hyper Rubbing magic. &nbsp;When he acquired it, he had thought it was a useless magic that could only cause friction. &nbsp;However, the magic had somehow saved them twice in their time of need. &nbsp;He had rubbed to cause changes to the terrain, and he rubbed to increase Maetel’s speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unlike his initial assessment of this magic, this spell wasn’t simple. &nbsp;The most important aspect to pay attention to was the fact that it was able to cause a very large change to the environment compared to the amount of Mana being consumed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is why…. &nbsp;Maybe....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe looked at the eight daggers embedded deeply into the Skeleton Warrior’s skull and other joints. &nbsp;When he checked the Mana within the daggers, his eyes shone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wondered if this this plan would really work. &nbsp;Still, they couldn’t keep playing games in front of the Dungeon’s entrance. &nbsp;He went about this with a devil-may-care attitude. &nbsp;He chanted his spell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My will shall manifest focused on the edge of the blade! &nbsp;Hyper Rubbing!”</span></p>
