 <p>Chapter 39 - Hero VS Kingdom (1)</p>
 <p><span style>Fortunately, Mycenae quickly restocked her supply of magic books after selling them in bulk to Artpe. &nbsp;All of them were sold to Artpe once again. &nbsp;It was a total of five books. &nbsp;She was reliable in the fact that she had acquired the Cleaning magic(45 gold).</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You guys should all gather around me. &nbsp;Cleaning!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was cleaned in an instant!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My clothes are so soft and fluffy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the moment when Artpe took a step forward in becoming a lifestyle magician. &nbsp;Of course, a normal lifestyle magician couldn’t clean a large group of over 300 people at once. &nbsp;Mycenae turned pale at the sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have a really large amount of Mana. &nbsp;Are you around level 300?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I told you not to dig in too much, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe’s current level was 163. &nbsp;If he went by the standard of the Read All Creation ability, his Magic Points was above 800. &nbsp;It was the Magic Points he had in his previous life at level 200.</span></p>
 <p><span style>By that time, Artpe had already begun serving under the Demon King, and he had learned all the spells available. &nbsp;Of course, one had to take into consideration that Demon race naturally had overwhelmingly more magical energy. &nbsp;This was why the amount of magical energy he possessed right now was absurd.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had been a demon in his previous life, but that was a flimsy explanation as to why he possessed so much magical right now. &nbsp;Artpe had been born with exceptional talent for magic, and it was at a level where the only plausible explanation was the fact that he was a hero.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he dwelled more on that thought, it felt as if he would become conceited by it. &nbsp;Therefore, he abandoned thinking about that subject. &nbsp;&nbsp;Conceit was the factor that always killed the Four Heavenly Kings! &nbsp;This was why he changed the subject.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you do with Silpennon?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even if I’m performing a scheduled task, I couldn’t stay away when the customers I am in charge of had just cleared another Dungeon. &nbsp;However…. &nbsp;I’m guessing this wasn’t a run of the mill Dungeon?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When did ajumma became in charge of us as clients….. &nbsp;Well, it clearly isn’t normal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was a Dungeon Merchant, but this didn’t mean she had all the information regarding the Dungeon she will visit next. &nbsp;The Dungeon Merchants were given permission to mobilize when a pacified Dungeon had hidden treasures.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s been awhile since the Dungeon Owner was exchanged from a monster to human. &nbsp;He had the Dungeon barrier up······ Since he is dead, it should have dissipated.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mycenae looked over the children gathered in this space, and she immediately picked up on what was going on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah-ha. &nbsp;So that’s what they were aiming for….. &nbsp;&nbsp;Oh wow. &nbsp;You were able to break it up. &nbsp;I’ll have to revise my opinion of you again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t have to revise it. No, just don’t look at me at all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are too much!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel had killed him too quickly, but the black magician was around level 100. &nbsp;Normally, beginner heroes shouldn’t be able to take down a level 100 being! &nbsp;Maetel had shown enough force to kill a level 200 with a single blow. &nbsp;The black magician had been unlucky in facing Maetel as an opponent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, even after Maetel had defeated the black magician, the monsters and the children who could turn into demons were still present. &nbsp;Mycenae was able to make her appearance only after Artpe got rid of all the potential risk factors.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Customer, you surely aren’t thinking about ending our transaction after buying the spell books? &nbsp;I’m sure you are going to share in the Dungeon rewards with me, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were two types of Dungeons. &nbsp;There was the naturally occurring Dungeons and the artificial Dungeons. &nbsp;This Dungeon was a naturally occurring Dungeon. &nbsp;The magician who took over this place was proficient at black magic, but he hadn’t been talented at Dungeon exploration. &nbsp;This was why all the secret traps and rewards remained untouched.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was what Mycenae was aiming for. &nbsp;Of course, since she had been able to find the items, Artpe would be able to find them too. &nbsp;This was why she decided to give up on fruitlessly searching further for more items. &nbsp;She wanted to immediately enter into a business transaction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, if so…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe looked at his surrounding. &nbsp;The level of the black magician, who had taken over this Dungeon, had to be discounted. &nbsp;It looked as if the original Dungeon boss had been a weak monster. &nbsp;Still, it wasn’t as if Artpe could not find any compensation using his Read All Creation ability.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m hungry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My stomach keeps growling.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, there was a problem that he had to deal with before he gathered the Dungeon rewards. &nbsp;He looked at the children who looked as if they could drop at any moment. &nbsp;Artpe sighed as he threw a gold coin towards Mycenae.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“First, I want you to give them something to eat. &nbsp;The children were starved for couple days, so I want you to give them food that wouldn’t be too much of a burden on them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh my. &nbsp;You are so kind. &nbsp;As it happens, I have a consumable item that was developed by the mage tower to be used on war refugees. &nbsp;However, there is a single down side…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll give you an additional gold.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As always, thank you very much, customer!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mycenae distributed the items to the children with the help of Maetel and Aena. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sienna had experienced a sudden physical change. She was changed into an existence that didn’t get hungry much. &nbsp;This was why Sienna helped out in the distribution. &nbsp;Of course, Mycenae showed interest in her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh my. &nbsp;You have very pretty hair.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want you to give me an artifact that can conceal her identity.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was wondering why you haven’t asked me about that. &nbsp;You always seems to meet people of suspect origin. &nbsp;Or maybe those kinds of people are drawn to you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe snorted at Mycenae’s words as he went around the communal space. &nbsp;Every time he disturbed a location a wooden box would suddenly appear out of thin air or the lichen growing in the cracks of the Dungeon’s wall would let out a strange light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He went to four locations to gather the rewards, but as expected, they weren’t worth much.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It should be around 29 gold.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, here is your 29 gold. &nbsp;Also, this is a bonus for my dear customer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe handed off all the items, and he received a small hairpin from her. &nbsp;It was a metal adornment shaped like a butterfly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This stops the magical energy reaction from leaking out. &nbsp;The artifact has a very simple function, but it should be enough for the girl.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mycenae had decided this item was enough for Sienna. &nbsp;Her hair and skin was unusual, but it could be dismissed as being not too out of the ordinary for a girl of her age.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want one Crystal Ball of Blessing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Artpe had other ideas.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You want that too!? &nbsp;Is it because this child is a demon?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mycenae was shocked. &nbsp;She tried to get a closer look at Sienna, but Artpe didn’t allow any further inquiry. &nbsp;In the end, Mycenae pouted as she handed him a Crystal Ball of Blessing for 500 gold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, this is the end to our transaction. &nbsp;You should head back for now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How can you push me out so coldly every time like this? &nbsp;Still, I won’t give up. &nbsp;I’ll someday make you the king of the business world! &nbsp;You better be prepared for it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ajumma, don’t try to steal Artpe!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I told you to stop doing that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Mycenae made another loud commotion, he put away the Crystal Ball of Blessing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sienna stared at him as she asked him a question</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oppa, what is that for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed she had become sensitive to Mana when she was turned into a Evil Reflector. &nbsp;It seemed she was very interested in the artifact.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe let out a small laugh as he stroked her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll tell you about it a little bit later.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A short amount of time had passed. &nbsp;All the children were brought outside, and Artpe returned the children to the townspeople. &nbsp;In a flash, a reunion filled with tears occurred….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mommyyyyy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Son! &nbsp;M...my son!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fortunately, most of the children taken from this particular town were all safe. &nbsp;The townspeople were deeply moved by the return of the children, so they started praising Artpe and Maetel. However, Artpe gave them a warning as he looked at them with serious eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you spread our name, I’ll put a curse on all of you. &nbsp;The curse will turn you into frogs.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heek!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Heroes were always targeted by repeat Quests, and these Quests would cheapen the value of their names! &nbsp;Of course, the Demon King had created a perfect recipe in the past where these repeat Quests helped along the explosive growth of the hero as an unintended consequence. &nbsp;However, the current situation differed quite a lot from the past.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since he was now aware of the fact that Demon King was hatching such a horrifying plan, they would have to move carefully. &nbsp;A disguise and a mask was a must. &nbsp;They also had to be prepared to bury such fake identities in the darkness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The problem is…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe gave a stern warning then he turned around. &nbsp;There were still couple hundred children left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hyung, I want to see my mom too.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“B...be quiet. &nbsp;We shouldn’t cause more trouble for the magician-nim!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heeng. &nbsp;Mom. &nbsp;Mommy~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had no problem with the children who were originally from this town. &nbsp;However, he wondered what he should do with the children captured from the other towns.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, they would have to be returned to their own towns. &nbsp;If he was like the heroes from the old stories, he wouldn’t have hesitated. &nbsp;He would have personally returned the children to each town. &nbsp;However, the Quest had ended, so he needed to move onto his next goal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>·····this kind of event always led to a more annoying and larger incidents. &nbsp;The Demon King’s scheme always seemed to come in succession!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, the Demon King was a chef that tried to get a richer flavor by cooking an already seared meat once again….. &nbsp;Artpe was well aware of the Demon King’s far-reaching recipes, so he was annoyed at being at the receiving end of it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I have to nip this in the bud. &nbsp;It would be stupid of me to be satisfied with leaving the matter as is when I know more will come from this. &nbsp;Moreover….’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, Artpe came to a firm resolution.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he let his heart make the decision, he would have ended his association with the townspeople here. &nbsp;He wanted to go rest. &nbsp;However, if he didn’t tie this up right now, he knew he would become more exhausted by what stemmed from this event in the future.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You guys should move your town.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, a suggestion popped out of his mouth. &nbsp;The townspeople became dumbfounded at his words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You want us to move our town? &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;No, how?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll be going around to the towns where these children are from. &nbsp;I’ll be gathering all the townspeople from there. &nbsp;I want to consolidate everyone into forming a large town. &nbsp;&nbsp;You guys will create a small city.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W...we can’t do that!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’ll be too hard!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We are already living a hard life here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He expected their objections. &nbsp;However, Artpe’s attitude didn’t change.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you want your children to be stolen again, you can continue on living here. &nbsp;You all have to stick together right now. &nbsp;You have to stick together to grow your numbers. &nbsp;You won’t be able to win against a country, but at the very least, you will have grown your own presence. &nbsp;You have to be large enough where many people will become aware it if something happens to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If enough humans were gathered in a single location, it might have an effect on other entities. &nbsp;It would be hard for the Archduke to mess with them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It would also make it harder for the Demon King’s army to hatch a scheme. &nbsp;They were able to gather and put a curse on the children as experiments, because they were able to steal the children in secret.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I...if we move our residences, how are we going to feed ourselves?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You already had a hard time making a living here. &nbsp;Do you think much will change if you move? &nbsp;You’ll either farm or hunt for game. &nbsp;That isn’t my problem.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe had other things to do. &nbsp;He had to ruin the Archduke. &nbsp;Furthermore, he had to ruin the black magicians that were messing with the entire country.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the climax of this Quest, couple Demons would probably make their appearances. &nbsp;However, he was confident that he could kill them. &nbsp;Maetel had awoken to her Innate ability. &nbsp;It would be possible to do so with her help!</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’ll have to ruin a kingdom before I kill the Demon King. &nbsp;Mmmm. &nbsp;All right. &nbsp;I kind of feel like a Four Heavenly King again.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn’t shake the feeling that something was out of joint. &nbsp;However, this actually made him quite happy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel looked at him with unshakable trust, and Sienna looked up at him as if he was her idol. &nbsp;Aena and the numerous children looked on with worried eyes. &nbsp;The townspeople looked to be in a state of shock and fear at Artpe’s forceful order.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, we’ll start our city construction plan from this point on!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was at that moment when the first Quest turned into a succession of scenario Quest.</span></p>
