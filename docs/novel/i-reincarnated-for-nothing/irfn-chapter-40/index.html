 <p>Chapter 40 - Hero VS Kingdom (2)</p>
 <p><span style>Under Artpe’s unexpected edict, the townspeople made preparations to leave. &nbsp;They were close to tears. &nbsp;Since they had given up most of their fortunes to Artpe(there wasn’t much aside from Obsidian of Greed), so they only had to pack some clothes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ll sleep here tonight, and we’ll head out immediately tomorrow. &nbsp;I want all of you to take care of the children until then.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood, magician-nim.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ho-ooh. &nbsp;I know magician-nim isn’t wrong, but the prospect of building a new house is frustrating…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It would have been better if they had grounds to dismiss Artpe’s claims as total nonsense. &nbsp;However, Artpe had brought back the children even when he wasn’t given much as a reward. &nbsp;This was why they decided to pin their trust upon him..</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was why they continued their preparation for their big migration even as they shed tears. &nbsp;Their hearts burned as if &nbsp;they had eaten mustard. Still, it was better to be worked like a dog than actually being dead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll see you tomorrow, oppa!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good night, noona!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hoo-uhng, ooh-uh-uhng. &nbsp;Mommy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, Artpe knew their pain. &nbsp;How could he not? &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>He watched the townspeople people break up as they shuttled the crying children away. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If they do band together to grow in size, there’s a chance they’ll be able to escape the influence of the demons. &nbsp;Of course, when that occurs they’ll try to find other ways to acquire more children….,...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe and Maetel’s role was to stop this business from getting any larger. &nbsp;He would overlooked most calamities. &nbsp;However, he had to get in on this or it might swallow the whole human world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is the hero’s walk of life. &nbsp;If not for heroes, others wouldn’t be able to sense such enormous crisis, and they wouldn’t know how to overcome it. &nbsp;It isn’t as if the human world doesn’t have strong people. &nbsp;However, the trouble makers are hidden until the heroes can find them. &nbsp;It is like a game of hide and seek.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the hero finds them, they proudly reveal themselves as if to say ‘I’m ready now!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were sons of bitches amongst sons of bitches.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you think this is happening in other regions, Artpe?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I hope not, but it is possible. &nbsp;This is why this is so annoying.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At Artpe’s reply, Maetel’s eyes turned menacing. &nbsp;Since this was a problem where his safety wasn’t involved, he had expected her to laugh off most of his words. &nbsp;She had a very forgiving nature, yet her face was filled with rage right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We have to beat them up. &nbsp;Everyone who tries to make children into monsters are bad!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed her mental attitude had gone through a fundamental change after what she experienced within the Dungeon. &nbsp;Artpe was bitter and happy about it at the same time. &nbsp;Still, he had to calm her down right now. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You shouldn’t work yourself up too much, Maetel… &nbsp;&nbsp;You’ll see much worse in the future.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel didn’t reply to his words. &nbsp;She extended her hand to firmly grip his sleeve. &nbsp;He extended a hand to stroke her head. &nbsp;At that moment, another girl grabbed his other sleeve.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was none other than Sienna.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oppa. &nbsp;Oppa should come to our house and sleep.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, magician-nim. &nbsp;Our humble…. &nbsp;It is a very humble house, but if you don’t mind, we will take you in for the night.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel sent a guarded look towards the two girls. &nbsp;The hand that had been petting her head suddenly turned into a light blow to her head with his knuckles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ouch.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Maetel gripped her head in pain, Artpe grabbed Sienna’s offered hand as he gave his reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ll impose ourselves on you guys for a day. &nbsp;As it happens, I have something I have to give you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really? Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sienna let out an innocent laugh as she rejoiced.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe couldn’t help but laugh alongside with her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He would have to sweet talk another girl with a plausible story.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was how he came to reside in the two girl’s house for a night. They had lost their parents, so the two girls lived in a very small and old house. &nbsp;It was in disrepair. &nbsp;&nbsp;It would actually be much less work to build a new hut than repair this one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he unpacked his gear, Artpe called for Sienna. He gave her a small crystal ball. &nbsp;It was none other than the Crystal Ball of Blessing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Here, take it. &nbsp;This is yours.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oppa, you bought it for me!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sienna hadn’t figured out the exact use of the Crystal Ball of Blessing yet. &nbsp;However &nbsp;she was sensitive to Mana after she became an Evil Reflector. &nbsp;This was why she was aware that a very complex structure of Mana was contained within the Crystal Ball of Blessing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oppa, isn’t this really expensive?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not giving it to you for free. &nbsp;You have to repay me later with a lot of interests. &nbsp;It’ll be a compound interest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, I understand!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since she didn’t know how scary compound interest was, Sienna let out a naive smile as she replied. &nbsp;She took the crystal from him. &nbsp;Soon, she had a slightly peculiar expression on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oppa, it feels as if it is exploring inside me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is a substitute for the priests, and it’ll decide your future path. &nbsp;It’ll make a record of you in this world. &nbsp;You’ll know when it adapts to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Y...yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After awakening as an Evil Reflector, she had already learned the Mana Control. &nbsp;Of course, he expected her to receive the Magician Class without much problem</span></p>
 <p><span style>However….</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Sienna]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Level ? 1]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Evil Reflector]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Warrior Priestess]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“······?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“······?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sienna found out her Class, and when he saw it, Artpe’s eyes turned round. &nbsp;Maetel and Aena didn’t know what was going on so they looked on absentmindedly. &nbsp;The only thing different was the fact that the crystal ball was know glinting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It would probably be of help in advancing in her high rank Class….. No, that wasn’t important right now!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oppa, what happened······?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not sure either.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If she wasn’t a magician, who on this land was actually suited to become a mage! &nbsp;&nbsp;Moroever, she had escaped her humanity to become a new race that didn’t exist in history, yet she was a priestess!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe was so taken aback by this that he wanted to run out of the house. &nbsp;However, his Read All Creation ability hadn’t malfunctioned. &nbsp;Instead, her record as a Warrior Priestess was show clearly in front of his eyes. &nbsp;There was no double &nbsp;Sienna was a Warrior Priestess!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sienna firmly grabbed Artpe’s clothes as she asked him a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oppa, does this mean I have to enter into a temple?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You must never do that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At Sienna’s naive question, Artpe gave an immediate answer. &nbsp;Even if a Warrior Priestess was an occupation welcomed by everyone, she wasn’t human anymore. &nbsp;There was no way she would be able to enter into the very close-minded temples. If Artpe thought about their temperament, it would be fortunate if Sienna wasn’t dissected for study.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Priests weren’t priests, because they had a good heart. &nbsp;Priests followed a specific way of training that had been passed down through time. &nbsp;People had researched a way to suck up to selfish gods in an attempt to obtain a boon from them. &nbsp;This was how the they awakened to the holy power to become priests!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was why she was in a impossible situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Her Mana has progressed in a special direction. &nbsp;It’s a holy power that directly opposes evil…. &nbsp;It is a likely hypothesis.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The name of her race was Evil Reflector, and the name was quite explicit. &nbsp;It also outlined the direction of her development. &nbsp;She had been optimized to fight against the demon race. &nbsp;She was so amazing that it wouldn’t have been strange if she had been chosen as hero.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wonder what would happen if she was given the opportunity to grow up. &nbsp;She was born from an experiment that had tried to turn her into a demon. &nbsp;She would now stand in the front line in defeating the Demon race. &nbsp;It was the biggest way to screw over the Demon King. &nbsp;Moreover, it would allow Artpe’s original goal to…...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“······Sienna.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe felt a small amount of self-hatred as he bit his lips. However, he had already handed over the Crystal Ball of Blessing to her, so he was being hypocritical by wavering between his decision. &nbsp;He kept eye contact with Sienna as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You probably lived a normal life until now. &nbsp;If this incident hadn’t occurred, you would have continued to live a normal life. &nbsp;However, the direction of your life has changed in no uncertain terms. &nbsp;In the process, you gained considerable amount of power and potential. &nbsp;Now that you have that power it’ll be hard for you to lead a normal life.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the very least, it wouldn’t be possible until the disturbance caused by the Demon King could be put to sleep. &nbsp;Sienna was a very bright child, so she fully understood what Artpe was talking about.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. &nbsp;Thank you, oppa. &nbsp;I also want to live a different life. &nbsp;I want to become stronger like oppa. &nbsp;I don’t want to be abused by bad people any longer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was truly courageous words. &nbsp;Artpe wonder if what she experienced here had hardened her heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maybe, her mental state was affected when she was changed into a new race. &nbsp;He just had to hope that he had led her down a better path than becoming a demon..</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The problem is the power you possess is different from theirs. &nbsp;The power is unique and alien. &nbsp;This is the reason why I gave you the Crystal Ball of Blessing. &nbsp;People are afraid of those that are different from them. &nbsp;You’ll probably be unable to display your full power out in the open.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oppa, what should I do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She went to the heart of the matter. &nbsp;As Sienna asked her question, it seemed she had an idea what the answer would be. &nbsp;This was why there was a look of anticipation on her face. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was why kids these days were scary. &nbsp;Artpe had this though as he turned to look at Maetel. &nbsp;It looked as if Maetel really didn’t like the current situation. &nbsp;In the end, she nodded with a sullen expression on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She didn’t want someone else to get between Artpe and her. &nbsp;However, Maetel knew Sienna couldn’t be left behind now. &nbsp;Since her feelings were so transparent, it was a bit amusing to see it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe smirked as he turned to look at Sienna.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he suggested a way forward for her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“······do you want to join our party?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As if she had been waiting for this question, she let out a bright smile as she gave her answer. &nbsp;Artpe had asked the question, but he was taken aback by her embarrassingly frank answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“······your whole life depends on this decision. &nbsp;Are you sure you ok making such a decision so easily?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can’t!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Aena interjected herself into the conversation as she screeched. &nbsp;She had finally been able to recover her younger sister, yet she was now worried that Sienna would go to a distant place. &nbsp;However, Sienna had anticipated her unni’s objection, so she spoke with a bright smile on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Unni, don’t worry too much about it. &nbsp;I’m all right. &nbsp;As time passes, I’ll feel much better.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sienna······.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you are with me, I’m sure it’ll become difficult for you. &nbsp;You saw it, unni. &nbsp;I’m not normal anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As her words ended, a white magical energy was emitted at the tip of Siennna’s fingers. &nbsp;Artpe could clearly see a light that was similar to holy power. &nbsp;Moreover, the amount of magical energy possessed by her was disparate from her status as a level 1.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I...I...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Unni. &nbsp;You can do this alone too, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Aena’s expression darkened, but Sienna’s expression remained clear. &nbsp;There was a thread of resoluteness that could be seen in her bright smile. &nbsp;Aena realized Sienna wasn’t trying to convince her of anything. &nbsp;She was just notifying Aena of what would be happening. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sienna had always been a fierce girl that spoke her mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We won’t be apart forever. &nbsp;I’ll come back. &nbsp;I promise. &nbsp;So you have to wait for me. &nbsp;Ok?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sienna…. &nbsp;Are you really going to come back to me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, Aena declared her defeat. &nbsp;Sienna let out a bright laughter as she tightly hugged Aena.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, I promise.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sienna······!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is quite a nice sight, so I’m sorry to have to say this. &nbsp;We are going to travel together until this Quest ends.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah. &nbsp;That’s right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe poured vinegar on the situation. &nbsp;The two sisters had embarrassed expressions on their faces.&nbsp; Maetel giggled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The night came to an end in a town that’ll be gone tomorrow.</span></p>
