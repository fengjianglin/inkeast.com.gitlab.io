 <p>Chapter 7 - Dungeon with Death (3)</p>
 <p><span style>As they explored the 6th floor of the Dungeon, Artpe was gradually feeling an odd sensation. &nbsp;No matter how he thought about it this Dungeon was too long.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What kind of Dungeon is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aren’t all Dungeons like this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Most Dungeons are 3 floors long. &nbsp;This is abnormal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Normally, if one looked at the Dungeon entrance, one could generally assess the difficulty of a Dungeon. &nbsp;If a level 5 monster appeared on the first floor, the boss’ level was usually level 10 in the beginner’s Dungeon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If there was an extra floor, the boss’ level would be around 15. &nbsp;If the Dungeon was longer than expected, it would usually end on the third floor. &nbsp;The boss’ level would be around level 20. &nbsp;Even if the beginner adventurers were able to break through the Dungeon easily, they would all be killed in the end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But this place...</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Humans…. &nbsp;I will kill everyone, who dares to intrude.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hoo-ahhhhhhhhp!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A level 33 Skeleton was quickly charging towards them. &nbsp;Its eyes were emitting a blue light. &nbsp;Maetel unhesitatingly charged forward to meet the Skeleton. &nbsp;She dodged the Bone Sword way too easily, and she swung a Bone Club acquired from a Skeleton Warrior. &nbsp;It ruthlessly crushed the Skeleton’s skull.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the rear, two Skeleton Archers had been trying to let loose Bone Arrows. &nbsp;Artpe had already taken care of them by throwing Mana infused Bone Daggers towards them. &nbsp;The battle within the 3rd room of the 6th floor ended without any complications.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We are already on the 6th floor, yet there are no signs of this Dungeon ending!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won again! &nbsp;Hoo-hee-hee.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Maetel kept winning, she realized that there was pleasure in triumph. &nbsp;Artpe was sure she hadn’t acted this way in the past, so he wondered what had happened to ruin the trajectory of her growth. &nbsp;Was Artpe really the one to cause this change? &nbsp;In his past life, if the Demon King had seceded his seat to Artpe, he wondered if he would have been able to bring about a victory for the Demon world against the human world. &nbsp;This was how great his brainwashing was!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why is Artpe so good at throwing weapons?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You were able to freely control and wield a blunt weapon when you picked it up. &nbsp;My skills aren’t as great as yours.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Maetel]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Level : 29]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Blunt Weapon Lv4]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe snorted at Maetel’s words as he looted the fallen Skeletons. &nbsp;Maetel was now used to the concept of looting, so she helped Artpe. &nbsp;A silver coin had dropped from one of the monsters. &nbsp;It felt as if it was eons ago(it had been around 4 days) when they had been surprised by the appearance of silver coins. &nbsp;Now the two of them picked it up without being surprised by its presence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It feels almost magical when my level increases. &nbsp;I know I am the same person, yet I am well aware that that I can do much more now! &nbsp;Something I would consider to be miraculous in the past is now part of my daily life. &nbsp;Things that I considered to be impossible are within my reach. &nbsp;This really is quite enjoyable.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Normally, that sensation can be barely achieved only after undergoing countless tribulation. &nbsp;Please keep that in mind.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, Artpe was going through the same process as her, but Artpe had experienced reaching level 350 in his past life. &nbsp;He was able to keep everything in perspective.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel’s talent wasn’t simply better than others, because she had superior strength and status. &nbsp;It had to do with her constitution and level. &nbsp;Moreover, she possessed an instinct that allowed her to adapt in battle situations. &nbsp;She had the potential to bring out the best result from within herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Currently, we are on par with most mercenaries. &nbsp;I’m talking about career mercenaries, who’ve been to war.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you saying, Artpe? &nbsp;We are just 12 years old!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he heard those words, Artpe sharply glared at her as he spoke to Maetel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You should never judge the strength of others based on their appearance or age. &nbsp;This is the first rule of survival.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Y…yes..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Moreover, I don’t want you to blame our weakness on our age. &nbsp;Our enemies won’t go easy on us, because we are young.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, all right…. &nbsp;Artpe is too cool.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You always come to a weird conclusion.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe finished his looting. &nbsp;He checked his equipment, ration and water by habit as he extended his Mana Threads. &nbsp;&nbsp;For the past couple days, he had learned to handle Mana inside a human boy’s body. &nbsp;His use of Mana had come a very long way compared to the first time he manifested his Mana. &nbsp;He hadn’t confirmed this yet, but if he checked in own information, his Mana Control skill should have developed nicely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmmmm?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Something was caught on his Mana Thread. &nbsp;He had been thinking everything was going too smoothly after they had encountered the Elite monster on the 1st floor. &nbsp;It was still a long ways off, but at the end of the 6th floor, Artpe could feel the presence of a monster superior to any monster they had faced up to this point. &nbsp;It was a Skeleton, but it was holding a bastard sword that was most definitely not made out of bones….</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Koo-ohhhhhhhhhhhhh!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>His Mana Thread was severed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Crazy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The monster possessed self-awareness, and it could handle Mana!? &nbsp;After Artpe assessed the situation, he once again sent several dozen threads into his surrounding. &nbsp;At the same time, he grabbed Maetel’s hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Run! &nbsp;Right now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No matter who the enemy is, we should try fighting it first....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is completely different from the Elite Zombie we met earlier! &nbsp;Run!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All right!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two started running in a hurry. &nbsp;They had doubled back, but a Skeleton was approaching them at overwhelming speed. &nbsp;Each room of the Dungeon was separated by a steel door, and the Skeleton was simply busting through them as it gathered the other monsters under its command. &nbsp;It was the worst type of Elite monster! &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you think I’ll go down….so easily!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His Mana Threads had been severed, but he had sent out his Mana Threads once again. &nbsp;This &nbsp;move wasn’t a waste of Mana. &nbsp;Artpe had used the power of his Read All Creation ability, &nbsp;and he used it to activate all the traps with his Mana Threads. &nbsp;The traps got in the way of the Skeletons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Goo-wuhhhhhhhh!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Skeletons were being destroyed at various locations. &nbsp;Even the Elite Skeleton leading the horde was being damaged. &nbsp;Still, the Elite Skeleton hadn’t slowed down much. &nbsp;Instead, it started using the corpses of dead Skeletons to shield itself from the traps.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk…..!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This Dungeon had been annoying in the fact that it had more traps than monsters. &nbsp;However, none of the traps would be able to cause critical damage to the Elite Skeleton. &nbsp;&nbsp;Artpe mainly focused on killing the Skeletons trailing behind the Elite Skeleton with the traps. &nbsp;Artpe and Maetel kept retreating.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where are we running to, Artpe?!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We are going to the Dungeon entrance.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Dungeon entrance? &nbsp;Wait a moment… &nbsp;The Dungeon entrance on the first floor!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel asked as if she wished this wasn’t the case, but Artpe nodded with a stiff expression on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If we don’t get there in time, we are dead.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We can’t win against it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is impossible to win against it through a frontal assault.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if Maetel was an extraordinary genius, she was a hero, who had reached level 29 in less than a week. &nbsp;There was no way she would be able to win against it. &nbsp;Of course, she would lose, since the Elite Skeleton was level 60. &nbsp;The important fact was that it had already crossed the level 50 threshold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In exchange for being able to learn all Skills, we will continues to be heroes until we defeat the Demon King. &nbsp;Aside from the Demon race, all the other races gain a high rank Class when they reach certain levels. &nbsp;It allows one to become more powerful and more specialized. &nbsp;The first time one could earn this high rank Class is at level….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was at level 50. &nbsp;Monsters were no exception. &nbsp;There was a stark difference between &nbsp;monsters that had or hadn’t crossed the level 50 threshold. &nbsp;It wasn’t an exaggeration to say a level 50 monster was 1.5 times stronger than a level 49 monster. &nbsp;The Elite Skeleton had already passed level 50. &nbsp;It had reached level 60! </span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is also equipped with a proper sword and a shield. &nbsp;This means it had gained a Warrior type high rank Class. &nbsp;It possesses the ability to command all the Undeads in this Dungeon. &nbsp;A monster of this caliber could easily dispose any of the normal low rank Dungeon bosses.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The bastard was breaking through the Dungeon at an incredible speed. &nbsp;There weren’t any traps left that Artpe could activate any more. He had been successful in destroying a good amount of normal Skeletons. &nbsp;Still, it would be hard for Artpe to do anything against them anymore. &nbsp;The Elite Skeleton was gradually closing the distance. &nbsp;If things progressed in this fashion, they would have to fight it before they could climb to the 5th floor…..</span></p>
 <p><span style>“....get on, Artpe.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Maetel spoke with a firm voice. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>What did you she want him to do?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He let out a sound that expressed his confusion. &nbsp;However, Maetel didn’t wait for him to give a concrete answer. &nbsp;&nbsp;She put him on her back!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heeng. &nbsp;I wanted this to be the other way around…. Hmmph..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What the hell are you talk…. Ooh-ahhhhhhhh!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Maetel]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Level : 29]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Battle Dash Lv1]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Again!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She once again learned a Skill that transcended her level as if it was nothing…. &nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, it was an exclusive skill for the high rank Class! &nbsp;Artpe didn’t have time to express his dismay. &nbsp;&nbsp;While she gave him a piggyback, Maetel started running through the hallways of the Dungeon at an incredibly fast speed!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hang on tight, Artpe!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even if you hadn’t said anything, I’m already doing that. &nbsp;Shit!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe was being carried on Maetel’s back. &nbsp;It was unsightly, but he knew this was the most effective method. &nbsp;This was why he got comfortable in this position, and he stretched out a hand backwards. &nbsp;At that moment, they were climbing the stairs connecting the 6th and 5th floor. &nbsp;When they were about to reach the 5th floor, he grabbed Matel’s shoulder. &nbsp;He stopped her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait a moment, Maetel.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it, Art…. &nbsp;&nbsp;Kyahhhk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if it was pure Mana, one could physically manifest it if one brought out enough Mana. &nbsp;&nbsp;A thick Mana Iron Mace was formed in Artpe’s hand, and he brought it down against the stairway. &nbsp;The stairway let out a horrific sound as it crumbled!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Artpe is amazing! &nbsp;It will no longer be able to follow us anymore!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, it’ll probably destroy its Skeleton underlings to create a pile until it can reach this floor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Still, it’ll buy us some time, and at the same time, it’ll lessen the enemy’s numbers. &nbsp;Let’s hurry!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They went from the 6th floor to the 5th, 5th to 4th, and 4th to the 3rd floor. &nbsp;It didn’t matter how fast they ran, and it didn’t matter how many stairways they had destroyed. &nbsp;The Skeleton Warrior kept increasing its speed. &nbsp;When they entered the 2nd floor, the Skeleton Warrior could be seen with the naked eye!</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Goo-wuhhhhhhhh!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You should try saying something else, you bone headed dummy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[I’ll kill humans!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It can say other lines!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the second floor, there weren’t any decent traps that could be activated by Artpe. &nbsp;Artpe wondered if should attack the Elite Skeleton by throwing all of his throwing weapons. &nbsp;However, he determined it wasn’t the right moment to use his weapons. &nbsp;Instead, he activated the only magic he could cast.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My will within me. I communicate with the world. &nbsp;Burst on the ground.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Goo-wuhhhhhhhh! &nbsp;Magic is useles…..]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hyper Rubbing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Hmmm!?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if he activated the Hyper Rubbing against his enemies, it would simply make their joints rub against each other. &nbsp;It was a useless attack. &nbsp;However, Artpe had not been aiming for the monsters. &nbsp;He was aiming for the hallway in front of them!</span></p>
 <p><span style>In a flash, the power of Mana started scrubbing hard against the hallway. &nbsp;The hallway shone from being polished. &nbsp;Maetel was impressed by this sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow. &nbsp;Now that we have this magic, we don’t have to worry about cleaning!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ll never have to clean in your life.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, no! &nbsp;We have to split the housework in a fair manner. &nbsp;I can’t make Artpe do all the hard work!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fact that she was able to spout such nonsense meant that Maetel’s condition was still ok! &nbsp;He was able to check the mental state of Maetel in an odd way. &nbsp;Afterwards, he checked on the monsters, who had been chasing them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The very first monster he checked was the Elite Skeleton Warrior. &nbsp;It had been running in front of the mob. &nbsp;It knew that Artpe’s magic couldn’t directly damage its body, so it had unhesitatingly took a step forward. &nbsp;The Skeleton was like a dog on ice. &nbsp;It slid all over the place before it fell to the floor.!</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Kill humans, ahhhhhhhhhh!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had used a powerful Shouting skill, but it failed to damage the hero’s party. &nbsp;Instead, the normal Skeletons, who had been running behind the Elite Skeleton, started sliding on the floor towards the Elite Skeleton. &nbsp;The normal Skeletons delivered power body blows to the Elite Skeleton.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Gwuhhhhhhhhh!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Gee-gee-gee-gee-gee-gee]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[My precious C3 cervical vertebrae…..!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe let out a shout of delight. &nbsp;While he was casting his magic, he hadn’t been sure if his plan would work. &nbsp;Artpe had used the Hyper Rubbing spell on the earthen floor. &nbsp;The magic worked furiously as it made the ground slicker than an oiled steel plate. &nbsp;When the monsters stepped on the floor, the monsters had all fallen to the floor in order.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe had used magical energy to influence the physical world. &nbsp;He had completely changed the terrain. &nbsp;Even if his enemy had the power to resist against the Mana, it couldn’t avoid this debacle.</span></p>
