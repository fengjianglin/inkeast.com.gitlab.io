 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Originally, it was a skill that allowed her to share spells and abilities with Artpe. &nbsp;However, she had brought along Sienna’s ability too. &nbsp;Something incomprehensible had happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Artpe didn’t ask how this was possible. &nbsp;He used that time to think about how to kill the Kraken using this new factor. &nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If the Hellfire Sentinel was intact, it would have been impossible. &nbsp;However, it had broken apart completely, and each fragments were basically akin to a high rank consumable artifact. &nbsp;This was why it was possible for him to pull this off. &nbsp;He would have to consume a massive amount of Mana, but Artpe would be able to pull it off by squeezing out every ounce of Mana from within his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Reinforcement.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“When I made the resolve to retreat, I never expected to be pushed back into another risky venture like this…….”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Until now, he had recklessly tried to do everything by himself. &nbsp;When he found himself unable to succeed, he had labeled himself as a ‘fake hero’. &nbsp;He did as he pleased, and his thoughts were like a self-fulfilling prophecy. &nbsp;He had been ready to run away. &nbsp;Artpe had been under a misconception. &nbsp;Even in his past life, the hero had never tried to accomplish tasks by herself!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had always had companions by her side. &nbsp;In his past life, Artpe couldn’t understand the reasoning behind it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One plus one was always equaled two. &nbsp;Usually, conflict occurred when you put people together. &nbsp;There was a far greater chance of encountering a Dragon than to find people one was able to work synergistically with. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a Demon, Artpe took no heed of others. &nbsp;He considered them to be hindrances, and he considered it fortunate if he wasn’t hurt by them. &nbsp;It wasn’t as if he liked being by himself. &nbsp;However, the situation, the era and the state of his mind at the time made him fly solo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was why he couldn’t completely discard his old habit even after his reincarnation. &nbsp;He was with Maetel and Sienna now. &nbsp;However, he had assessed their abilities, and he had put them in separate categories. &nbsp;He had acted as if he was being rational, and he had done everything his own way. &nbsp;This was why he had only thought about sending away Maetel and Sienna from the front line. &nbsp;He had considered their roles to be done.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, that wasn’t true. &nbsp;Heroes had the ability to make the impossible possible. &nbsp;They made things that shouldn’t exist together to be able to coexist with each other. &nbsp;The proof was right in front of him right now. &nbsp;Sienna’s magical energy was being absorbed and amplified within the Demite’s Gemstone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sienna’s magical energy was being transferred through Maetel, and it was manifesting from Artpe’s hands.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Heh heh. &nbsp;I didn’t think it would work. &nbsp;However, when I tried really hard, it worked.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How can you come here with such a mentality? You really are the worst.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Go.”</span></p>
