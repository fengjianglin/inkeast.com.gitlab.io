 <p>Chapter 41 - Hero VS Kingdom (3)</p>
 <p><span style>He had a dream.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a land of despair where everything was dyed with blood and darkness. &nbsp;He stood face to face with her on top of a castle wall made through the pain and suffering of people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No, it was a too one-sided encounter to call it a face to face meeting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe had already lost to the hero. &nbsp;All his magic spells had been blocked by their magician. &nbsp;He had thrown his daggers in desperation, but an archer with long ears destroyed all of them with her sharp arrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Normally, his subordinates were lazy, and they had treated his authority as their commanding general as shit. &nbsp;However, they acted in a way that was incongruous to their past actions. &nbsp;His subordinates fought desperately to protect him, but in the end, they were easily slain by the warrior’s great sword. &nbsp;If they had always done well as they did right now, their actions wouldn’t have felt sudden and unexpected to Artpe. &nbsp;They decided to act in such a way at the last moment, and it almost brought tears to Artpe’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t do it. &nbsp;Wait a moment. &nbsp;Don’t swing that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hero······.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The steel knight, who never took off his helmet, refused to stop. &nbsp;He was about to sever Artpe’s head. &nbsp;However, the hero desperately halted his action.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All the other members inside the hero’s party let out a sigh at the same time. &nbsp;The hero paid no attention to them as she stepped forward. &nbsp;She made a sincere entreaty towards Artpe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><span style>Please don’t cause any trouble, and surrender to us, Four Heavenly King Artpe Hirtana Kelduke. &nbsp;There is no need for us to fight each other any longer.</span><span style>”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hero! &nbsp;You!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is impossible.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everyone be quiet······ &nbsp;Please surrender yourself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe hadn’t been hostile towards the hero from the beginning. &nbsp;She was the only one that was aware of this fact. &nbsp;Artpe had watched over the hero for a very long time, and she was aware of this fact too. &nbsp;If Artpe had wanted to, the hero knew he could have killed her a long time ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was why they could be on the same side. &nbsp;She was sure they could be on the same side. &nbsp;They…..</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You speak as if the Demon King’s army isn’t on a campaign to bring peace to the world.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Artpe made light of the hero’s words as he mocked her. &nbsp;His sharp purple eyes were half hidden by his drooping black hair. &nbsp;It wasn't just the hero. &nbsp;His eyes twinkled as if he was mocking the entire hero’s party.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why······?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She asked the question as if she couldn’t understand him. &nbsp;However, Artpe didn’t give her an answer. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t want to stop the hero’s steps. &nbsp;A heavy burden was already on her slender shoulders, and he didn’t want to add more to her burden.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Instead, he tried to relax her contorted face a little bit. &nbsp;He let out a grin as he opened his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><span style>“Hero. I’m pretty sure a very good looking noonim will be coming here soon, and she’ll be very angry when she sees my corpse. &nbsp;I want you to give her this message</span><span style>.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His words were very comedic when one considered it to be his last words. &nbsp;It made the hero’s face scrunch up. &nbsp;Unlike her, the members of the hero’s party thought Artpe was scheming to screw over the hero. &nbsp;This was why they started moving before Artpe could finish his skit. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Warrior unsheathed and gripped his great sword. &nbsp;The magician held a staff that looked too heavy for her even if she was holding it with both hands. &nbsp;She prepared a spell. &nbsp;The archer pointed an arrow towards Artpe. &nbsp;The red haired thief rushed towards Artpe with his daggers drawn. </span></p>
 <p><span style>They all treasured the hero above all else. &nbsp;They wanted to shield her from the fucked up truths that dominated the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t try to confuse her, Four Heavenly King.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In truth, I…. &nbsp;Kuh-huhk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dagger scored a clean hit. &nbsp;Artpe had already exhausted his magical energy, and his defensive gear were all broken. &nbsp;His consumable artifacts were all used up. &nbsp;Artpe could no longer put up a fight, so he exposed his heart to the dagger of the thief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes, he already knew this would happen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In truth, I’m not too fond of older women… &nbsp;Kahk. &nbsp;Please tell her…!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His vision was being dyed black. &nbsp;He could feel Etna’s Mana swell from afar. &nbsp;She was the commander of the Army of Thieves. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Ah, if I was going to die anyways, I shouldn’t have called noo-nim here.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had such useless thoughts as he died.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><span style>This makes you… &nbsp;It makes you seem like a normal person….!</span><span style>”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He could hear the tearful voice of the hero as he was at death’s door. &nbsp;Her voice somehow made his chest burn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he couldn’t turn back the time. &nbsp;This was a story that had already ended.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was how his previous life came to an end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe’s Innate ability had reversed the world, and he opened his eyes from within a small human body. &nbsp;&nbsp;He wanted to hurry up and wake up from the nightmare that rehashed the past events…...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No······ Nooooooooooooooooo!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He heard a female’s scream. &nbsp;It was the voice that he had heard during the last moments of his previous life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wait a moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Who’s voice of despair was it······?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“······ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe opened his eyes. &nbsp;His ears were deafened by the sound. &nbsp;It was the worst kind of nightmare.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had a harsh expression on his face as he tried to get up. &nbsp;However, his body was strangely heavy, so he looked down. &nbsp;Maetel and Sienna had fallen asleep from exhaustion after they had a territorial fight over his abdomen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked to the side, and he saw Aena who had gotten up early. &nbsp;She glared at him with white eyes. &nbsp;She was looking at him as if he was a convicted criminal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“······well, I’m popular. &nbsp;What can I do about it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmph!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Aena’s cheeks were puffed out as she quickly turned her head away. &nbsp;Artpe let out a bitter laugh when he saw her. &nbsp;Then he woke up the two brats that clung to him like koalas. &nbsp;It was time to head out now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the morning brightened, the townspeople and the children were led out the town by Artpe and Maetel. &nbsp;Since all of them had packs on their backs, it looked as if they were refugees. Fortunately, it was late spring, so the weather was mild.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm. &nbsp;We are quite noticeable. &nbsp;That’s great..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t it bad if we are noticed, Artpe?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel tilted her head in puzzlement as she asked the question. &nbsp;Artpe let out a light laugh as he gave an explanation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That only applies when we are exploring a Dungeon where we have no idea if strong enemies are present or not. &nbsp;However, we know that there are only level 100 cast offs inside this region. &nbsp;This is why it would be more convenient if they scouted and came towards us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When their enemies caught sight of the group, they would immediately attack the party. &nbsp;In such a scenario, Maetel would be able to cut them down without being repulsed by what she had to do.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe didn’t explain any further as he expanded his Mana Threads into a wide net. &nbsp;This wasn’t something like feeling an ominous feeling when one was being watched or ambushed. &nbsp;He would be able to know who was going to attack him. &nbsp;At the very least, it would allow him to prepare a counterattack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he controlled a massive amount of Mana, he directed a question towards the nearby Village Person A.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So which village is closest to this location?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The village doesn’t have an official name…. &nbsp;&nbsp;If we go past that hill, we’ll be there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The town didn’t have a name. &nbsp;These towns were so unimportant that it would probably not be recorded in the hero’s chronicle. &nbsp;They went to several of these villages as they gathered more people. &nbsp;Moreover, they cleared out all the soldiers and black magicians they encountered….</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Quest Reward would continue to bottom out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The thought of it made him sad. &nbsp;However, even if the Quest Reward was garbage now, he had to go through it to get to the next stage of this Quest. &nbsp;This was the charm of a chained Quest, so he had to endure it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Still, I hope this ends before the summer of this year. &nbsp;I want to avoid what always occurs in the fall…...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he went by the schedule, they had plenty of time. &nbsp;They would have enough time even if they ran in place going nowhere for four years. &nbsp;Even if such delays occurred, Maetel would probably learn skills like Jump and all the techniques associated with it. &nbsp;She was scary like that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The problem right now was the fact that the world and the monsters changed depending on the seasons. &nbsp;There were monsters that were calm in the spring, and they would cause trouble in the summer. &nbsp;Then there were the monsters that attacked after the fall harvest in the winter. &nbsp;They attacked to steal the food of the humans. &nbsp;Artpe was trying to proceed on a specific route, and there were those on this route that would be affected by the seasons..</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If Silpennon is able to grow up quickly, I can use him. &nbsp;No, it might be faster to develop this one. ’</span></p>
 <p><span style>On one side of him, a lovely white-haired girl was grabbing onto his sleeve like Maetel. &nbsp;He smirked as he looked down at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was skilled enough to control her Mana, and under his tutelage, she was emitting a white colored Mana. &nbsp;She was moving it around with one hand. &nbsp;Her skill level was better than him in his previous life. &nbsp;She had ridiculous amount of potential. &nbsp;Why were there only geniuses around him!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The genius pouted as she looked up at Artpe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is tiring, oppa.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mana is nature. &nbsp;If you accept nature as being Mana, nature will soon become one with your Mana. &nbsp;It will fill you up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ok. &nbsp;I’ll try harder.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Demons possessed overwhelming more Mana compared to humans. &nbsp;After consuming Mana, Demons also had a much faster recovery time. &nbsp;The reason for this difference was the fact that the Demon race looked at Mana in a fundamentally different way than humans.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter how much he explained it, humans were unable to understand the perspective seen by the Demon race. &nbsp;There were magicians in historical records that were barely able to understand this truth after many years. &nbsp;This foundation allowed them to be able to compete against Demons. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>In his past life, the magician from the hero’s party understood this perspective. &nbsp;It was thanks to this magician that the Demon race’s strongholds in the human world was all brought down. &nbsp;Any Demon that got in her way had died. &nbsp;In truth, Artpe was more afraid of the magician than the hero in his previous life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah. &nbsp;It quickened a little bit. &nbsp;Oppa, it is as if the Mana is smiling at me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“······yes, I see. &nbsp;So that’s how it is.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In this life, it seemed there would be at least one more terrifying prodigy that would be on par with that magician.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe wonder why such a monster-like prodigy like Sienna hadn’t made a name for herself in his previous life. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>He stroked the head of the girl that was smiling brightly at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ughhhh, Artpe. &nbsp;I....I want to learn Mana…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Maetel, you are already pretty good at handling Mana…...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In short order, they arrived at the first town. &nbsp;The town had been in a rut, since they had lost all their children. &nbsp;They rejoiced when they saw the safely returned children. &nbsp;They also cried for the children that would never make it back to them. &nbsp;Then they became shocked at Artpe’s edict to leave their town.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I….I can’t do this!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, you saved my child, so I’ll give you compensation as thanks. &nbsp;However, I can’t abandon the village…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We won’t force you to do this. &nbsp;However, if you all continue to live like this, the soldiers will steal your children once again. &nbsp;Shall I give you more bad news? &nbsp;They won’t hesitate to torture you for information regarding my party. &nbsp;They will kill several of you as an example.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“O...our king would never······.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is a different king on the throne.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W...what!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The people discussed the topic in a heated fashion, and sides were formed. &nbsp;The people that lost then recovered their children followed Artpe and Maetel’s lead. &nbsp;The rest stayed behind. &nbsp;Since the children obediently followed Artpe and Maetel, the townspeople decided to put their trust in them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If the soldiers come asking questions, you guys tell them everything you saw here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I...if we do that, magician-nim will….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s all right. &nbsp;You tell them everything. &nbsp;You can even tell me what I’m trying to accomplish. &nbsp;It is better than you guys dying just because you hid the information.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Magician-nim······!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The people remaining behind in the town had rejected Artpe, yet he was being considerate towards them!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, he didn’t think the soldiers would let the townspeople live even if the townspeople told them everything. &nbsp;However, Artpe had given them a fighting chance. &nbsp;He had done enough for these idiots who had basically forfeited their lives, because they were afraid of change.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It took several days, but Artpe’s party toured all the nearby villages. &nbsp;Most towns reacted similarly to each other, and the people who lost their children showed strong feelings towards Artpe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My child! &nbsp;What happened to my child!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You did it! &nbsp;I bet you killed my child!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe understood their rage, so he didn’t get mad. &nbsp;Maetel had been restless over the situation, and she had done well holding herself back until now. &nbsp;However, her composure broke when she met the parents of the dead children.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, it isn’t like that. &nbsp;When we found the children, they were already…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s enough, Maetel.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were unfairly placing the blame on Artpe. &nbsp;Maetel had emerged from this tragedy alongside him, so it would have been weird if Maetel wasn’t agitated by the current situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the truth would place the people in more danger. &nbsp;If townspeople decided to stay behind, they were told the children were kidnapped, and some had died under unfortunate circumstances.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He left it at that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was too late to save them. &nbsp;I’m very sorry. &nbsp;I have no excuses.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe spoke only those words. Deception and disdain were necessary skills for the Four Heavenly King, but he briefly put away those skills. &nbsp;Right now he had to use an essential skill used by swindlers. &nbsp;He pushed forward with his version of the story. &nbsp;There were omissions, so he wasn’t technically lying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was enough.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eek. &nbsp;Eeeeek…...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Koo-hoohk….. &nbsp;We already know you aren’t at fault. &nbsp;However, if we accept that as fact then who should we hate!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hoohk······ &nbsp;My baby…. My baby…..!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, many people rejected Artpe’s offer. &nbsp;He was a being that possessed mysterious powers, and that fact was enough for to be ostracised by them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, the people who accepted his help stuck very close to him. &nbsp;Artpe had to be satisfied with that fact.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, Maetel’s heart hurt as she took in everything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Artpe.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No one here is at fault, Maetel. &nbsp;The people who are dishing out the hate and the people who are receiving the hate aren’t at fault. &nbsp;Sometimes screwed up situations like this occurs. &nbsp;In truth, this is some of what happens in real life.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The war in his previous life was similar. &nbsp;Even if the Demons didn’t want to fight, they had no choice thanks to the Innate ability of the Demon King. &nbsp;A kindhearted girl had to repeatedly fight horrific battles just because fate had chosen her to be the hero.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What happened in her past life was about to be repeated in her present life. &nbsp;He had no other words he could say except that it was screwed up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ooh-ooooo. &nbsp;All right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel understood the meaning behind his words, so she suppressed her emotions. &nbsp;This in turn increased the frequency of her sneaking into his arms when he slept. &nbsp;Sienna unnecessarily burned with a strong sense of rivalry, so she stuck close to Artpe too. &nbsp;It just made Artpe exhausted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were a lot of words and troubles exchanged, but all the people were gathered in a week. &nbsp;There were around 2,000 people gathered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It took them an additional two days to search for a land that would be suitable for them to live on. &nbsp;They ended up at the mid-slope of a hill where monsters rarely appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So are we supposed to build the town here, magician-nim? &nbsp;No, I guess we have to call it a small city.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are two thousand people here. &nbsp;I wonder if this many people can really live here…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll help you build your city. &nbsp;Don’t worry too much about it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A large number of people came here, because they looked up toward Artpe and Maetel. &nbsp;It looked as if Artpe felt a bit abashed when he scratched his nose as he spoke. &nbsp;However, his inner thought differed a little bit from his outward appearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Since I’ve made a bait this large, a large fish should be biting it soon.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was how the city construction started.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fish became aware of this without delay. &nbsp;</span></p>
