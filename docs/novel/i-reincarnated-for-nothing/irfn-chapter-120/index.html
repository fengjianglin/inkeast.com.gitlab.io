 <p>Chapter 120 - Double Crisis (1)</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Artpe!?”</p>
 <p>“Artpe-nim!”</p>
 <p>If one was awake, one wouldn’t be able to ignore the chaos that was sweeping through the entire city. &nbsp;It was that chaotic. &nbsp;The holy priestess and the hero had been immersed in a war that could only be waged between women. &nbsp;However, they saw the images outside, and they heard the voices accompanying the footage. &nbsp;They immediately stood up, and they ran out of the room. &nbsp;Their eyes turned round when they discovered Artpe outside of the room.</p>
 <p>“Artpe-nim, do you know what is happening right now!?”</p>
 <p>“I have a rough idea, but I don’t have time to explain it to you…. &nbsp;Just follow me!”</p>
 <p>Silpennon had shown him his map today, and there was only one region that hadn’t been explored completely. &nbsp;Artpe was successful in narrowing down the location that would be most suitable for what was going on right now. &nbsp;Artpe took the two girls, and he abruptly started running.</p>
 <p>“Aht! &nbsp;Holy priestess-nim-kahk!”</p>
 <p>A priest had caught sight of them, and he started running towards them. &nbsp;The priest’s head was sent flying when Artpe swung his Mana String.</p>
 <p>“Act now, ask questions later.”</p>
 <p>“Artpe-nim!?”</p>
 <p>“It’s all right. &nbsp;I won’t kill anyone that doesn’t possess Demonic energy.”</p>
 <p>“Demonic energy…. &nbsp; As expected, hero-nim…..!”</p>
 <p>“I'll tell you everything later. &nbsp;We have to move right now.”</p>
 <p>Artpe let out a light laughter as he tossed the corpse into his Dimensional Pouch. &nbsp;Vadinet was at a loss for words when she saw this.</p>
 <p>Artpe seemed to know everything that was going on inside the temple. &nbsp;However, that fact was secondary to what he was showing her. &nbsp;Until now, Vadinet had strictly known him to be a magician, yet he was showing her feats that was unimaginable. &nbsp;It ran counter to what he had shown everyone on the surface.</p>
 <p>“Let’s hurry before more priests gather here. &nbsp;We have to save our friends.”</p>
 <p>“Who’s Aria? &nbsp;Who is that girl? &nbsp;How come she is taking on the main role of a misfortunate heroine?”</p>
 <p>“She is Silpennon’s ally. &nbsp;She also possess an Innate ability, and her magical energy beyond her Record. &nbsp;She is the ideal candidate to use as a sacrifice for a spell.”</p>
 <p>Artpe grinded his teeth as he spoke. &nbsp;They were very unlucky. &nbsp;If Silpennon and Aria weren’t discovered by the pope, he would have be able to leisurely move the pieces on the board to his liking….&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At least, Silpennon was able to activate the Artifact, and he was able to expose the true identity of their opponent with truly exquisite timing. &nbsp;Fortunately, their true identity was being spread across the city. &nbsp;Artpe was within the Zero Class, yet he could feel the city become red hot. &nbsp;He could feel the anger, shock and suspicion of the people. &nbsp;He could vividly hear the shouts coming from them.</p>
 <p>“The masquerade is at an end. &nbsp;Even if we resolve this as soon as possible, it will take a very long time for this city’s faith to recover…..”</p>
 <p>“It seems Artpe-nim had made preparations for all of this. &nbsp;While you laughed and conversed with me, you ordered your underlings to expose the dark underbelly of the temple to the whole world….. &nbsp;I cannot begin to fathom the new Artifact and the type of magic being used right now.”</p>
 <p>“Hue hue. &nbsp;Isn’t Artpe too cool?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, he really is…. &nbsp; He is too amazing.”</p>
 <p>It wasn’t as if friendship blossomed after their fight. &nbsp;The two women were showing off their affections for Artpe, and in the end, they had made a connection.</p>
 <p>Artpe started not liking the idea of being connected to these women. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>No. &nbsp;Didn’t he have hope yet?</p>
 <p>Silpennon will encounter Vadinet at the site, and she’ll miraculously awaken to her true love towards Silpennon…. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Was he expecting too much?</p>
 <p>“Koohk!? &nbsp;Hero-nim······.”</p>
 <p>“Ok. &nbsp;Bye!”</p>
 <p>There were two types of priests that were running around the Zero Class. &nbsp;There were the priests that were a bit slow in the head. &nbsp;These priests still didn’t know what was going on. &nbsp;Then there were the priests, who were jittery. &nbsp;They were anxious at the prospect of being found out.</p>
 <p>The former group would never cross paths with Artpe’s party. &nbsp;The latter group was immediately killed when encountered. &nbsp;Roa growled every time a priest was killed, but he wouldn’t let her drain the Demonc energy from the dead bodies.</p>
 <p>“Later. &nbsp;I’m pretty sure a more appetizing prey will show up soon.”</p>
 <p>[Nyaa-ahhhhhhh.]</p>
 <p>Maetel had a good idea as to who that prey was. &nbsp;Maetel steadily went into her battle mode as she confirmed something with Artpe.</p>
 <p>“Artpe, what level is the pope?”</p>
 <p>“He’s around 340.”</p>
 <p>“340!?”</p>
 <p>“For your information, he is also one of the Four Heavenly King in the Demon king’s army.”</p>
 <p>Maetel and Vadinet felt like they had turned stupid when he dropped this enormous bombshell. &nbsp; He smirked as he continued to speak.</p>
 <p>“The Demon King’s army always enjoys hitting humanity on the back of the head. &nbsp;By taking the temple, the hero will despair even if they aren’t able to kill the hero. &nbsp;That is the way of the Demon King’s army.”</p>
 <p>Moreover, there were two heroes this time around. &nbsp;This was also the reason why they were insistent on killing one of the heroes. &nbsp;This plan was the height of inefficiency, so it definitely had the touch of the Chef’s hands!</p>
 <p>Moreover, the one overseeing this whole plan was…..</p>
 <p>“His name is Jeriet, and he possesses an Innate ability of Transformation. &nbsp;He is….. &nbsp; He is the weakest amongst the Four Heavenly Kings.”</p>
 <p>In his past life, Jeriet had been one seat above Artpe in the Demon King’s army. &nbsp;It was fair to assume that he was probably the weakest now.</p>
 <p>He was like Artpe. &nbsp;His abilities weren’t focused solely on the martial aspects. &nbsp;If the hero’s party had to fight a higher level opponent, he was probably the most fair opponent.</p>
 <p>“I sense something was wrong with the pope, but I never expected him to be a Demon…..”</p>
 <p>“That bastard eats his chosen prey. &nbsp;The consumption of his preys allows him to duplicate all the special characteristics of his preys. &nbsp;He is able to transform into their form. &nbsp;At some point, he took the place of the real pope.”</p>
 <p>“My god…..”</p>
 <p>She knew their current situation was urgent, but Vadinet couldn’t help it. &nbsp;She asked another question.</p>
 <p>“How do you know all of this, Artpe-nim!?”</p>
 <p>“It is the nature of my Innate ability. &nbsp;You cannot hide anything from my eyes. &nbsp;Like right now….”</p>
 <p>Several Mana Strings extended from his hand, and the strands swiped at empty air.</p>
 <p>In the next moment, a part of the hallway naturally crumbled, and a staircase leading downward was revealed.</p>
 <p>“My god….. &nbsp; Your powers really gives me the chills. &nbsp;As expected of hero-nim….!”</p>
 <p>“So, Artpe….”</p>
 <p>Vadinet’s eyes were full of love and admiration. &nbsp;On the other hand, Maetel was somewhat used to his abilities, so she unsheathed her sword as she asked him a question.</p>
 <p>“Is there a way we can win against a level 340 enemy? &nbsp;We were able to win against the Kraken and the Ancient Kraken thanks to extremely favorable circumstances. &nbsp;The current situation…..”</p>
 <p>“It really is the perfect situation for us. &nbsp;You don’t know this yet, but there is a reason why Demons don’t directly confront a hero in the human realm.”</p>
 <p>“Huh?”</p>
 <p>Maetel tilted her head in confusion, but Artpe wasn’t the one to explain the situation. &nbsp;The explanation was given by none other than the holy priestess.</p>
 <p>“A Demon’s ability is weakened in the human realm. &nbsp;There is also a difference in Mana depending on the realm. &nbsp;Demons are weakened up to a certain point here, and they aren’t able to manifest their power given to them by their level.”</p>
 <p>She continued to speak as the party descended the staircase.</p>
 <p>“I’m embarrassed to say this, but…... &nbsp;It is possible to weaken them further with the power I possess. &nbsp;It is the significance of being a holy priestess.”</p>
 <p>“As their first act, this was why the Demon King’s army decided to render the temple powerless. &nbsp;It is also why one of the Four Heavenly King transformed into the pope to infiltrate this place. &nbsp;He did it despite knowing the danger.”</p>
 <p>In truth, the plan had been very successful in his previous life. &nbsp;A Four Heavenly King died in that venture, but he had expertly razed the temple to the ground. &nbsp;The holy priestess’ tragic end was just a bonus.</p>
 <p>“However, even if I’m capable of weakening them, I’m merely a holy priestess with no battle capabilities. &nbsp;That is why I acted ignorant until Artpe-nim arrived. &nbsp;I had no choice.”</p>
 <p>“The fact that you became aware of their intentions is amazing in itself. &nbsp;Even a normal hero won’t be able to see through that bastard’s transformation ability.”</p>
 <p>Unfortunately for their enemies, Artpe and Maetel weren’t normal heroes. &nbsp;It was as if they were heroes that had experienced killing a Demon King before. &nbsp;On the other hand, Vadinet was only a holy priestess. &nbsp;It was quite the feat that she was able to notice the seditious energy crawling through the inner temple.</p>
 <p>“I guess we are just going to rush him. &nbsp;He is level 340, but he is weakened since he is in the human realm. &nbsp;If this woman casts an additional weakening spell….. &nbsp;Yes, I think it’ll be possible.”</p>
 <p>“However, the biggest variable that could sway the outcome of this situation is the magic circle.”</p>
 <p>She had used the magic circle in her past life to transmogrify herself into a Demon. &nbsp;As expected, the holy priestess made an astute observation.</p>
 <p>“You said the Demon has a transformation ability, and he ate the pope. &nbsp;In turn, this gives him everything possessed by the pope, so he probably gained the ability to use the magic circle…. &nbsp; However, it doesn’t seem he was able to activate 100% of its power. &nbsp;Anyways, there is a high probability that he’ll use the magic circle to amplify his power.”</p>
 <p>“No. &nbsp;If he did that, he’ll be tied to the magic circle. &nbsp;He isn’t just aiming for Silpennon and Aria. &nbsp;He wants to eliminate either Maetel or me. &nbsp;Instead of amplifying his power, there is a high chance that he’ll use it for a summoning magic.”</p>
 <p>“Summon magic…. &nbsp;I see. &nbsp;I didn’t realize there was that possibility…..”</p>
 <p>In truth, similar words were written inside the exchange diary found within the Zero Class by Silpennon and Aria.</p>
 <p>At the time, it said they wanted to summon a level 250 magical beast. &nbsp;However, they had a sacrifice now, so they would probably attempt to bring out a much higher level magical beast. &nbsp;It might not be a one-off. &nbsp;They might attempt multiple summons. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>The price of this magic was Aria…..&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Artpe bit his lips.</p>
 <p>“She said she wanted an active role, but she keeps acting like a heroine in a knight’s tale.”</p>
 <p>“Artpe…. &nbsp;That girl too….?”</p>
 <p>“No, she isn’t mine. &nbsp;She’s with Silpennon.”</p>
 <p>After descending the staircase, they ran through a dark hallway. &nbsp;The voice and the image being projected above the city no longer reached them. &nbsp;However, one thing was for sure. &nbsp;Aria’s situation would not get better. &nbsp;In fact, her situation was turning graver by the minute. &nbsp;Even if one factored in the fact that the Four Heavenly King Jeriet was weakened, Silpennon hadn’t reached level 220 yet. &nbsp;Jeriet wasn’t a foe that could be overcome by Silpennon.</p>
 <p>‘If he is like the one I knew, he’ll act big. &nbsp;He’ll try to show off. &nbsp;He’ll give the hero’s party the time to make preparations. &nbsp;He’s supposed to be the prototypical Four Heavenly King of the Demon King’s army…. &nbsp;If he finds out about the footage that is being sent out through Silpennon’s magical tool, the situation will get worse. &nbsp;Then Silpennon will try to save Aria even if it is unreasonable for him to do so. &nbsp;He might get hurt….. &nbsp;Shit!’</p>
 <p>That was why it would have been better if they weren’t found out in the first place!</p>
 <p>If so, the reformed holy priestess would have worked with the two heroes to gratifyingly fuck over the pope and his core allies. &nbsp;Artpe would have been able to induce a classic scenario. &nbsp;However, he was about to lose two precious talents if things continued along this path! &nbsp;On top of that, the temple was going to be destroyed in its entirety!</p>
 <p>“Artpe! &nbsp;Over there!”</p>
 <p>“Kill them all!”</p>
 <p>“Understood!”</p>
 <p>The secret hallways reached all corners of the Zero Class. &nbsp;The priests, who had thrown away their god to worship the Demonic god, were using the secret hallways to converge on the magic circle!</p>
 <p>Artpe and Maetel were merciless as they cut down anyone in their path. &nbsp;Vadinet was very flustered as she watched them. &nbsp;Then she finally realized she could do something to help them.</p>
 <p>“O...oh, my god! &nbsp;The heroes are fighting against evil as you’ve ordered. Please imbue them with power suitable for this situation! &nbsp;Hero Bless!”</p>
 <p>This was something only a holy priestess could use on a hero. &nbsp;It was a buff spell. &nbsp;This was obvious, but this was the first time Artpe and Maetel had received it.</p>
 <p>There wasn’t a clear amplification of their power, but it felt as if their bodies were light as feather. &nbsp;The feeling was temporary, but it felt as if they had leveled up multiple times at once.</p>
 <p>“It is a buff that increases the quality of your soul! &nbsp;I thought it might be something that both of you must have when facing an opponent with a higher level…..”</p>
 <p>“Ah, yes. &nbsp;This is the first time I’ve received a buff. &nbsp;It’s something new.”</p>
 <p>Fortunately, this blessing wasn’t headed only towards Artpe. &nbsp;It would have been a lie if he said he hadn’t been worried. &nbsp;However, even Vadinet was able to discern what was most important right now.</p>
 <p>When Artpe saw this, he carelessly smiled towards Vadient. &nbsp;At his gaze, Vadinet felt embarrassment and happiness. &nbsp;She lowered her head.</p>
 <p>‘Does Artpe-nim know about what I did back then…..? Ah. &nbsp;Ah-ooh-ooh. &nbsp;Artpe-nim is so advanced in the path of magic that he might have noticed it. &nbsp;I see. &nbsp;He acted completely innocent during the Blessing….. &nbsp;I can’t believe how truly great he is.’</p>
 <p>It didn’t matter what Artpe did. &nbsp;In the end, she felt herself liking him more. &nbsp;Her feelings surged. &nbsp;In that aspect, she was similar to Maetel. &nbsp;Artpe, who was unaware of her feelings, just continued to move forward.</p>
 <p>After several more priests(There were only 20 priests residing within the Zero Class. &nbsp;They had killed a lot of them.) were killed, they were finally able to reach the scene.</p>
 <p>“Silpennon, are you somehow holding out….. &nbsp; Huh?”</p>
 <p>He was ready to overturn everything as he poured his magic into his Magic String. &nbsp;He forcefully kicked the door open, and he saw the underground square. &nbsp;Artpe was having a hard time believing his eyes.</p>
 <p>He didn’t want it to happen, but he had been ready for the worst case scenario of Aria being sacrificed. &nbsp;He had been prepared to face a level 300 three-headed monster······.</p>
 <p>“Aria!”</p>
 <p>“Ooht. &nbsp;Ooh-ahhhhhhhh!”</p>
 <p>“Koohk. &nbsp;Y...you bitch!”</p>
 <p>The center of the magic circle was still letting out an uncontrollable amount of light.</p>
 <p>However, the magic wasn’t completed for the duration. &nbsp;The Mana of the magic circle was pouring into the sacrifice, who had been placed in the middle of the magic circle.</p>
 <p>“What the······?”</p>
 <p>Artpe rubbed at his eyes as he looked at the scene again. &nbsp;He used his Read All ability, but the information he received wasn’t different from what he already knew.</p>
 <p>Aria was using her Innate ability.</p>
 <p>She was assimilating with the magic circle.</p>
