 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At some point, the Demons that were carrying out the Demonification research in the human realm had disappeared. &nbsp;The reason behind this was simple. &nbsp;When Artpe killed Jeriet, the Seros company had atrophied. &nbsp;Most of Jeriet’s project had been intertwined with the business of the Seros company, so all their plans had come to a halt</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the time, the Four Heavenly King and the powerful Demons, who had been following the orders of the previous Demon King, were having a hard time exiting the Demon realm. &nbsp;Amongst the Demons that were already present in the human realm, none were as strong as Jeriet. &nbsp;This was why the Seros merchant company had lost their clout.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a result, a stalemate occurred. &nbsp;This was why the Demons were hiding in the secret headquarters of the Seros company.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“At first, we didn’t know what was happening. &nbsp;We were barely able to see their plan when the previous Demon King’s forces came to the fore. &nbsp;This isn’t the current Demon King’s style.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What style of action does the current Demon King prefer?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Instead of working behind the scenes, he likes to grow his power out in the open. &nbsp;He likes to cause fear through an overt display of power.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If one went only by her words, it was as if she was describing a chimpanzee instead of a Demon King. &nbsp;Their current situation didn’t allow them to joke around, so Vadinet decided to keep her mouth shut.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The one that was the most excited was Roa.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nyaa-ah, nyaa-nyaa-ah. &nbsp;Nyaa nyaa nyaa nyaa nyaa.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was never in doubt that she was a cat. &nbsp;Her steps were light, soft and quick. &nbsp;She sucked in all the Demonic energy that permeated these grounds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The current Roa was nothing like the past Roa. &nbsp;She was quick and precise in picking out only the Demonic energy. &nbsp;The Demons didn’t even have the chance to use their magic. &nbsp;They fell to the floor before they could even move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Roa, don’t let even one of them leave this place.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I already know, nyaa-ah.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Etna didn’t personally subdue the Demons. &nbsp;She just used her vast magical energy to cover the entire headquarters with a massive heat barrier. &nbsp;Nothing could come in or out. &nbsp;Any Mana or matter burned when it came in contact with the barrier. &nbsp;The headquarters had been isolated. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You processed heat to the extreme to create this barrier. &nbsp;I never expected such a thing to be possible….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vadinet had already seen Artpe’s nearly flawless barrier. &nbsp;Etna’s way of creating a barrier looked simple and brutish. &nbsp;However, she couldn’t see any weak points in the barrier. &nbsp;Moreover, it had the ability to differentiate between enemies and allies. &nbsp;It implied that she had used spirits in creating the barrier. &nbsp;It wasn’t a simple fire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Help Roa.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Roa is capable of doing this alone…. &nbsp;Ah, yes. &nbsp;I understand.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Etna had already shed the body of a Demon. &nbsp;However, she didn’t feel comfortable killing other Demons. &nbsp;This was why she wanted to be alone, and Vadinet realized this fact. &nbsp;She nodded her head as she joined up with Roa.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘In the short term, you’ll suffer pain that is worse than death. &nbsp;However, I will not kill you all. &nbsp;Artpe will revert everything back to their true state, and at that time, he’ll give you guys a choice. &nbsp;If there is no changes to your behavior…...’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that time, she’ll burn all of them with her fire. &nbsp;Etna let out a big sigh as she took a step forward. &nbsp;Small fire spirits appeared around her. &nbsp;They laughed as they followed her movements. &nbsp;It seemed they weren’t aware of her feelings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The party easily took care of the Seros company’s headquarters. &nbsp;They recovered all the Artifacts and Magic Stones. &nbsp;Since these items were made for Demons, the items were emitting negative energy. &nbsp;However, Roa ruthlessly suck out all the corrupted energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nyaa. &nbsp;My stomach is full. &nbsp;Nyaa.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then you shouldn’t reveal so much skin.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nyaa. &nbsp;Nyaa-ah-ah.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vadinet and Roa bickered with each other as they gathered all the items. &nbsp;Roa’s base nature dominated over the Demonic energy. &nbsp;This was why Vadinet instinctually had favorable feelings towards Roa. &nbsp;She was a rotten holy priestess, but in the end, she was a holy priestess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“As expected, they came here······.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mmm?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Vadinet and Roa were focused on confiscating the Artifacts and magic stones, Etna was slowly walking down the corridor. &nbsp;She was extending her Mana to search her surrounding. &nbsp;Vadinet tilted her head in puzzlement when she noticed Etna’s atypical behavior. &nbsp;Etna let out a bitter laughter as she answered the unasked question.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“After the previous Demon King’s faction started to work in earnest, I wondered if their leaders had visited this place at least once. &nbsp;I thought they might have come here to take some of the valuables. &nbsp;It seems I was right.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Seros company was one of the three largest merchant companies on this continent, yet they had significantly less treasures compared to their stature. &nbsp;This was why Etna wondered if most of the previous Demon King’s forces had been ‘supplied’ by the Seros company, and she had been right in her assumption.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There is more food someplace else, nyaa?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you able to track them down?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The words spoken by Vadinet and Roa differed from each other, but they both wanted the same thing! &nbsp;Etna nodded her head as she replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes. &nbsp;However, I don’t know how many Demons there will be at that location. &nbsp;It might be dangerous if we go by ourselves.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You brought along Roa and me. &nbsp;I thought it was your plan to just charge into their camp.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Etna smirked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I did so, because I thought there might be a chance that we might find one of their leaders here…. &nbsp; Be careful everyone!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She cut short her words. &nbsp;She quickly raised her Mana as she yelled out. &nbsp;The power of the barrier was gathered at a single point. &nbsp;Incredible heat was condensed into a single attack. A man appeared as he took on the brunt of this attack.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Koohk. &nbsp;The barrier is capable of counterattacking by itself….!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The man had planned on exterminating the intruders as soon as he appeared. &nbsp;However, he hadn’t expected to consume all his prepared Mana in blocking the barrier’s counterattack. &nbsp;He rolled across the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His entrance was poor, but the Mana hidden inside his body was immense! &nbsp;Vadinet chanted her holy spell on instinct. &nbsp;Roa immediately attacked him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Food delivery service, nyaa-ah-ah!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Food delivery? Ooht!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If one possessed any corrupted energy within one’s body, it became absorbed by Roa! &nbsp;One just had to be near her. &nbsp;The Demon was being weakened. &nbsp;Roa’s ability was stronger than ever before. &nbsp; Even if the Demon was over level 390, he wasn’t exempt from Roa’s power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nyaa nyaa nyaa nyaa nyaa nyaa nyaa!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Shut up!]</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As expected, he wasn’t a normal Demon. &nbsp;In a flash, he detonated his Demonic energy outside of his body. &nbsp;He baited Roa to absorb it, then he unsheathed his sword. &nbsp;He stabbed the sharp sword towards Roa! &nbsp;Roa had been drunk on the Demonic energy. &nbsp;She desperately moved her body in the air to avoid the attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You don’t bother someone’s meal. &nbsp;I wouldn’t even bother a dog when it is eating its meal! &nbsp;Nyaa-ahhhhh!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Obviously, Vadinet was better at long ranged attacks. &nbsp;In the case of Etna, she dealt with the power of fire, but she was better at long ranged attacks rather than fighting in close proximity. &nbsp;The only one that could fight the Demon in close quarters was Roa.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vadinet’s blessing was immediately infused into Roa. &nbsp;It strengthened her. &nbsp;She was supposed be a Demonic beast, yet she was taking in holy power! &nbsp;It almost made one want to complain about the unfairness of it all!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[This means the hero has gotten a wind of what we are doing, and he made a move against us. &nbsp;However, there are no heroes here. &nbsp;He only sent the holy priestess. &nbsp;Even if he sends two holy priestess, it wouldn’t be enough.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had been distracted by Roa, who was constantly stealing Demonic energy from him. &nbsp;This was why Etna’s attack had completely taken him unawares. &nbsp;He glared at her as he resisted against the inferno. &nbsp;He was finally able to see the woman that had as much presence as himself.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It meant she couldn’t let him leave this place alive. &nbsp;Artpe had refined his spell. &nbsp;He had the ability to turn a Four Heavenly King into human. &nbsp;It was a key piece of information that had to kept secret until Artpe wanted to reveal his spell.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was Demonic energy coated around the Demon’s sword. &nbsp;Etna’s fire burned away the sword aura. &nbsp; The Demon looked devastated as he tried to bring back the aura, but Roa’s long claws raked across his face before he could do that!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Roa was the Greed Beast. &nbsp;The mere existence of her Mana had the power of eating away at everything. &nbsp;Her claws stripped away flesh and bone when they raked the Demon. &nbsp;The blood of the Demon dissipated after being eaten by her. &nbsp;It was a truly frightening sight. &nbsp;Even her allies felt their hair stand on end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other hand, the Demon did something much more impressive. &nbsp;Despite feeling horrible pain, he focused his Demonic energy into his sword. &nbsp;He stabbed the sword into Roa’s stomach.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Red blood flowed out of Roa. &nbsp;She let out a cry of anger. &nbsp;Vadinet quickly worked on healing Roa. &nbsp;Etna extended her Mana to attack the Demon. &nbsp;However, the Demonic energy from the Demon stretched out from his body, and it made contact with Roa’s blood, which was flowing down his sword. &nbsp;In the next moment, the flames assaulting his body just disappeared. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[It works.]</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She roughly knew that this Demon possessed high level, but it seemed he was one of the past Four Heavenly King. &nbsp;The fact that he was describing his ability proved her assumption! &nbsp;It was something only a Four Heavenly King would do!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Koohk!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His ability was legit. &nbsp;It didn’t matter if his enemy had an Innate ability, magic or close combat ability. &nbsp;He had a cheat ability that allowed him to copy the special abilities of those that he considered to be his enemy!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His Demonic energy completely ate the flames, which had been infused with Etna’s Mana. &nbsp;As a result, he amplified the destructive ability of the fire, and it was sent back towards Etna. &nbsp;Roa still hadn’t completely recovered from her wound. &nbsp;However, she let out a meow as she put herself in front of Etna.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It is Demonic energy! &nbsp;Nyaa-ah!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had used his ability to change Mana into Demonic energy. &nbsp;Moreover, he knew Roa would welcome this move. &nbsp;When he confirmed Roa moved as he predicted, she put on a smile. &nbsp;Etna became sure when she saw this. &nbsp;The Demon had been trying to bait Roa from the start!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[I’ll do this!]</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Roa was about to open her mouth. &nbsp;The Demon timed it perfectly as he switched places with Roa. &nbsp;His Innate ability has two functions!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he acquired Etna’s blood, he would gain affinity to fire. &nbsp;This fight would become much more difficult. &nbsp;Fortunately, Etna was aware of his aim.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In a flash, she surrounded herself with flames. &nbsp;She blocked his attack with the incredible heat. &nbsp;From the moment the sword pierced through the fire, it started to melt away. &nbsp;By the time the sword reached Etna, the sword had lost its edge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the next moment, the Mana infused within the fire was turned into Demonic energy. &nbsp;However, she couldn’t stop it from choking her. &nbsp;It wrapped around her neck.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After losing its edge, he could only produce the aura at the tip of the sword. &nbsp;He stabbed it towards Etna! &nbsp;Roa felt like a complete idiot after the Demonic energy was yanked out of her reach. &nbsp;She quickly moved towards the Demon. &nbsp;However, he didn’t even turn around. &nbsp;He created an enormous spear made out of Demonic energy, and he threw it towards her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[With this your power will be mine….. What!?]</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He stabbed his sword towards Etna. &nbsp;In a flash, Roa appeared near him, and she bit his neck. &nbsp;He was sure he had seen the Demonic energy spear engage with Roa. &nbsp;As he was having that thought, Etna’s fire engulfed him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Koohk. &nbsp;Get off me!]</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Roa hung onto him as she sucked away at his Demonic energy. &nbsp;This was why the Demon couldn’t resist against Etna’s flame. &nbsp;Moreover, Etna’s flame had a peculiar property. &nbsp;It couldn’t harm an ally.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Demon gritted his teeth as he tried to pry away Roa by using the aura blade once again. &nbsp;However, Roa’s body swayed as she dodged all his attack. &nbsp;The rate in which he was losing his Demonic energy remained the same. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[What······!?]</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Roa grinned. &nbsp;Etna moved farther away from the Demon as she created a large fireball.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘Shit. &nbsp;I should have given a report to his majesty first…..!’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Demon’s vision started to get blurry. &nbsp;As a last ditch attempt to get rid of Roa, he tried to turn the Mana within her body into Demonic energy. &nbsp;However, there was an unidentifiable energy source near her heart, and it immediately ate the Demonic energy.</span></p>
