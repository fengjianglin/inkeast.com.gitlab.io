He was only used by Teana? &nbsp;There was no way that was true. &nbsp;He had known what he was getting into from the start. &nbsp;The Demon and Medelrud had known each other’s intentions from the start, and they had been in a mutually beneficial relationship!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So tell me again. &nbsp;Who’s taking advantage of whom?”</span></p>
