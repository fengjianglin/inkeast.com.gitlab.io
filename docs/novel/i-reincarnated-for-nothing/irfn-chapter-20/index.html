 <p>Chapter 20 - Our Sunbae-nim Did This? (4)</p>
 <p><span style>“As expected, you finished this floor in couple days. &nbsp;The Anywhere company always…. &nbsp;Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mycenae made her entrance as she gave a lively greeting. &nbsp;However, her eyes turned round when she realized the Dungeon looked entirely different from before. &nbsp;There were no stairways leading up or down. &nbsp;There was only a square, and the Dungeon’s ceiling, which was slowly descending. &nbsp;&nbsp;And…..</span></p>
 <p><span style>She saw the two brats taking a shower inside the fountain placed in the middle of the square.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“....did a curse perhaps lower your mental capacity?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She wondered if they had lost their minds. &nbsp;She wanted to ask the question in the most tactful manner she could manage. &nbsp;Of course, it was worthless bringing it up with Artpe. &nbsp;He let out a snort as he looked over Mycenae with scorn in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W...what is it, customer?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh? &nbsp;Kyahhhhhhhk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want soap and clean underwear. &nbsp;I want it for Maetel and I.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Mycenae appeared, Maetel screamed as she hunched to hide her body. &nbsp;&nbsp;Artpe remained unbowed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was confident as he threw the silver coin towards Mycenae. &nbsp;He gave a list of what he needed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since they hadn’t been able to get out of the Dungeon for the past year, Mycenae understood why Artpe and Maetel were familiar with each other’s nude form. &nbsp;However, she never expected him to be so bold in front of her! &nbsp;Mycenae's face slightly reddened. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are a really rude customer. &nbsp;One silver won’t cover it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, that is why I’ll give you a second one.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait a moment, customer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe used a very weak form of Hyper Rubbing. &nbsp;It was on the level of Soft Rubbing where it merely felt as if the spell was scrubbing him. &nbsp;He applied soap, and it automatically scrubbed his body. &nbsp;When Maetel saw this, she pestered him until he used the spell on her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk. &nbsp;It can't be helped. &nbsp;Here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah-hee. &nbsp;This is ticklish. &nbsp;Hee-hee-hee-heek.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There really is nothing you cannot do with magic…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>For a moment, Mycenae thought about heading back, but the sight of the broken body of the Death Knight weighed heavily on her mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if it had met its death, Mycenae could get a rough idea of its record, and Mana that had remained behind in the corpse. &nbsp;The Death Knight had the potential of being a big jackpot compared to any other monsters within this Dungeon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, if there were no stairway leading downwards, it meant that they had reached the end of the Dungeon. &nbsp;In other words, this monster was the boss of the entire Dungeon. &nbsp;It was the Dungeon Boss!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you going to sell something to me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait until we clean ourselves.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think the fountain will become polluted before you can clean yourself, customer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In truth, they hadn’t been able to properly wash their bodies for past year. &nbsp;Thankfully, the buildup of grime on their bodies were swept away every time they leveled up. &nbsp;They had survived relying on this mechanism.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe and Maetel were thorough in washing their body. &nbsp;It took them exactly two hours to complete the task. &nbsp;It felt as if they were reborn. &nbsp;They even used the soap to wash their equipments made out of cloth. &nbsp;They washed it with a vengeance as bubbles formed. &nbsp;Artpe wore the underwear handed to him by Mycenae, and he dried his robe with Mana before putting it on. &nbsp;Then he sat down on the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hoo. &nbsp;I finally feel like I'm human again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now that you’ve washed yourself, you look a bit…. &nbsp;No, you are very handsome. &nbsp;If you grow a little bit more, you are going make many women cry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe snorted as he dismissed Mycenae’s words. &nbsp;He checked on how Maetel was doing. &nbsp;As expected, she had already put on all her clothes. &nbsp;She was growling as she glared at Mycenae.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Did she think Mycenae was targeting Artpe? &nbsp;Maetel always acted daft. &nbsp;Artpe let out a sigh, and he lightly flicked her forehead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s loot.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The gazes of Artpe, Maetel and Mycenae headed towards the corpse of the Death Knight. Artpe didn’t hesitate as he shot his Mana towards the corpse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A bright light rose into the air, and as the light dimmed, three Artifacts revealed themselves. &nbsp;When Maetel saw one of them, she let out a shout with a bright light in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s a long sword!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s yours.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yay!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The long sword looked similar to the one used by the Death Knight. &nbsp;However, this one looked sharper and more durable. &nbsp;It even had the ability to spike the user’s Mana in an instant to shoot it towards a single location. &nbsp;It was an unbelievably great Artifact. &nbsp;It strengthened Maetel’s weakness of not having a long range attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only downside was the fact that the level needed to equip it was quite high. &nbsp;One needed to be level 150…..</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Maetel]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Level : 154]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Excellent, Maetel. &nbsp;I have no more words to describe your cheat-like status.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ee-hee-hee. &nbsp;If you praise me so much, I’ll be embarrassed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It wasn’t a compliment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe looked at his own reflection on the surface of the water. &nbsp;He checked his own level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was level 145. &nbsp;He had almost achieved a miracle by raising his level to 145, but he was clearly inferior to Maetel, who had climbed over the level 150 mark. &nbsp;He didn’t compare favorably to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He thought this from the beginning, but he didn't see how it was possible for the Demon King to take over this world. The probability was less than 50%. &nbsp;In his past life, what were they thinking holding such a shining beacon of talent within the palace?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Customer. &nbsp;The helmet….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I knew ajumma would covet it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other side, Mycenae’s eyes were fixed on a helmet that looked similar to what the Death Knight had been wearing. &nbsp;It looked incredibly sturdy, and it was an Artifact that was very well suited to carry out its original goal of protecting the user.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes, if he was being honest, the helmet was a much better Artifact than the long sword. &nbsp;However…..</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Revengeful Death Knight’s Helm]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The curse will turn the wearer into a high rank Death Knight. &nbsp;When one equips the helm, all emotions and thought process will be amplified. &nbsp;The wearer’s Mana, skills and spells will be changed into having Darkness attribute, and it will be amplified. &nbsp;The wearer will grow by sucking in the energy of death.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the quintessential cursed item. &nbsp;It was a ridiculous cursed item that could bring down an entire city if one wasn’t careful. &nbsp;Artpe was aghast as he turned to look at Mycenae. &nbsp;He asked her a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you really want to buy this, ajumma?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We, in the Anywhere company, firmly believe that items aren’t capable of possessing sin. &nbsp;That is the purview of people.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mycenae’s eyes refused to leave the helm. &nbsp;She knew it was a cursed item, yet she was sure it was an item that could bring her profit. &nbsp;Her eyes were the eyes of a merchant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, Artpe knew about the greed that one felt for good items and wealth. &nbsp;It was what made a merchant a merchant…. &nbsp;Still, he had seen the world through his Read All Creation ability in his past life. &nbsp;The world always flowed with blood, because of treasures.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had always been surrounded by sea of blood thanks to his ability. &nbsp;This was why treasures didn’t hold much appeal to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There might come a day when you will regret this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do not worry about me, customer. &nbsp;I might not look it, but I’ve lived a very long time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes, it seemed his words weren’t registering with her, because he was young. &nbsp;She was the sort of person that won’t come to a realization until she experienced a big ordeal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe shrugged his shoulders as he handed her the helm. &nbsp;Mycenae put on a welcoming smile as she took the….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“780 gold.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eek!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know you’ll be selling it for over 1,000 gold. &nbsp;Don't make a big fuss about this. &nbsp;Just give me the money.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are young, and you’ve been stuck in this Dungeon for a year. &nbsp;So how are you so knowledgeable about the market prices!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, she took the helm from him. &nbsp;Her hands shook as she handed over the pouch containing the gold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A large dimensional magic spell was placed on this pouch. &nbsp;The price of this pouch is 50 gold, so I’ve place 730 gold within. &nbsp;You probably don’t want to carry around the entirety of the 780 gold. &nbsp;Please do me a favor by taking this deal!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All right. &nbsp;I’ll overlook it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a plain looking leather pouch, yet it was worth 50 gold! &nbsp;Maetel’s eyes spun, but Artpe didn't show any surprise. &nbsp;He took the pouch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In truth, he possessed another dimensional pouch. &nbsp;There was around 400 gold within that pouch. &nbsp;Their party now possessed money approaching 1,200 gold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So, there is only one thing left. &nbsp;Isn’t this just an egg?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ajumma. &nbsp;Does this really look like a normal egg?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The long sword and the helm were artifacts that was well-matched with the Death Knight. &nbsp;&nbsp;However, everyone had a hard time accepting that the last item was dropped by a Death Knight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was an egg that was small, black, and oval-shaped. &nbsp;When one touched it, one could feel the pulse of life from within it. &nbsp;Maetel’s mouth salivated as she looked down at it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you think this will be tasty, Artpe?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want you to think of it as something given birth by the Death Knight. &nbsp;Do you want to eat it when you know that fact?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m hungry!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Did she really want to eat it? &nbsp;Artpe let out a sigh as he flicked Maetel on her forehead. &nbsp;Then he put away the egg.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is a Chaos Egg born artificially by the Record Link. &nbsp;It is ridiculous to think that death was able to give life, but…. &nbsp;Since the Record Link had rarely been used throughout history, it is tough to come to a definite conclusion.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It would be funny if a Death Knight popped out from the Chaos Egg. &nbsp;However, he didn’t that would be the case.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had thoroughly checked it with his Read All Creation ability, but the only information he could glean was its name. &nbsp;Basically, he won’t know what will be born until the Chaos Egg hatches.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What will be born from it? &nbsp;If Artpe and my love can…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know what you are thinking about, but that won’t happen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heeng. &nbsp;Artpe, stop being mean to me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had no idea how he should incubate it. &nbsp;Artpe decided to put it within the inner pocket of his robe. &nbsp;If it broke, that was its fate. &nbsp;At that point, he’ll just make scrambled eggs with it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>All the items left behind by the Death Knight was collected. &nbsp;Their levels had increased, and their skills had developed. &nbsp;Now they equipped their equipment over their clean bodies. &nbsp;Artpe felt refreshed as he waved his hand towards Mycenae. &nbsp;He was saying goodbye to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can go now, ajumma. &nbsp;You bought everything you wanted.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why would I go? &nbsp;The most important Dungeon reward is still to come.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mycenae kept staring at the fountain placed in the middle of the square.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe and Maetel had wasted a lot of water by washing themselves in it, but the fountain kept pumping out clear water from some unknown place. &nbsp;It looked as if Mycenae believed that there was a secret kept within it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won’t give that up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As always, I just want to purchase items at a fair price…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ajumma.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe smiled sweetly. &nbsp;Mycenae had remarked on this fact before, but his charming smile wasn’t something that should exist on the face of a thirteen year old.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll see you again next time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heht…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>For a brief moment, she had been mesmerized by his smile. &nbsp;However, she recovered her wits when she heard the cold voice that slipped out of Artpe’s mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her cheeks puffed out, and she banged on her blameless cart. &nbsp;She shouted towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha. &nbsp;I really can’t win against you. &nbsp;All right. &nbsp;I just have to leave, right? &nbsp;Please look kindly on the Anywhere company in the future! &nbsp;Tsk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mycenae disappeared from where she had been standing. &nbsp;Maetel grumbled as she stared at the spot where Mycenae had disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t like that ajumma.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That ajumma is neither good or bad. &nbsp;She is only a merchant, who puts profit above all else. We were able purchase supply without much fuss thanks to the ajumma. &nbsp;Moreover, we were able to get decent price for the items we sold.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actually, he had received a very generous amount, but Artpe didn’t want to get into that topic here. &nbsp;He slowly walked towards the fountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes, Mycenae's hunch had been spot on. &nbsp;It was likely that everything left within the Dungeon was gathered at the fountain. &nbsp;This was probably the true reward given to the hero, who overcame all the tests.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had used a rotten method to pass the test, but they had passed it. &nbsp;It was time for them to see the fruit of their ordeal, which had lasted for a year.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The fountain was put there to fool us. &nbsp;The entrance is below it. &nbsp;The reward is also placed underneath it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is something below? &nbsp;Shouldn’t there only be the ground below?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where do you think the water is coming from?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe smirked as he gave instructions to Maetel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s destroy the fountain.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel was confident only when it came to destroying stuff. &nbsp;She gave an energetic reply as she raised her newly acquired long sword. &nbsp;She focused her Mana within it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her level was above 150, so she possessed a sufficient pool of Mana within her. &nbsp;She didn’t need to be linked with Artpe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow. &nbsp;I can feel my Mana gathering at the tip of my sword.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ready, aim….. &nbsp;Fire!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh-eet!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The long sword was black, but when she gathered her Mana into the sword, it let out a bright golden light. &nbsp;It was the same color as Maetel’s hair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The energy shot out from the tip of the sword, and it flew in a straight line towards the fountain. &nbsp;The energy impacted on the fountain, and it was destroyed easily. &nbsp;A hidden hallway was revealed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They hadn’t expected another underground space, but it was a large space where people could reside. &nbsp;The clear underground water encompassed and flowed around the space. &nbsp;A clean and &nbsp;refined stone surface covered the hallway.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a single altar placed in the middle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.....Artpe, what is that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel found two books placed on something that looked to be an altar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One book had a red leather cover, and the other one had a blue leather cover. &nbsp;Of course, Artpe immediately knew the identity of the books when he saw them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Those are Skill Books….. &nbsp;Ha.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t just normal Skill Books. &nbsp;These were Unique Skill Books that could be learned only by ‘Heroes’.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he realized the implications of this, Artpe felt electrified. &nbsp;He had kept his expectations in check, but this Dungeon had really been made for a hero. &nbsp;At that moment, what he thought was a coincidence turned into destiny!</span></p>
