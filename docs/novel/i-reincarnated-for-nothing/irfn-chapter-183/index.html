 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This place is the headquarters of the Anywhere company.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You really are a great merchant!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Maetel was letting out a bright laughter as she raised her thumb towards Mycenae. &nbsp;She was sure that Maetel had learned that gesture from Artpe. &nbsp;Mycenae had an odd expression on her face. &nbsp;She wondered if she really should be doing this. &nbsp;She mumbled to herself as she looked at her surrounding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hoo-ooh. &nbsp;I really wonder if we are doing this for humanity….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We are doing it for Artpe. &nbsp;Isn’t that enough?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Customer, you really haven’t changed from the first time I met you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“My chest became larger than ajumma’s chest during that time?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Shut up!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were in a medium-sized territory within Diaz. &nbsp;There was in a shabby building located on the Serata boulevard. &nbsp;The headquarters of the Anywhere company was located beneath this building.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wow. &nbsp;I sense people hiding beneath this place. &nbsp;What are they all doing here? &nbsp;Shouldn’t they be fighting the Demon King’s army?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The fight against the Demon King’s army is another business opportunity to the companies. &nbsp;This why the companies never go all in on a venture.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Silpennon snorted at Mycenae’s slick explanation. &nbsp;The young king of Diaz had been invited as a special guest to the hero’s party. &nbsp;The Anywhere company had shamelessly built a secret base within his country. &nbsp;Instead of feeling anger, he felt a bit dejected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These bastard were all traitors. &nbsp;It wouldn’t be enough to annihilate their entire family and relatives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I want to loot them, and I really want to put it all back into my kingdom’s coffers…..”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“However, Artpe said to bring it all to him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was short and clear with her words as she unsheathed her sword. &nbsp;There was a violent air around Maetel. &nbsp;Diaz’s coffers had been looted by Artpe, so he thought taking a little bit of the loot would be ok. &nbsp;However, he quietly gave up on that idea when he saw Maetel’s savage smile. &nbsp;She didn’t look like the girl hero. &nbsp;She looked liked a notorious killer. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘I’m pretty sure Maetel remembers her past life….’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She continued to grind her teeth for no reason when she looked at Silpennon. &nbsp;Moreover, she was unusually obsessed with Artpe. &nbsp;It was quite scary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, he had mostly given up on his affections towards her after awakening to his past memories. &nbsp;He didn’t plan on pursuing Maetel for her affections. &nbsp;However, they had shared camaraderie and friendship in their past lives &nbsp;They had shared joys and sorrows for many years. &nbsp;He still wanted to be friendly with her. &nbsp;He still wanted to be her comrade and friend.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Maetel.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why are you asking for me, Red?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No. &nbsp;It is nothing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seemed she was tired of calling him redhead, so she had shortened it to Red! &nbsp;Silpennon became resigned as he stepped forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You taking action is a good plan. &nbsp;However, my Innate ability is quite helpful in these types of situation. &nbsp;Artpe probably sent you guys along with me thinking this task can’t be done with just my ability…. &nbsp;Just wait here. &nbsp;I’ll steal everything within this headquarters.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmm. &nbsp;You are overflowing with confidence. &nbsp;It suits you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah ah. &nbsp;Anywhere is cooked now…..”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mycenae had some knowledge about the ability that had awakened within Silpennon. &nbsp;This was why she had a complicated expression on her face as she mumbled to herself. &nbsp;It didn’t take long. &nbsp;It goes without saying that Silpennon backed up his big talk by stealing everything from the Anywhere company. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Silpennon’s group finished their work without running into much difficulty. &nbsp;The Anywhere company placed all their high priced items in the storehouse within the headquarters. &nbsp;They didn’t need to visit multiple locations. &nbsp;They just had to loot one place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Above all else, Silpennon’s Innate ability allowed them to smoothly finish their work from beginning to end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The problem was looting Might and Seros. &nbsp;Unlike the Anywhere company, the location of their headquarters was common knowledge. &nbsp;That is why their wealth was stored in multiple locations. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“These companies possess a spell that can transport their wealth.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Regina spoke those words, the party went through the building, which was considered to be at the heart of the Might merchant company. &nbsp;It wasn’t as if they were alone. &nbsp;They weren’t being bothered, because everyone in the building had been knocked out by Sienna and Elrick’s shield charge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There is a reason why it is risky to use Spatial magic. &nbsp;It leaves behind a Record. &nbsp;It allows others to track you down.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That sounds very complicated, but I think I get the gist of it. &nbsp;You are saying that Records have been left behind if the items passed through the headquarters?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Right. &nbsp;The items that are considered to be extremely valuable are brought to the headquarters first,. &nbsp;They measure the value of the items. &nbsp;Afterwards, the items are transferred to various branches depending on their worth, volume and type of items.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Regina’s knowledge was very thorough. &nbsp;The Might company previously had their headquarters located in a city within the former magic kingdom of Aedia. &nbsp;Regina was the secret weapon developed by Aedia, so she had investigated about the Might company over the long years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That means we can use these Records to go to the other branches!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nope.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sienna had used her head to come up with an answer, but Regina firmly shook her head in disagreement. &nbsp;Sienna tilted her head in confusion. &nbsp;Regina raised her staff as she emitted magical energy. &nbsp;If other magicians heard her words, they would have let out a shout of disbelief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m not going to them. &nbsp;I’ll activate the Record to call them back.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“······call back the Artifacts and Magic Stones?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes. I’m not just using Spatial magic. &nbsp;I’m reading the Mana pattern of the Artifacts. &nbsp;I can read their current location, and I’ll rewind their Record.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ok. &nbsp;I have no idea what you are saying!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sienna replied with a bright smile. &nbsp;Regina lightly tapped Sienna’s head with her staff. &nbsp;Instead of elaborating further, Regina activated her magic. &nbsp;She had acquired the Record of the Winter Queen. &nbsp;She used a magic that only she could use. &nbsp;She was able to see the Records related to Mana with her strengthened eyes. &nbsp;She used a summoning spell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A frightening wave of Mana immediately arose from her. &nbsp;It broke apart the building’s roof. &nbsp;As the light of the stars illuminated her, Regina started to summon the items by ones and twos!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wow! &nbsp;It is still coming out!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sienna, what are you doing? &nbsp;You should gather the items.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“However, I sense living beings….. &nbsp; Ah! &nbsp;I see! &nbsp;It isn't just Artifacts and Magic Stones. &nbsp;I think people are being summoned too?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A merchant had appeared alongside an Artifact. &nbsp;The merchant had a death-grip on the Artifact. &nbsp;Sienna lightly bashed the merchant with her shield. &nbsp;The merchant was sent flying over the roof. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Regina calmly spoke about what was going on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If one wants to interfere with a summon magic, one needs to be in direct contact with the subject being summoned. &nbsp;Mana can be injected into the subject to stop the summoning. &nbsp;If one fails, one gets summoned alongside the subject.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah! &nbsp;Over there!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sienna let out an innocent laughter as she ruthlessly swung her shield. &nbsp;The merchants fainted when they were hit with the shield. &nbsp;It wasn’t just the custodians of each branches being summoned. &nbsp;Dungeon Merchants that possessed Artifacts and Magic Stones started to appear by ones and twos.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“T...this place is...!?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This makes no sense. &nbsp;I couldn’t even put up a fight with my Mana before being summoned…. &nbsp;Kah-hoohk!?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The merchants tried to put up a decent fight, but Regina’s summon magic was too powerful. &nbsp;One had to be at least level 300 to be able to interfere with the Mana pattern she wove. &nbsp;Aside from Artpe’s party and Silpennon’s party, there were no other humans that had exceeded level 300.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It is endless. &nbsp;Tsk. &nbsp;These dirty bastards are trying to make money while humans are currently dying on the front-line. &nbsp;They squirreled away all these items….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It is understandable. &nbsp;They just think differently from us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sienna quietly spoke her words as she swung her shield. &nbsp;The Dungeon Merchants, who had just been summoned, were starting to unsheathe their weapons. &nbsp;However, they all fainted when their heads were bashed in by the corner of Sienna’s shield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“However, oppa’s will was just stronger than theirs.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It becomes complicated when you start talking about might makes right…. &nbsp;However, Artpe is &nbsp;absolute in your eyes, so I won’t waste time arguing with you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In this venture, Elrick also thought Artpe was in the right. &nbsp;The human realm was in danger of falling, yet the companies were squirreling away so much resources. &nbsp;This meant they were preparing for the human realm’s loss. &nbsp;They were preparing for the day when the Demon King &nbsp;conquers the whole world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The humans were already at a clear disadvantage. &nbsp;It might have been understandable if the companies had pulled back their resources later on, so they could fund a resistance. &nbsp;However, they were keeping these resources back while the battle between the two sides were close. &nbsp;It was obvious as to what they were trying to pull.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Rei, how much more do you have to summon?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Might company has a lot of stuff. &nbsp;I’m also going to summon all their Dungeon Merchants, so I think it’ll take 5 more hours.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Five hours······ Yes, let’s finish this quickly, so we can return.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Agreed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Regina was maintaining her summon magic, she extended her Mana towards a different direction. &nbsp;There was a communication system used by the Might company, and it extended across the territory of Aedia. &nbsp;She made it so that the merchants couldn’t communicate with each other. &nbsp;She had activated a wide scale communication interference magic. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t have enough energy to be surprised any more.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I wonder what’s happening on Etna unni’s side. &nbsp;Do you think everything is going smoothly?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I have no idea why she insisted on going with the holy priestess, but…. &nbsp; She should be doing well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sienna and Elrick looked at each other, and they tilted their head in puzzlement. &nbsp;Of course, Sienna didn’t realize that such a small gesture made Elrick’s heart beat faster. &nbsp;Her thoughts were solely on Etna.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘From what I heard from oppa, unni insisted on going to Seros. &nbsp;It was as if she knew the location of the headquarters…. &nbsp; She picked out Roa and Vadinet unni for her party. &nbsp;Does that mean…..’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She knew it was mere speculation, but Sienna was worried. &nbsp;She hoped that Etna wouldn’t suffer a wounded heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that moment, Etna was on the move with Roa and Vadinet. &nbsp;They were walking in the streets of Paladia’s capital. &nbsp;They were in Lihazeta..</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nyaa nyaa. &nbsp;I don't like places without corrupted energy. &nbsp;Nyaa. &nbsp;I want to see master. &nbsp;Nyaa-ah.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you implying that Artpe-nim is corrupted, kitty?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nyaa. &nbsp;I like master, because he is cozy. &nbsp;Nyaa-ah. &nbsp;I also like that he is adequately rotten, nyaa!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ho-oh. &nbsp;In my opinion, I think your eyes are rotten.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nyaa-ahhh······.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The holy priestess was able to eliminate Demonic energy, and the Demonic beast was able to eat the Demonic energy. &nbsp;The fight of the century was about to start between the two, but Etna had extended her fire. &nbsp;She separated the two. &nbsp;She had burned away all the Mana the two had been using. &nbsp;Her skill was frightening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We are almost there.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That······ Ms Etna? &nbsp;I can confirm that the headquarter of the Seros company is within Paladia. &nbsp;However, it is as I’ve said earlier. &nbsp;It isn’t in Lihazeta. &nbsp;It is located in one of the outer cities….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That place is empty now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ughh.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since Lihazeta was the capital of Paladia, it was covered with countless spells. &nbsp;A good number of those spells had been destroyed in the last commotion, but new replacement spells had been placed. &nbsp;Since temples were located all over Lihazeta, there was a great amount of ambient holy energy. &nbsp;Even Artpe, who possessed the Read All Creation ability, would have a hard time finding what he wanted in this place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It happened when Jeriet was slowly subverting Paladia as he masqueraded as the fake pope. &nbsp;You were at the heart of that situation, so you probably are well informed about it, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes. &nbsp;Of course. &nbsp;Artpe-nim appeared like a shooting star, and his actions….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In truth, master didn’t do much. &nbsp;Nyaa-ah.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Shut your mouth. ”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Etna ignored the two girls, who were growling at each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“At the time, Artpe had come up with the best course of action. &nbsp;He checked all the priests, and he filtered out the corrupted ones. &nbsp;He killed them before they could give excuses. &nbsp;He was bold. &nbsp;Afterwards, he made sure the priests wouldn’t be led astray….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that moment, Etna came to a stop, and she poked the ground. &nbsp;At one point, a magic circle containing an enormous amount of Mana had been placed there. &nbsp;There was a faint trace of another magic circle being made there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After receiving Etna’s Mana, the magic circle started to power up. &nbsp;Vadinet’s eyes widened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is the vestige of a teleportation magic….?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Artpe always commits fully to his actions. &nbsp;That is why he missed one possibility.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vadinet could somewhat guess at what this possibility was. &nbsp;As the magic circle expanded, it surrounded the whole party. &nbsp;In the next moment, they were in an underground corridor within a large building.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nyaa?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Roa sniffed the air. &nbsp;She tilted her head as she spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I sense Demonic energy, nyaa-ahhh.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No way. &nbsp;Is it the Four Heavenly King Jeriet······!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You are correct.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He admitted it with a truly depressed voice. &nbsp;The former Four Heavenly King took a step forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He was the first one to defect to the previous Demon King’s faction. &nbsp;He infiltrated the human realm to support them. &nbsp;The first thing he did was to acquire the Seros company for them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Demons that were easily over level 300 started to appear in the corridor by ones and twos. &nbsp;It seemed they had hastily come to the corridor after they sensed the teleportation magic. &nbsp;Roa bared her teeth at them. &nbsp;Vadinet was taken aback by what she saw.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was Jeriet. &nbsp;He was supposed to the weakest amongst the Four Heavenly King, and he had been the first to die.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Arpte hadn’t known that Jeriet had acquired the Seros company. &nbsp;He had gone on without knowing about Jeriet’s machination.</span></p>
