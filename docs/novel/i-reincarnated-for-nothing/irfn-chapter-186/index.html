 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the past, he had boasted about it to his party members. &nbsp;In terms of knowledge about the Demon realm, no one could touch him. &nbsp;He had lived a long time before he was noticed by the Demon King. &nbsp;After he started working under the Demon King as a subordinate, he had been able to travel all over the Demon realm as if it was his own backyard. &nbsp;He thoroughly searched the Demon Realm using his Read All Creation ability.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The merfolks are doing well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If you bring her along, our success rate will increase further.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It is as I’ve said to Sherryl. &nbsp;The Demon race will return to the Demon realm. &nbsp;I placed her in a position where she’ll be able to rack up a high body count.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As expected, a straight on battle wasn’t any fun! &nbsp;It was more fun to poke one’s enemy at a weak point! &nbsp;Silpennon smirked at Artpe’s words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We’ve created a very favorable situation for our side. &nbsp;It’ll be difficult for them to lose this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They'll win this war. &nbsp;It is a given. &nbsp;However, that isn’t important.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If it was a world where magic and levels didn’t exist, it might have been enough to just end the war. &nbsp;However, the world had monsters that could single handedly slaughter millions of people. &nbsp;There were beings that could manipulate the hearts of humans. &nbsp;There were Demonic beasts that could shake the foundation of existence. &nbsp;If these beings were left behind after the war, the race called humans will be defeated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They’ll all disappear······.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Demonification of humans...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Silpennon frowned as he thought about the envoy that had tried to entice him. It really was an unpleasant memory.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is the current Demon King similar to the past Demon King? Is he the type that can’t stand the presence of humans on the face of this world?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The current Demon King just wants control over everything. &nbsp;He truly wants to become the owner of this world.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s right. &nbsp;You described him perfectly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a very disgusting and cruel business. &nbsp;However, the hero’s party was able to grow thanks to the current Demon King. &nbsp;On the other hand, Artpe had never met the past Demon King….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If we had moved more conservatively, I think our enemy would have been a much scarier foe. &nbsp;However, the previous Demon King’s goal is more clear than the current Demon King. &nbsp;His goal is to make all the humans into Demons.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He is a being from the pervious hero’s era. &nbsp;He might be working in the direct opposite direction as the current Demon King.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t want to talk about that damned subae.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Artpe spoke in a sullen manner as he turned his head away. &nbsp;The Steel Horse had run straight through the waters where the merfolk were stationed. &nbsp;They were flying above the Demon realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they first entered the Demon realm, they had tried to avoid any attention as they charged straight towards the Demon King’s castle. &nbsp;Now they wanted to be noticed. &nbsp;This was why they were overtly revealing their energy as they traveled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What if the previous Demon King shows up in the middle of everything?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We’ll have to fight him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At Artpe’s words, Elrick looked as if the world was crumbling around himself. &nbsp;Artpe cackled as he explained himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We’ll just continue to carry out our spell. &nbsp;Why do you think we gathered so much Artifact? We have plenty of power to punch up. &nbsp;We can overcome the level difference. &nbsp; ….if the level difference is too large, it might be unreasonable. &nbsp;However, I don’t think that’ll happen.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was making a judgement based on their experience against the Four Heavenly Kings. &nbsp;He was sure! ······maybe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Basically, you have no countermeasures!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah. &nbsp;Have you ever heard of a hero’s story where the Demon King wipes the floor with the hero? &nbsp;There is no way that happens! &nbsp;The hero suffers until he is on the verge of death. &nbsp;At that time, his party member makes a costly sacrifice, and it barely allows the hero to stab the sword into the Demon King’s heart…. &nbsp;That party member might be you, Elrick.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Heeek!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You can be at ease, Elrick. &nbsp;I’ll put your grave in a sunny place… &nbsp; Ouch.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Artpe teased Elrick. &nbsp;Etna flicked his forehead before he could scare Elrick a little bit more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You have to think of a way where we win without losing anyone.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I already know that’s the best outcome.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the old stories, everyone pulled through, and as the curtain comes downs, they all laughed with each other. &nbsp;However, that outcome was only possible in the old stories. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In his past life, Artpe always experienced farewells alongside victories. &nbsp;He had been lucky in his current life. &nbsp;His ability had been strengthened, and Maetel’s ability was too much of a cheat. &nbsp;This was why he hadn’t experienced any farewells yet…..</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll try my best to prevent any loss, but it can happen. &nbsp;I wanted to prepare everyone for that possibility, so they would be hurt less when the time comes…..”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hoo. ······you always had a very loving heart.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It is like you are giving us the disease and the medicine at the same time…..”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Etna extended both her arms, and she wrapped them around Artpe’s head. &nbsp;Artpe pouted, but he didn’t put up much of a fight. &nbsp;It might have something to do with her rank in their past lives. &nbsp;When it came to Etna, he was a bit docile towards her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She had been equally upset as Artpe when she faced the Demons in the headquarters of the Seros company. &nbsp;This was how she would soothe her party using Artpe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“······ah.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If she moved this close to him, she felt the need to escalate her skinship towards Artpe. &nbsp;However, Etna had quickly gotten used to how things worked in this party. &nbsp;This was why she had realized something. &nbsp;If she created a mood between the two of them….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Y... you are cheating! &nbsp;You are using the allure of an older woman…! &nbsp;It isn’t something we can recreate!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“However, Artpe doesn’t like older women. &nbsp;Isn’t that right, Artpe?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Agreed. &nbsp;Artpe likes younger women, who are barely legal.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What the hell did you say?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone in the periphery stopped her from going any further. &nbsp;Etna laughed as she separated from Artpe. &nbsp;He was mobbed by the girls.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In truth, she didn’t mind it. &nbsp;Her life was no longer being threatened for liking someone. &nbsp;She was plenty happy with that fact. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it looked plenty dangerous from the perspective of the outsiders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It mainly had to do with the risk to Artpe’s life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If Artpe doesn’t die by the Demon King, he’ll one day be killed by one of these women.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“When you say it like that, it sounds quite serious. &nbsp;It has an ominous ring to it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You always misrepresent my words.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Silpennon grumbled as he turned his gaze away. &nbsp;After Artpe used his Reinforcement ability, the Steel Horse had become its best possible version of itself. &nbsp;It was no longer a normal existence. &nbsp;It travelled at a mind boggling speed as it traveled above the Demon realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, monsters could see them, so there were cases when the monsters tried to chase after them. &nbsp;However, they were rarely attacked by Demons. &nbsp;It seemed most of the Demons had been mobilized into the human realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Maybe, they’ll arrive at the Demon King’s castle…the ruins of the Demon King’s castle without being bothered by anyone. &nbsp;As anticipated, they were quickly closing the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this rate, it might take them couple hours to arrive at their destination. &nbsp;The Reinforcement had been used on top of the Dwarven technology, so the impossible was made possible. &nbsp;Silpennon laughed at the thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Demon King’s castle······.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“······aren’t you afraid, Mr Silpennon?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was Aria’s question. &nbsp;The rest of the women were all busy tormenting Artpe. &nbsp;She was the only one that continued to observe Silpennon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After regaining the memories from his past life, she had been the most sensitive to his change. &nbsp;Everyone realized that Silpennon had changed dramatically. &nbsp;Unlike everyone else, she was a bit afraid that Silpennon had changed at a fundamental level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since she possessed the Innate ability called Assimilation, she might be much more empathetic compared to the others. &nbsp;Silpennon absentmindedly thought about her abilities as he tilted his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m not sure. &nbsp;It feels as if the fight is inevitable. &nbsp;I’m afraid, but that doesn’t matter. &nbsp;There is no benefit in trying to avoid this foe.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It didn’t matter if their foe was the current Demon King or the past Demon King. &nbsp;Demon Kings were inherently at the extreme end of the power scale. &nbsp;In the end, it was an either/or situation. &nbsp;Either the human race or the Demon race prevailed at the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn’t something that can be avoided, so he was resigned to it. &nbsp;Aria wasn’t able to do that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I······ I am afraid. &nbsp;Of course, I am afraid of my own death…. &nbsp;However, I am afraid of Mr. Silpennon dying.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“······.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Silpennon became silent. &nbsp;This was basically a confession of love! &nbsp;She was completely devoted to him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If it was the previous Silpennon, he wouldn’t have known this. &nbsp;However, he possessed the memories from his previous life. &nbsp;He had experienced his own anxious love towards Maetel. &nbsp;Silpennon could see it all in Aria’s gesture and words. &nbsp;He could feel her deep love towards him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If anything, he became annoyed towards his previous self. &nbsp;How could he not notice something so obvious?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You······.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I want to help the two heroes, but in truth, I didn't’ want to join this party. &nbsp;I wanted to stay in the human realm with Mr Silpennon…. &nbsp;If Mr. Silpennon dies, I…..”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Silpennon heard her words, he didn’t look at Aria. &nbsp;He turned towards the others. &nbsp;It seem everyone was still focused on Artpe. &nbsp;There seemed to be a wall of women around Artpe. &nbsp;It seemed they hadn’t heard Aria’s voice. &nbsp;He let out a sigh as he turned his penetrating gaze towards Aria.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Aria.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I...if I don’t tell you this, I don’t think I’ll have another opportunity!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Aria’s cheeks turned red. &nbsp;At the very least, she knew what her words implied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It is as Artpe-nim said before. &nbsp;The hero’s story always ends with a sacrifice. &nbsp;Aside from the hero, it is very rare for comrades of the hero to come out unscathed in the end…….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If the hero doesn’t have his comrades, he won’t be able to kill the Demon King by himself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“However, there is no need for Mr. Silpennon to be the comrade that’ll be sacrificed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You will jinx me if you keep saying that.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seemed Artpe’s story had scared Aria instead of Elrick.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Silpennon let out a sigh as he lightly grabbed her hand. &nbsp;Aria let out little moan, and her already red cheeks turned redder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It is as Artpe had said. &nbsp;If one acts stronger before the final battle, one always dies at the final battle. &nbsp;That is why I won’t act strong. &nbsp;I won’t make any promise about the future, and I won’t reminisce about some random past memories.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“S...so what should we do?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What do you mean what should we do? &nbsp;We are already holding hands, and we’ll continue to hold hands until we arrive at the Demon King’s castle.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“······what is that?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Strength exited Aria’s shoulders. &nbsp;It seemed the tension within her dissipated. &nbsp;Silpennon was able to elicit the desired effect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Silpennon let out a light sigh as he sent a low amount of power towards her. &nbsp;It allowed the two of them to share each other’s body temperature.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Maybe, his feeling had been conveyed to her. &nbsp;He was sure it was conveyed to her when she added her power into her hand. &nbsp;There was a small smile on his face as he turned his head slightly away her. &nbsp;He was too embarrassed to meet her eyes right now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Damn it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah. &nbsp;What is it again?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It always happened when a pleasant and affectionate moment arose between the two of them. &nbsp;It was quickly destroyed. &nbsp;It was always destroyed by Artpe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I want to never come across a new variable like this again. &nbsp;I want to throw it in the trash”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I really want to throw you off the Steel Horse right now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had made a promise with Aria, so he hadn’t let go of Aria’s hand. &nbsp;He just hid their entwined hands from Artpe as he complained. &nbsp;It was unknown as to whether Artpe knew what Silpennon was feeling. &nbsp;Artpe just let out a dejected smile as he pointed outside of the Steel Horse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you see that Dungeon over there?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“······Dungeon?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why is there another Dungeon here right now?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Maetel screamed out loud, and everyone agreed with her sentiment. &nbsp;Artpe felt the same way as her, but he couldn’t just drive past it. &nbsp;He couldn’t ignore the Dungeon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Dungeon was placed on the road to the Demon King’s castle, so it was obvious that the Dungeon had been created not too long ago. &nbsp;There was something carved atop the entrance, and the letters were made using powerful Demonic energy. &nbsp;Artpe was the only one that could see it with his Read All Creation ability.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘Final Recipe.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Shit. &nbsp;That bastard heard me talk behind his back.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Artpe cursed in a very low voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a Dungeon made by the current Demon King.</span></p>
