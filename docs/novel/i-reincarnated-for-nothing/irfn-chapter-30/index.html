 <p>Chapter 30 - Dungeon, Evolution and Success (4)</p>
 <p><span style>“Ooh-ahhhhhhh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are doing well, Silpennon. &nbsp;You should roll a little bit to the left. &nbsp;There’s a lot of dusts over there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You evil bastaaaaaaaard!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Silpennon let out a weird groan as he rolled around on the ground. &nbsp;This was a phenomena that occurred when one leveled up all at once.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“His highness barely helped in killing that Slime, so why did he get a share of the EXP?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unlike Silpennon, Leseti hadn’t received a single iota of experience. &nbsp;She grinded her teeth as she asked the question. She was jealous of the crown prince, who was rolling around on the ground. &nbsp;He actually looked favorably on the female knight for her sentiment, so he gave a friendly reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your understanding of this matter is fundamentally wrong. &nbsp;That Slime started eating its brethren, because it feared Silpennon. &nbsp;At that point, Silpennon had pulled the aggro of that Slime, and he probably inflicted some damage too. &nbsp;This is the reason why it counted as Silpennon contributing to the battle.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It isn’t much of a contribution!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leseti was acting as if she was dissatisfied about Silpennon’s growth. &nbsp;Sipennon bellowed from the ground as he sacrificed his clothes by wiping the dust of the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ggoo-ahhhhh! &nbsp;Your master is leveling up, so why are you complaining!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However, your highness, you are useless even if you level up a lot!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you just say I’m useless…. &nbsp;Ooh-gyahhhhhhh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe wondered how the relation between the master and servant would change in the future. &nbsp;However, it was no concern of his…. &nbsp;Artpe let out a sigh as he gave a supplemental explanation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is as you’ve said. &nbsp;The percentage of EXP given to Silpennon wasn’t high. &nbsp;At most, it was around three percent. &nbsp;But…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you saying he was able to achieve such an explosive growth with only 3 percent….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ve hit the nail on the head.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only traces of the Huge Slime left behind was the wreckage. &nbsp;It had been a level 200 Dungeon monster, and it was the Dungeon’s boss. &nbsp;It had been a Elite Ultra Rank monster.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Normally, the monster’s record and EXP increased substantially based on Rank and its position. &nbsp;Even if Silpennon had barely contributed, it wasn’t strange to see him increase in level by over 20.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Moreover, you don’t have to worry too much about his Skills either. &nbsp;We’ll get the [Cud] Bonus too.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cud was a humorous term that was coined for the skill where one’s Skill grew once more after the monster was killed. &nbsp;The skill grew under the influence of the monster’s Record, and the achievements in battle. &nbsp;However, Leseti’s expression still indicated that she was having a hard time accepting the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Still, he didn’t even strike that particular Slime with his sword…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, it seems he was able to do so.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Silpennon was finished with his continuous level up. &nbsp;He shakily got up from the ground. &nbsp;Artpe spoke lightly as he looked over Silpennon with his Read All Creation ability. &nbsp;Above his head, there were words that were more spectacular than what was seen on Maetel once before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Silpennon Le Diaz]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Level : 49]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Crown Prince]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Dual Wield Lv7]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Battle Step Lv6]</span></p>
 <p><span style>When facing the Slime, it would have been enough to just stab it once. &nbsp;He would have needed to tweak the Slime’s body. &nbsp;When the level 200 high rank Class monster was killed, the result of the battle was used on his skills. &nbsp;This was why Silpennon possessed ridiculously high level Skills compared to his actual level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On top of that, he was so exceptionally talented that there was a bonus added to his skill growth. &nbsp;If one only considered the basic Skill level, Silpennon wasn’t that far off from Leseti!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, Artpe wasn’t going to breakdown all the information, but it was enough information for Leseti to become shocked and anguished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If I knew this would happen, I would have hit it with my sword once!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If the monster doesn’t become truly threatened by your action, it will have no effect. &nbsp;Silpennon went through his growth, because he attacked the Slime before it evolved.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why does the prince always have good luck!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you dissatisfied with my luck being good, Leseeeeeeeti!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leseti kept complaining, and Silpennon gnashed his teeth. &nbsp;At that point, he decided to just drop the subject. However, it seemed Leseti still had questions she wanted to ask of Artpe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Does this mean you guys are too high in level to experience level ups from the Slime’s EXP?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, we aren’t there yet…. &nbsp;We are just used to this kind of incidents.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You became accustomed to it!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmmm. &nbsp;Could you stand still for a moment.?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kyahhh!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe could see his reflection in her large innocent blue eyes, so he activated his Read All Creation ability to check his own info.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Artpe]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Hero]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Level : 163]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Mana String Lv7]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Hyper Rubbing Lv24]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Mana Control Lv35]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Throw Lv28]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[······]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You...you! &nbsp;Do you think I’ll fall for you if you do this! &nbsp;You brat! &nbsp;You braaaaat!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“....why did I promote such a doofus to the role as my knight protector...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had suddenly become Artpe’s mirror. &nbsp;Leseti’s face turned red as she got angry. &nbsp;However, Artpe was deep within his thoughts, so her words didn’t really register with. &nbsp;He let go of the angry Leseti, and he wallowed deep in his woes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is way too fast.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had graduated from the beginner’s Dungeon at level 145. &nbsp;He had fought the knights dressed in black not too long ago, but they were lower in level by dozen levels or more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he had increased by 18 levels in one fell swoop when the Huge Slime was killed. &nbsp;It goes without saying that the Skills used in killing the Slime had grown too.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if their opponent was special, this was too much.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he was thinking this, he turned his thoughts towards the Mana Link and the Record Divide.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Did Maetel’s ability perhaps influence me….!?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>If so, that would be the worst! &nbsp;Artpe quickly turned to look at Maetel!</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Maetel]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Level : 174]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good. &nbsp;I worried for nothing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was still growing at a stable yet crazy speed!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You didn’t worry for nothing. &nbsp;It is rude to stare at another woman like that! &nbsp;Hurry up and apologize to her!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>For some reason, Maetel had raised her voice, and she berated Artpe! &nbsp;Both of her cheeks were puffed out, and she stamped towards him. &nbsp;She pulled Artpe towards her side, and she bowed towards Leseti.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m sorry. &nbsp;From now on, I won’t let him get close to you, Ms Leseti. &nbsp;You can be at ease now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uh. &nbsp;Mmm. Ooh-mmmm….. &nbsp;No, you don’t really have to go that far….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Never! &nbsp;I’ll make sure he never gets close to you! &nbsp;I’ll do it even if Ms. Leseti might get hurt a little bit in the process!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why me!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was her Berserk skill still activated!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed Maetel’s gaze was so frightening that Leseti hide behind Silpennon. &nbsp;She made him her shield. &nbsp;She was a true specimen of a knight protector.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop going off topic. Anyways, Artpe, some change is occurring over there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Silpennon was slowly getting a sense of who he should trust, and who he should ignore. &nbsp;He pointed towards the middle of the destroyed plaza of the Dungeon where a light was emanating. &nbsp;He called after Artpe when he saw it. &nbsp;Artpe had a good idea what Silpennon was feeling, so he smirked as he gave a reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dungeons are a place where one could plunder a lot of goods. &nbsp;This happens when one clears a floor of a Dungeon or when one does a perfect clear. &nbsp;The Dungeon Merchants, who has a contract with the Dungeons, will show up. &nbsp;Their goal is to obtain the goods.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is it a form of summoning magic? It really is an advanced form of magic.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>While they were conversing, the pillar of light faded away. &nbsp;A woman, who was pretty familiar to Artpe and Maetel, made her appearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hello, customers! &nbsp;It has only been couple days, yet we meet again!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kek. &nbsp;It’s this ajumma again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t like that ajumma…....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had smooth brown skin, and the humble clothes of a merchant couldn’t hide her bodacious body. &nbsp;Her silver hair shone as if it was emitting light on its own. &nbsp;Then there was her silver eyes. She had slightly elongated, yet sharp eyes. &nbsp;It was none other than the middleman of the Anywhere company, Mycenae.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I thought you would be bit more happy to see me. &nbsp;What kind of reaction is this? &nbsp;Even I would be hurt a little bit….. &nbsp;Huh? &nbsp;Your party has grown?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You really appeared….. &nbsp;&nbsp;Even the royal family would have a hard time believing such a ridiculous beauty exists, and you have long ears. &nbsp;Are you one of the fabled Elves?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hello, new customer. &nbsp;It is forbidden to inquire about the identity of a Dungeon merchant.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mycenae put on her business smile as she replied with a firm voice. &nbsp;Silpennon was a bit frightened by her, so he took couple steps back. &nbsp;At the same time, Artpe supplemented his words with an apathetic voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you can find out the information without your opponent finding out, it isn’t forbidden. &nbsp;Of course, if you are find out, you will be in big trouble like this ajumma.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Koohk. &nbsp;I failed again…..!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe effortlessly created a Mana String. &nbsp;He swung it, and it shattered the observation magic that was about to used secretly on Silpennon and Leseti. &nbsp;She mumbled to herself as she grinded her teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I never expected you to be able to sense and interfere with observation magic that wasn’t directed at you….. &nbsp;Still, I was able to learn more about your peerless ability, so I didn’t take a loss!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However, you’ll be taking a loss from now on. &nbsp;I want 30% discount.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ooh-goong. &nbsp;Ooh-oong--oohk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mycenae let out a moan that was difficult to decipher. &nbsp;At this point, it was fair to wonder if she enjoyed being taken advantage of by Artpe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as if Silpennon had passed a baton off to Mycenae. &nbsp;She looked as if she wanted to roll around on the floor. &nbsp;Artpe ignored Mycenae. &nbsp;He started looting the Huge Slime with Maetel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first thing he picked up was the precious Demite’s Gemstone. &nbsp;The Huge Slime’s ability was beyond expectation. &nbsp;One could see that some parts of the hard gem were melted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s see….. &nbsp;Oh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe poured water over it to wash away the slime. &nbsp;He had a satisfied expression as he looked at the Delmite’s Gemstone, which was letting out more light than before. &nbsp;He mumbled to himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If 50 more Huge Slimes shows up, I think I’ll be able to refine it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You want to create 50 more of this monster!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Unfortunately, it is impossible to do so, so don’t be frightened. &nbsp;It is rare to find an opportunity that allows one to easily level up like this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Easily…....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had also regurgitated all the treasures it ate coming down to this floor. &nbsp;It also produced Artifacts and gold coins when the Records and Mana of the Slime was consolidated. &nbsp;When Maetel saw one of the items, she let out a happy shout.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s a Skill Book!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Unfortunately, the two of us already learned that one.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Skill Book was called Mana Control. &nbsp;It was a Skill that could be learned after Mana Detection. &nbsp;It was a Skill everyone, who aspired to be a level 100 high rank Class, must learn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it was very difficult to learn it by oneself. &nbsp;It was hard even for those that were born with the potential for becoming a magician. &nbsp;Since the skill can’t be self-taught, one had to buy it with money. &nbsp;There were a lot of cases where people gave up on becoming a level 100 high rank Class, because they couldn’t acquire the book.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel had learned such a skill at level 2. &nbsp;It really highlighted how bad of a cheat her talent was. &nbsp;Nothing more had to be said about that subject.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since we already learned this Skill, we’ll merely increase our Mana by a little bit if we use it….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That wasn’t a bad option, but in many ways, it would be best to just sell the Skill Book. &nbsp;The demand for the Mana Control Skill was high, yet there was an absolute shortage in supply. &nbsp;It was the number one in demand amongst the high rank Skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Basically, it was expensive. &nbsp;It was very expensive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That is why at this point….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe looked at Silpennon, who was looking at him with an absent minded face. &nbsp;Artpe knew Silpennon had no knowledge of it, yet he asked in a sly manner. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you know what Mana Control is?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I knew it. &nbsp;You should listen carefully.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe grinned as he made a rough outline of the skill Silpennon had to learn. &nbsp;Artpe even ranked the order in which Silpennon had to learn it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, the first one on the list was Mana Control.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll tell you this beforehand, but I’m not lying.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are lying!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He said he’s not lying.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He isn’t lying, your highness. &nbsp;It is true that even I had to buy and learn Mana Control with money. &nbsp;Most people are weeded out at this point. &nbsp;Of course, I was only able to buy it easily, because I had the backing of the throne.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mycenae and Leseti intruded at the right time to back up Artpe’s words! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite their words, Silpennon graoned. &nbsp;He mulled over it before he shook his head from side to side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll learned Mana Control through my talent alone! &nbsp;I can do it! &nbsp;I’m someone that’ll go through with what I said!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All right. &nbsp;I’ll just sell this then. &nbsp;How much are you will to give me for this, ajumma?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I told you I’m not an ajumma! &nbsp;I’ll buy it for 300 gold. &nbsp;Of course, when I resell it, I’ll sell it for over 350 gold!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All right. &nbsp;I’m being generous. &nbsp;Three hundred gold will….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait a moment!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The retail price jumped 50 gold from the trade price. &nbsp;At that moment, Silpennon yelled out to halt the deal. &nbsp;Artpe and Mycenae grinned at the same time, and they turned to look at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why? &nbsp;Did you change your mind?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m in the middle of a negotiation. &nbsp;Could you not interfere, customer?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as if the the times when they growled at each other never existed. &nbsp;When they were trying to screw over someone else, the two of them worked in absolute harmony! &nbsp;Silpennon grinded his teeth as he yelled out his words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll kill you all someday! &nbsp;However, I’ll buy that! &nbsp;Since I am one of your party members, I expect a discount!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course. &nbsp;I’ll take your contributions into consideration, and I’ll give you a discount. &nbsp;I’ll sell it to you for cheap at the price of 260 gold.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe smiled as he handed over the Skill Book to Silpennon. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Silpennon took out gold coins from his Dimensional Pouch, and he let out a sigh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mycenae felt sympathy for him, but she knew Silpennon had sealed his defeat when he tried to go against Artpe’s design.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah. &nbsp;You do realize you have to switch your Class first right? &nbsp;If you are dumb enough to go into any great temple to do it, your identity will be revealed. &nbsp;You should do it by buying a consumable artifact.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So how much is that!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe gave a sign to Mycenae. &nbsp;She had already been anticipating this move. &nbsp;She didn’t want to lose out on a sales opportunity, so she quickly yelled out the price.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is 300 gold, customer!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ggoo-roo-ooh-ahhhhhhhk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the moment when the current Crown Prince took a step forward to become the future thief.</span></p>
