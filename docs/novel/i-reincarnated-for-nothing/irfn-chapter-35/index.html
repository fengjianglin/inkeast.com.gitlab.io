 <p>Chapter 35 - Come to Think of It, I'm a Hero (3)</p>
 <p><span style>The Obsidian of Greed was originally an item used to gather power of curses. &nbsp;It was an ingredient used when making a more powerful curse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was an item for magicians who dealt in curses, and it was something they desperately wanted. &nbsp;It was representative of magic stones that couldn’t be made artificially.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Moreover, this one is Rank A. &nbsp;It means it can store a lot of curses.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, there was an obvious limitation to this item. If an item or a Mana had the property of a curse, it would all be absorbed into the stone. &nbsp;However, it was hard to do anything significant when the curse was already active.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A curse wasn’t like placing a load on a person’s shoulder. &nbsp;A portion of a person’s skin, bones, muscles, brain and heart went through subtle changes. &nbsp;These changes permeated into one’s entire being, and the change would become inextricably linked to one’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was why if one was rash in extracting the cursed Mana, the innate Mana within the subject would go on a rampage before killing the subject.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If so…. &nbsp;Come, Aena. &nbsp;I’ll deal with you first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Y... yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, such limitations didn’t apply to Artpe, because he possessed a rare cheat ability called the Read All Creation ability!</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he concentrated, he could get a detailed information on the composition of plants or creatures. &nbsp;So how could extracting cursed Mana from affected regions be difficult for him!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This might hurt a little bit. &nbsp;Endure it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W...what? &nbsp;What did I do······.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Endure it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, hoohk!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe abruptly placed the Obsidian on Aena’s forehead. &nbsp;Afterwards, Aena’s body started to shake. &nbsp;The townspeople who had been watching this sight immediately stepped back in fright. &nbsp;Of course, Artpe didn’t pay any attention to them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I caught it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was able to pinpoint the part of her weak innate magical energy that was being dyed black with the energy of the curse. &nbsp;After a precise extraction, he spoke to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Still, your erodibility was very low, so you didn’t suffer as much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“E...erodibility······?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Aena was shaking from the pain as she asked him a question. &nbsp;She could immediately guess at what had happened, so her eyes opened wide.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes, she was sure her body hadn’t felt normal. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>If one felt fine when one was being changed into a monster through a curse, that person would be the incredible one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Monster...Modification Curse….? &nbsp;Then my dongsaeng and the other children of the town…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The children were rounded up by them, because of that reason. &nbsp;Of course, they are also the ones who placed the curse on you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eeeeeeeek.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The girl bit her lips in anger. &nbsp;A small smile appeared on Artpe’s lips when he saw this. &nbsp;Pain usually transferred into emotion. &nbsp;The curse had progressed to a mere 1%, yet for a brief moment when she raged…...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All right. &nbsp;You did very well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe stepped back when he saw a slightly darker light within the Obsidian. &nbsp;He checked her with his Read All Creation ability, and not an ounce of curse energy was left behind. &nbsp;Aena blinked her eyes in wonder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My body feels light. &nbsp;I thought I had merely been tired and hungry…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did the unrest in your emotions lessen?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“······yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe impishly asked the question when it seemed he already knew the answer. &nbsp;Aena slightly nodded her head in confirmation. &nbsp;The townspeople who had been behind her started to crowd forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W...will we change into monsters too, magician-nim?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m sorry, but could you perhaps heal us too…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When it came to their own well-being, they were quick to step forward. &nbsp;Artpe let out a bitter laugh as he shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You guys are fine. &nbsp;It seems the curse was placed on children, who hadn’t matured completely yet. &nbsp;So the problem is with your offsprings.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“T...then my daughter….!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Curse….. &nbsp;A curse!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’ll be fine if I’m able to find them quickly. &nbsp;You shouldn’t worry about them this early in the process.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had thought this was a simple matter of the soldiers capturing their sons and daughters. &nbsp;However, a Modification Curse had been placed on them! &nbsp;The complexion of the townspeople immediately darkened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were afraid of the sword carrying soldiers. &nbsp;However, they were more afraid of magic and curses. &nbsp;These were mysterious powers of unknown origin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What shall we do, magician-nim? &nbsp;We’ll do anything. &nbsp;If my child turns into a monster, I…….!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I beg of you! &nbsp;Please save my son!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were already very worried about their offsprings, but they found out there was a time limit to their rescue. &nbsp;The townspeople were agitated, and they went wild. &nbsp;If the soldiers were in front of them, they would have tried to rip them into pieces. &nbsp;Moreover, Maetel was also in a similar state of agitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go right now, Artpe! &nbsp;I don’t know where the children of this tow is right now, but I’m sure the bad guys will do the same thing at different locations!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is as you say. &nbsp;We don’t know where they are, so do you really want to search the entire region?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Still, we have to do something!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In truth, old stories and legends about heroes were rife with such scenarios.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Some town would fall into crisis, and the hero would try to solve a problem with the help of the townspeople. &nbsp;However, a tragedy occurred when time ran out, and the hero would receive a big emotional burden. &nbsp;However, the pain of this event would allow the hero to mature mentally.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However, we don’t need to mature mentally, so we can skip that step.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Heroes who busily ran around deserts and jungles, while crying or laughing, were old news to him. &nbsp;Artpe couldn’t afford to waste his mental and physical energy like that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was so fun about searching everywhere, because one didn’t know location where the Quest had to be carried out! &nbsp;He was a new breed of hero where he would finish the Quest as soon as he received it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everyone get out of my way.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. &nbsp;Yes, sir!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Several dozen Mana Threads turned into several hundred as they extended out from Artpe. &nbsp;In a flash, they exited the town to spread into the region.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hoo-oooh······.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe looked as if he was standing still while he had his eyes closed. &nbsp;However, even those that didn’t know anything about Mana could feel a pressure coming from this strange energy, and the townspeople were unable to move. &nbsp;Maetel, who had a decent idea on what was going on, let out a sigh of relief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you had such a simple solution, you should have told me in the first place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who said this was simple?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He took out a Mana potion bottle, and he drank it. &nbsp;He focused on his control as he grumbled to himself.. &nbsp;The several hundred Mana Threads were spreading in all directions, and the radius of the search increased steadily. &nbsp;It increase to 500 meters, 1 kilometers, 2 kilometers and so on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In his past life, he was level 350, so this would have been easy. &nbsp;However, it wasn’t easy at all right now! &nbsp;If it wasn’t for the Mana String spell that strengthened the Mana Thread to the extreme, it would have been impossible to attempt this move. &nbsp;He briefly had this thought when he learned it, but it was a very cheat-like spell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Wait a moment. &nbsp;I could probably overlay my spell similarly to what Maetel did last time with her techniques…...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wondered if his spell could be used in a more effective manner if he overlaid his perception skill on top of the Mana String.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe immediately put his theory into action, and of course, it came back as a resounding success. &nbsp;He wondered if he was stealing and using Maetel’s talent for such a trivial matter. &nbsp;He had been afraid…. &nbsp;However, if he was to be truthful about it, he was thankful for it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Five kilometer. &nbsp;Ten kilometer...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shall I lend you my Mana, Artpe?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You only have a modicum of Mana, so how.…..I found them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was about to grumble towards Maetel when Artpe’s eyes opened wide.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The townspeople looked at him with nervous eyes. &nbsp;Aena looked at him with trust, since he had freed her body from the curse. &nbsp;Maetel was ready to charge any opponents waiting for them…..</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe spoke to them in a solemn manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go create an epilogue.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The place was located at a hill that was pretty far from the town. &nbsp;In other words, it was a great place to run into a Dungeon in the wild.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In this world, there were exactly two types of Dungeons. &nbsp;The first type was the sleeping Dungeons that waited for a hero to find it. &nbsp;The other type were Dungeons made by being that opposed the heroes. &nbsp;These Dungeons contained dangerous traps, super secret information or secret tests. &nbsp;These were Dungeons that had to be hidden away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The common point of the two types of Dungeons was the fact that heroes eventually found it to loot their contents. &nbsp;The Dungeon in this hill would suffer the same fate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You guys don’t have to follow me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are helping us despite the dangers, so how can we stay behind…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You guys will get in the way, so just hide somewhere nearby. &nbsp;Of course, it isn’t my responsibility if you die in the process.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was an ex-Four Heavenly King turned hero, so he was remorseless. &nbsp;He firmly got rid of nuisances that would get in the way of the Quest beforehand!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The townspeople became afraid when they realized there might be other dangers nearby. &nbsp;However, they couldn’t run away while leaving their children behind. &nbsp;They firmly held to their edged tools they had brought from their homes. &nbsp;They stood their ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W...we will wait for you here. &nbsp;At the very least, we will greet our children from here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really? &nbsp;Aren’t you guys just scared by the fact that soldiers might attack your town again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I...it isn’t like that!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed he hit the mark. &nbsp;Artpe smirked as he tried to enter into the cave located at the middle of the hill…..</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to go with you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah. &nbsp;You again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Aena blocked their way. &nbsp;She held a branch in one hand. &nbsp;It was a weapon that even a goblin would have an easy time breaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The children will be afraid if only magician-nim’s party enters. The children need at least one familiar face.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It isn’t as if your words don’t have merit, but you…...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She would be perfect for the part of a supporting cast who died midway in the story. &nbsp;Usually, the hero would rage at her death, and the boost provided by the emotion would lead the hero into victory.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In truth, the girl’s words were raising so many death flags that the stench coming from the death energy was unbearable. &nbsp;It wouldn’t be strange if she fell dead right now! &nbsp;At the same time, it was also likely that she would come back out unharmed, since the circumstances was a bit suspicious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I beg of you, magician-nim. &nbsp;I know these children the best. &nbsp;They are already afraid from being kidnapped by the soldiers. &nbsp;If the magician-nim’s party encounter the children in such a state, a large mistake may occur…….!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had put a lot of thought into this. At this point, he couldn’t turn turn her down. &nbsp;From that moment on, Artpe decided to give up on Aena’s life. &nbsp;Yes, if she’s meant to die, she would find a way to die eventually!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All right. &nbsp;Your sacrifice will make it more likely that the children would be unharmed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why is my sacrifice the premise of the children being safe!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go, Maetel. &nbsp;I’ll leave the fighting to you. &nbsp;When I tell you to stop, you have to stop.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I understand!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The party consisting of the two heroes and the Village Girl A left behind the townspeople. &nbsp;They charged into the cave. &nbsp;There was a very dark and dreary energy circulating within the cave. &nbsp;A curse was mixed into the Dungeon’s air. &nbsp;To be precise, &nbsp;it was curse meant to propagate a different spell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You must be enjoying it since there are a lot to eat, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe took out the Obsidian, and it sucked in all the curses. &nbsp;He never expected to find such a treasure within the normal town A at this point in time. &nbsp;This was a loss for the Demon King’s army!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. &nbsp;As expected, I think Artpe would become a good father. &nbsp;Ooh-hue-hue.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel watched Artpe fill the Obsidian with the curse. &nbsp;She looked on with satisfaction as she mumbled to herself. &nbsp;Aena wondered if she could trust these heroes that acted very strangely starting from the Dungeon’s entrance. She had these thoughts, but she also didn’t have much choice. &nbsp;She followed behind them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they entered a little bit deeper into the cave, the enemies soon appeared. &nbsp;The soldiers they had seen from the town was mixed in with a batch of soldiers they had never seen before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The most important fact was that there was a magician wearing a hooded robe standing within their midst.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huht!? &nbsp;They are intruders. &nbsp;Intruders!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Be careful. &nbsp;He’s the mage I saw in town…..!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Magician? &nbsp;That brat is one?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed the soldiers didn’t feel any shame at being found out. &nbsp;They immediately got ready to attack. &nbsp;It meant they were fully aware of what they were doing, and they were prepared to kill to fulfill their goals.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this point, he was sure that there was a connection between the archduke, the black magician and the Demon King’s army. &nbsp;Artpe was about to step forward as he grinded his teeth, but Maetel took one step forward before he was able to.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are making children into monsters….. &nbsp;It’s bad.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel’s emerald colored eyes flashed from anger. &nbsp;Artpe realized she had already finished judging who was good and evil.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Anyways, we……..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the part where the hero and the villains confronted each other. &nbsp;The villains would lay out their twisted logic behind their actions as they mocked the hero.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The hero would become enraged, and they would fight. &nbsp;The bad guys liked to talk while fighting, so they would prattle on about the righteousness of their actions. &nbsp;They would try to justify their cause. &nbsp;The hero would get angry once again at their words. &nbsp;The Death Knight within the Dungeon meant to foster the heroes was a great example of this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Be quiet! &nbsp;Shut the hell up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the current situation was different. &nbsp;Maetel swung her bastard sword once before her enemies could pull their swords out or activate a spell. &nbsp;They all fell to the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She hadn’t activated her Berserk. &nbsp;She wasn’t even using her Strike skill. &nbsp;It was a light attack that possessed not a single ounce of Mana.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hoo-oooooh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were completely wiped out. &nbsp;They didn’t even have the time to give their lines. &nbsp;The mage wasn’t able to call out the Black Flame Dragon sealed within its right arm!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heeeek······.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Aena had depended on them, because she had seen the power of Artpe as a magician. &nbsp;However, when she saw the terrible sight created by Maetel, her face turned pale.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Maetel was the one who had created this terrible sight, yet it didn’t feel real to her. &nbsp;She tilted her head in confusion as she turned to speak to Artpe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They are too weak, Artpe.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe did a double take when he heard her words, but a smile soon broke out on his face. &nbsp;He nodded his head at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s all right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Usually, a normal hero’s first quest was accompanied by failure and hardships. &nbsp;However, they had unintentionally leveled up as much as they could in the kingdom of Diaz. &nbsp;In other words….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since we are progressing towards part 2, this is normal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Part 2?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel titled her head in puzzlement, but Artpe just smiled at her. &nbsp;While Aena was still in an utter state of confusion, the heroes went through the entire Dungeon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No one could get in their way.</span></p>
