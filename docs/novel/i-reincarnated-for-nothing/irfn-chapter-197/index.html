 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the record of a loser, so he didn’t think it deserved to be listened so attentively. &nbsp;However, his party members thought differently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Artpe······.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is that why you knew everything? &nbsp;You’ve already experienced it once before?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In our past lives, many things went in favor of the Demon King instead of the hero.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Artpe’s past life was the record of a loser, but at the same time, the hero’s party had lost too. &nbsp;It was also the record of their defeat. &nbsp;He added nothing and he concealed nothing as he told the events</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He told how the hero’s party was formed. &nbsp;Everything was different from their current life. &nbsp;The Demon King’s army had used a different strategy in attacking the human realm. &nbsp;The hero’s party couldn’t stop the corruption within Paladia. &nbsp;He told them about Vadinet’s love for Silpennon, and the destruction that arose from that love. &nbsp;He spoke about the hero’s relationship with the other human nations. &nbsp;He told them about the war, and the battle against Artpe…. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He told them about his demise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It really was a shit show.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, it was a shit show. &nbsp;I was the enemy of the human race, but even I could see how hopeless the humans could be as a race. &nbsp;That is the reason why I hid Maetel in the beginning. &nbsp; This is old news, but I’ll make a shocking confession. &nbsp;In truth, the meal that we’ve had up until now was better than the meal that would have been provided by the palace.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Artpe is a con artist.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Maetel laughed as she spoke mischievously. &nbsp;There was also a faint smile on Artpe’s lips. &nbsp;The fact that they were able to laugh together was quite amazing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s my story. &nbsp;I don’t have firsthand knowledge as to what happened to the world after I died.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I guess it’s my turn.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Silpennon took up the baton. &nbsp;He told them about his encounter with one of the former Four Heavenly King, and how he had recovered his memories. &nbsp;He told them about what had occurred up until the point of his death. &nbsp;He wondered if it would have better if he hadn't told this story. &nbsp;It was a miserable story. &nbsp;Still, everything became clear now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Basically, a secret boss has to be killed after defeating the Demon King. &nbsp;However, the secret boss was able to operate from the beginning when Artpe rewound the history of the world. &nbsp;Basically, that’s what happened.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We defeated most of our enemies, but the previous Demon King remains to be defeated. &nbsp;That still remain the same.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I see. &nbsp;That is why…..”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m still having a hard time accepting it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vadinet had a sour look on her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How could I like such a man as him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll fight you later on. &nbsp;I won’t go easy on you, because you are a woman.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It is such a mysterious feeling. &nbsp;I wonder what I was like in that world.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sienna absentmindedly thought about her other self in the previous world. &nbsp;In the end, she just nodded her head as she smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m thankful that oppa was born as a human. &nbsp;I don’t think I can imagine a life without you, oppa.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If it wasn’t for Artpe, the world would have ended.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Artpe just let out a bitter laughter when he saw Sienna and Maetel’s reaction. &nbsp;He had been a Four Heavenly King, and he had fought against Maetel, who had been the hero. &nbsp;Despite knowing all of this, their reaction was quite mild. &nbsp;It even made him question if he had been worried over nothing. &nbsp;Maybe, he was the weird one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m fine since I’m able to love Artpe-nim now. &nbsp;It is also fortunate that I avoided dying a dog’s death in this life.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Artpe, may I hit that woman once? &nbsp;Just once.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You should be quiet.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he came to his senses, he realized Maetel was already holding his hand. &nbsp;Maetel was smiling at him as if she had accepted everything. &nbsp;Artpe was about to say something, but he gave up. &nbsp;He thought it was no longer important. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is that it? &nbsp;Is that all you feel?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It is such a ridiculous story that I’m half in disbelief. &nbsp;Truthfully, even if the story is true, my attitude towards you won’t change.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Elrick had spoken up. &nbsp;As one of the male members of the party, he was able to give the most objective opinion. &nbsp;It was also the reason why Artpe could trust his words the most. &nbsp;In the corner of Artpe’s heart, there had always been a tight ball of worry, and he finally felt it loosen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If I heard that story before I met Artpe-nim, I might have a different opinion. &nbsp;However, aren’t we trying to return the Demon realm into a human realm right now? &nbsp;If so, can’t we just say that you were the first Demon to be turned back into human? &nbsp;That is also the reason why you were given the power of the magic tome. &nbsp;If I think of it that way, I can accept it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Uh······?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vadinet was completely in love with Artpe, so Artpe had expected her to spout some nonsense that would be in favor of Artpe. &nbsp;However, her words were pretty compelling. &nbsp;When he heard her words, an idea flashed in his mind. &nbsp;However, it went away quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was one sure thing that had come out of this. &nbsp;The scenario that Artpe had been most worried about hadn’t come to pass. &nbsp;Emotions washed over him. &nbsp;He didn’t know if it was a sense of shame or relief. &nbsp;He just swept away all those emotions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I feel like an idiot for suffering under the weight of this burden for so long. &nbsp;Thank you for sharing your opinions.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The fact that Artpe-nim is capable of suffering is more surprising to me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Shut up, ajumma.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m not an ajumma!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was grumbling, but he would be lying if he said that he wasn’t deeply moved by all their words. &nbsp;His inner limit on how much embarrassment he could stand was surpassed. &nbsp;He immediately laid down on the floor, and he pushed his hood down over his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m just saying. &nbsp;I thought you guys would be less upset hearing it from me rather than hearing it from the previous Demon King. &nbsp;It wasn’t as if I thought your attitudes would change. &nbsp;It wasn’t as if I didn’t trust you all. &nbsp;I just want you guys to know this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Artpe-nim has a really cute side.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Shut up.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“······shocked.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Regina’s emotions were the most difficult to assess compared to the others. &nbsp;She was the last one to open her mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Artpe was older than me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I wondered why you weren’t saying anything about it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m younger than you physically and mentally. &nbsp;I’m in a very dangerous situation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You are extremely safe. &nbsp;Extremely.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“All your odd actions in the past makes sense now. &nbsp; From now on, I’ll consider it a potential risk factor.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Artpe wondered if he should play along with her. &nbsp;However, he gave up on that idea. &nbsp;He didn’t need his relationship with women to get more complicated right now. &nbsp;Regina was a bit miffed when he didn’t play along. &nbsp;She kept poking him with her staff, yet he ignored her until the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘I have to stop her from talking about me liking younger women…...’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He thought about saying something, but in the end, Artpe just fell asleep.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In truth, he had been the one that had been the most overextended in the battle against the Demon King and the Fragment of the Demonic god. &nbsp;Of course, he was the moe tired than anyone in his party. &nbsp;He had told them everything about his previous life, and the fact that he had not collapsed afterwards from exhaustion was a miracle in itself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Artpe fell asleep.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmmm.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Maetel quickly moved to snipe the position beside Artpe. &nbsp;Sienna was as quick as Maetel. &nbsp;She positioned herself on the other side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s sleep too.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You guys really have excellent timing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Artpe doesn’t yield it up to us, so we have no choice but to take it from him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“However, I now have some idea as to why he’s like that.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Maetel and Sienna guarded his sides. &nbsp;Vadinet pushed through the narrow space to position herself near Artpe’s head. Artpe had fallen asleep, and he had a peaceful expression on his face. &nbsp;Vadinet was very careful as she put his head on her thighs, and she gently touched his hair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m sure this is why Artpe-nim has been so hesitant. &nbsp;He inwardly felt that he was a different person from what we viewed him as. &nbsp;That is why he wasn’t confident in being able to accept our feelings at face value.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Normally, you sound like an ignoramus. &nbsp;You sounded somewhat like a holy priestess right now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Shut up.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Vadinet sounded sullen when she gave her retort. &nbsp;However, the smile on her lips didn’t fade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I now know why he’s been holding back. &nbsp;Now I can be at ease. &nbsp;I can pursue him for real.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You haven’t been pursuing him for real until now!?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her &nbsp;words were more surprising than the story told by Artpe today! &nbsp;Vadinet looked at her competitors with guarded eyes, but she remained in place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You plan on staying like that all night?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I will do so if Artpe-nim can rest in comfort. &nbsp;It is as Artpe-nim had said…. &nbsp;Tomorrow will be a long day.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was as if her words drained them of energy. &nbsp;The whole party came to a consensus without speaking a single word. &nbsp;They all sprawled out on the floor. &nbsp;They were all tired. &nbsp;For the next several hours, no one was bothered them. &nbsp;They were greeted by peace and silence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Artpe awoke the next day, and he felt unusually refreshed. &nbsp;He thought he had been lying on the floor, but his head was being supported by something soft and warm. &nbsp;He felt around, and he realized that he was touching someone’s thighs. &nbsp;He became more surprised when he found out that the owner of the thighs was Vadinet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite having Artpe’s head on her thighs, she didn’t look uncomfortable. &nbsp;Sse was sleeping with a faint smile on her face. &nbsp;It bothered him that this was the most brightest and pure smile he had seen on her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘Why is she doing this? &nbsp;Until now, she never initiated contact until I gave her permission.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He wondered if he had been worried about the wrong thing. &nbsp;After telling them his story yesterday, he wondered if he had called forth trouble from an entirely different direction. &nbsp;He had been worried about them rejecting him, but this change was worrying too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Artpe let out a bitter laughter as he tried to get up. &nbsp;However, he couldn't’ move his body. &nbsp;Maetel and Sienna was stuck to his sides. &nbsp;Etna and Mycenae was holding onto his thighs. &nbsp;It was as if someone had casted an Immobility spell on him. &nbsp;He couldn’t move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Dangerous man.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Regina was observing it all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“······do something. &nbsp;Don’t just stand there looking at me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The act of approaching you is dangerous. &nbsp;It is more beneficial to observe the pattern where the bugs fall into a trap.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright. &nbsp;I’m sorry for ignoring you yesterday. &nbsp;I fell asleep. &nbsp;It couldn’t be helped.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“······accepted”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Regina pouted as she swung her staff. &nbsp;She slowly separated the girls from him. &nbsp;He sat up, and he found out that everyone was still sound asleep.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is it ok not to wake them up? &nbsp;I would like to hasten the humanification of the Demon realm. &nbsp;The faster it is done the better it would be.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It is more important for our party members to regain their normal physical and mental status. &nbsp;If we exit this place, we won’t be able to rest for awhile.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“······agreed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Regina quietly nodded her head as she approached him. &nbsp;She sat down next to him. &nbsp;He wondered why she was doing this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She spoke with a sincere voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I want to hear about my past life. &nbsp;I want the details. &nbsp;I want to hear how you came to know about me in my past life.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It isn’t a happy story. &nbsp;Are you sure?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If I want to be happy in the future, I have to go through with this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a wise answer to a stupid question. &nbsp;Artpe smirked as he opened his mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ok. &nbsp;I'll tell you about it. &nbsp;Still, I hope you won’t hate the humans too much after hearing this story.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Even if some of the humans did me wrong, I won’t be incredibly foolish in hating the whole human race. &nbsp;You are worrying over nothing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, you really are like that. &nbsp;Jeez.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even in her past life, Regina had stuck with Maetel until the end as a member of the hero’s party. &nbsp;Maybe, he had been worrying needlessly. &nbsp;Artpe nodded his head at her words, and he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In my past life, the incident between the Elves and the Magic Kingdom turned out much nastier…..”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The conversation between the two of them ended when the other party members started to wake up. &nbsp;Regina had taken a step back yesterday, so the girls were shocked when they saw her next to Artpe. &nbsp;They never expected her to use such a high level tactic. &nbsp;Regina stood her ground with an impassive face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was how Artpe had revealed all the story he had kept hidden. &nbsp;He didn’t leave any loose ends behind that could cause any confusions in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The hero’s party headed towards the final battlefield. &nbsp;</span></p>
