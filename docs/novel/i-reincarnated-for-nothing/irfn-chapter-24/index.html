 <p>Chapter 24 - Yesterday's Enemy (3)</p>
 <p><span style>In his past life, the hero had been born within the Diaz Kingdom. &nbsp;When the hero turned 12 years old, she was dragged straight into the palace. &nbsp;This was the biggest mistake that had occurred in the past hero’s life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The palace followed a Hero Support Manual that was created several hundred years ago. &nbsp;While she was reared with the utmost care, the hero’s first party member was added during this time. &nbsp;He was none other than this country’s crown prince Silpennon Le Diaz. &nbsp;He was a thief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Of course, it isn’t my business as to why Silpennon had turned down his seat as the crown prince to join the hero’s party….. &nbsp;No, I get it now.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was true that Silpennon was directing his words towards Artpe, but his eyes remained planted on Maetel. &nbsp;His cheeks were red. &nbsp;It seemed he had fallen for her on first sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was understandable. &nbsp;In her past life, Maetel could have easily ruined couple kingdoms with her beauty. &nbsp;She was only thirteen years old right now, but her budding beauty could be seen even now. &nbsp;This was why it wasn’t far-fetched to think that the crown prince had fallen for her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, Silpennon had witnessed Maetel shed blood with his two eyes. &nbsp;It was a bit baffling that he was able to show such pure ardor towards her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don't want your answer. &nbsp;I want to hear it from the girl!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Silpennon browbeat Artpe as he turned his intense gaze towards Maetel. &nbsp;Artpe shrugged his shoulders, and he lightly tapped Maetel’s shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“....if you put it that way, I have no choice. &nbsp;You do whatever you want, Maetel.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel’s tears hadn’t stopped yet, but she was released from Artpe’s embrace. &nbsp;She faced the crown prince. &nbsp;The crown prince looked on with pity when he saw her puffy eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You poor thing….. &nbsp;You are a child with a very tender heart. &nbsp;However, you don’t have to be worried. &nbsp;The people you killed right now are rebels. &nbsp;They are traitors to this country, so you don’t have to be wounded by their deaths…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I hate the palace! &nbsp;I’m not going!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Silpennon’s attempt at consoling her failed miserably. &nbsp;Maetel cut him off as she rejected him. &nbsp;She returned to the arms of Artpe. &nbsp;She was as resolute as Artpe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What the…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Silpennon was turned down in no uncertain term, so he froze in place. &nbsp;One of the knights protecting Silpennon inadvertently started breaking out in laughter. &nbsp;The other knights reigned him in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Silpennon came to his senses under the impetus of the laughter. &nbsp;He had never been turned down so firmly in his life. &nbsp;His pride took a big hit, and he started talking incoherently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W...why not…. &nbsp;I promise to give you a lot of things! &nbsp;If you help me, I… &nbsp;Y...yes. &nbsp;What is your name? &nbsp;Which family are you from? &nbsp;If you have to travel around with such a terrible servant, it seems to indicates that you are unfortunately not from a suitable family. &nbsp;However, when we return to the palace, I’ll use all the power at my disposal to elevate you to a suitable position….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“....did you just insult Artpe right now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She didn’t like something Silpennon had said. &nbsp;Maetel remained in Artpe’s embrace, but she extracted her face to glare at Silpennon. &nbsp;Silpennon realized he had stepped on a mine, so his face turned pale.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah. &nbsp;I...I didn’t mean it like that….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I just told you! &nbsp;Artpe isn’t terrible, and he isn’t my servant!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“H...he isn’t your servant!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are really terrible!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It really was a sight that couldn’t be seen without shedding some tears. &nbsp;It seemed Artpe wasn’t the only one having such thoughts. &nbsp;The female knight, who had initiated a conversation with Artpe, carefully spoke to Silpennon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your highness. &nbsp;Unfortunately, we might have to give up on the idea of them helping us. &nbsp;They have already saved your highness’ life once. &nbsp;You should be thankful, yet you are trying to detain them against their will. &nbsp;This isn’t unbefitting of your station, your highness. &nbsp;You possess the great bloodline of Diaz.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Koo-oohk…. &nbsp;&nbsp;So I have no choice, but to let the girl go!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your highness…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were playing their parts well. &nbsp;They continued to act as if they were still in charge of a kingdom. &nbsp;If so, they could do as they wished by themselves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She doesn’t want to do it. &nbsp;Are we done here? &nbsp;We’re going.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmph!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe let out a sigh as he turned away from them. &nbsp;As if she was worried about being left behind, she matched his footsteps. &nbsp;At that moment, she was very cute.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please stop…...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Silpennon called after them again. &nbsp;His voice drooped like a wet rag. &nbsp;Artpe didn’t hide his annoyance as he turned around. &nbsp;However, his eyes opened slightly wider when he saw what was in Silpennon’s hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please take this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What the….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was Artpe’s turn to be surprised like an idiot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Silpennon had held up a large jewel that was emitting a purple light from all its surface. &nbsp;Anyone, who knew the identity of the precious gemstone, would have reacted in a similar fashion. &nbsp;Artpe’s Read All Creation ability didn’t let him down. &nbsp;It immediately displayed the item’s info.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Demite’s Gemstone]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Magician]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[It is part of the Limite group, which is considered to be the one of the highest ranked ingredients for magic items. &nbsp;It is incredibly high in purity, and as time passed, it gained a Class of its own. &nbsp;It is a legendary gem that only appears a handful of times in either the human world or the demon world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It hadn’t been refined yet, so the gemstone’s enormous power is still hidden. &nbsp;However, once it is refined, it will increase one’s Mana by a vast amount, and it would also develop random additional abilities. &nbsp;It will also develop a will of its own, so it will have the ability to help the owner finish one’s spell. &nbsp;However, it is so hard that it is almost impossible to refine it. &nbsp;This is the only flaw to the item.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is probably worth more than his entire kingdom!?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had run across an unexpected item at a place where he had never expected to find it. &nbsp;This was why Artpe almost became lost in himself. &nbsp;Silpennon spoke calmly in front of Artpe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since I’ve incurred a debt to you, it is up to me to express my thanks. &nbsp;I am being chased, but I cannot neglect my duty. &nbsp;Take this, youth. &nbsp;I don’t know what it is, but it has been kept in our kingdom’s treasury for a very long time. &nbsp;I’m sure it is a precious gemstone. &nbsp;You should sell this, so your master… &nbsp;No. &nbsp;I want you to use it to help the girl acquire equipment that would be of help to her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you really know what this is….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>No, if he knew, he wouldn’t have given it to Artpe no matter how great of a help they were to him. &nbsp;Artpe cleanly swallowed the shout of joy that was about to exit his mouth. &nbsp;He took the purple colored gemstone. &nbsp;In such a situation, it was one’s duty to be quiet, and just take the item!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm. &nbsp;As expected of the crown prince, you’ve received a fantastic upbringing. &nbsp;Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that perhaps a compliment, Artpe!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other knights were taken aback when they saw Silpennon hand over the Demite Gemstone. &nbsp;&nbsp;It seemed all the other knights weren’t like the female knight, who convinced Silpennon to do the right thing. &nbsp;It seemed they didn’t put much importance in duty and honor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your highness, we took that before we ran away from the palace. &nbsp;I don’t think you should give away such a precious treasure…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is too excessive. &nbsp;I can tell at a glance that they aren’t highborn. &nbsp;We can’t give our treasure just because they aided us with the sword once….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“His highness has made his decision, so you should all shut up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone shut their mouth when the female knight gave a fiery order. &nbsp;She was level 118. &nbsp;Since she had the highest level amongst the knights, he had wondered if she was the leader. &nbsp;He had guessed right.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Well, even if she was the leader, they were…. &nbsp;Artpe shrugged his shoulders, and he put away the Demite’s Gemstone into the Dimensional Pouch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The knights kept looking back at Artpe as if Silpennon’s actions had left much to be desired. &nbsp;The female knight spoke in praise about the crown prince’s upbringing. &nbsp;Silpennon tried to act cool on the outside, but the crown prince couldn’t let go of the lingering attachment he had towards Maetel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm…...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe hesitated as he looked at them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t like Silpennon, but this sentiment came from the fact that Silpennon had delivered the killing blow in his past life. &nbsp;However, the one in front of him showed some promise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No, if he thought about it, Silpennon had carried out the dirty deed instead of the hero. &nbsp;He wasn’t really that bad of a guy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every time he saw Silpennon he remembered the calm face of the bastard, who stuck a dagger into his heart in his past life. &nbsp;It annoyed him, but when he saw the Demite’s Gemstone in his hand, any trauma he would have felt evaporated in moments.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘All right. &nbsp;It feel like a waste to just send them off like this.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was why he decided to give Silpennon a bonus.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Could you wait a little bit?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? &nbsp;Are you perhaps going to help us.....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you have any paper?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Paper?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The female knight tilted her head in confusion. &nbsp;She took out a piece of parchment from within her clothes. &nbsp;She handed it over to Artpe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All right…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He opened up the parchment, and he emitted a very small amount of Mana at the tip of his finger. &nbsp;Small smoke started to rise up as he wrote his letter. &nbsp;It was a trick that can be performed only by those adept at controlling Mana. &nbsp;Everyone except Maetel flinched when they saw this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As expected, this youth isn’t normal either, your highness...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If he is her assistant…. &nbsp;At the very least, he should have that much skill if he wants to travel with her. &nbsp;He’s a magician.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, I'm done writing. &nbsp;Also….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe took out an envelope from his Dimensional Pouch. &nbsp;It contained a strange green powder. &nbsp;He folded the note, and he handed it to the female knight with the envelope containing the green powder. &nbsp;He gave her a light wink.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is only for your eyes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W...what....”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The female knight’s face turned red. &nbsp;Silpennon and the knights focused their gazes on her. &nbsp;The female knight was flustered, but she quickly hid the items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A...are you trying to make fun of an adult!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was sincere. &nbsp;It is only for your eyes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Koohk…...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe was well aware of the fact that his appearance was quite pleasing. If not, a big fish like the leader of the thieves’ army Etna Carlyfate Mirecard wouldn’t have clung to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, love didn’t develop just based on a person’s appearance. &nbsp;However, one’s appearance was the first impression one could give, and it was undeniable that it had an immense effect on various parts of the love that develops.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Silpennon was stunned as he looked up at her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Leseti... &nbsp;Really?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah. &nbsp;No way, your highness! &nbsp;He’s just a young lad!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However, your face turned red.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It isn’t like that! &nbsp;Anyways, I have to check if the note and the powder is safe. &nbsp;I’ll keep it in my possession until then!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ll be leaving now. &nbsp;I hope you live long enough for us to meet again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe chortled as he turned away. &nbsp;He had done all he could for them, so it was up to them now. &nbsp;The night was getting deep, so they should return to their own campfire to get ready for camping outside...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Artpe…...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel’s eyes were murky like the eyes of a dead fish. &nbsp;She asked a question with a voice that was colder than winds blowing within the icy depths of hell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Does Artpe perhaps like old women….?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No. &nbsp;Nope. &nbsp;I promise you that isn’t the case.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had also fallen for the ruse!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe let out a sigh as he flicked her forehead. &nbsp;He dragged her towards the campfire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other side, the crown prince’s party stood in place for a moment. &nbsp;Everyone was looking towards one person. &nbsp;When the female knight became the focus of their attention, Leseti was flustered. &nbsp;She kept waving her arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I...it isn’t like that! &nbsp;It isn’t, your highness! &nbsp;Anyways, we should ready our camp. &nbsp;Since we don’t know how long our pursuers will follow us, we can’t rest long…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, we should rest, and you should read the letter.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is probably nothing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leseti erased the traces of battle, and she led the crown prince’s party towards a suitable campsite. &nbsp;She ordered the knights to make a shelter, so Silpennon could rest first. &nbsp;When no one was looking, she secretly took out Artpe’s letter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That impertinent brat…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed he had good eyes to be able to recognize a beauty like her. &nbsp;Leseti let out a self-satisfied smile as she lit a candle. &nbsp;His penmanship was so elegant that it was hard to believe a young man had written it. &nbsp;However, the letter was stuck to her eyes starting from the first word.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[All the other knights are traitors. &nbsp;It is up to you to protect the crown prince before he gets killed or kidnapped by them. &nbsp;They were probably waiting the right time to steal the jewel from the crown prince, but he gave it to me. &nbsp;They won’t hesitate anymore. &nbsp;Ah. &nbsp;I've enclosed a poison within the folded envelope. &nbsp;You should use it. &nbsp;This makes us even.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>…..the content of the letter had gone in a completely different direction than what Leseti had expected. &nbsp;The letter still made her heart pound.</span></p>
