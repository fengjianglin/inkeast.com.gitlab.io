 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The surrounding was deadly quiet. In an instant, a level 400 plus high ranked Demon was killed. &nbsp; Of course, the reaction to such an event wouldn’t be minor. &nbsp;The Demons, who were under the command of the dead Demon, came to a halt in fright. &nbsp;In the end, they were turned into humans by the power of the magic circle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[My power is decreasing.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[It isn’t just our power. &nbsp;The aggression that we use to violently attack our enemies can’t be felt. That bastard is trying to shackle us by turning us into humans!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Shackle? &nbsp;You guys have been wearing a mask up until now. &nbsp;Why can’t you see that I’m just taking that mask off?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When a firm idea took root within him, Artpe no longer hesitated over his actions. &nbsp;He didn’t agonize over what he had to do. &nbsp; The Reclamation magic existed to turn everything back into its original form. &nbsp;This wasn’t Artpe’s will. &nbsp;It was the will of the world, so there was no way this spell would be defeated!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Can it be…..]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The low voice of an old man could be heard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[I never expected someone to complete that spell…..]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He has overwhelming Demonic energy. &nbsp;Regina! &nbsp;Etna!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We are ready.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This Demonic energy…..?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He let the staff use the Reclamation magic. &nbsp;He had done this before when he fought against the arm of the Demonic god. &nbsp;This allowed Artpe to participate in the battle. &nbsp;Of course, the Reclamation magic expanded at a slower rate as a result! &nbsp; This was why he wanted his party to take care of the fighting, but….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wait a moment.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he induced the staff and the magic tome to resonate, he was able to gain momentary freedom. &nbsp;He put his Mana into the hand of destruction, and in a flash, it grew in size. &nbsp;It regained its original size. &nbsp;When Artpe relayed his will to it, it spread its fingers, and it created an enormous barrier. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Afterwards, the Baptism of the Demonic Spear impacted on the middle of the barrier!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The hand did well in blocking it, and it destroyed the spear. &nbsp;In the process, Artpe was able to assess his opponent. &nbsp;He scrunched up his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I knew it didn’t make sense. &nbsp;I should have known it would turn out like this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[What is that hand? &nbsp;A life form such as this exists in this world? &nbsp;No. &nbsp;I asked the wrong question. &nbsp;It is type of golem made through magic! &nbsp;Interesting. &nbsp; A mere golem was able to block my attack. &nbsp;How is that possible? &nbsp;However, it won’t be able withstand my next attack. &nbsp;I already figured out the golem’s special characteristic!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Artpe, he’s annoying.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don't worry. &nbsp;I feel the same way.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The second attack came flying in. &nbsp;First, the enemy manifested a magical net to restrict the movement of the hand of destruction. &nbsp;Then he followed up with a barrage of powerful magic bombs. &nbsp;It was supposed to destroy the hand, but of course, the hand of destruction completely extinguished the attack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[What······!?]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is odd. &nbsp;It is the first time I’ve heard this voice, but his manner of speech is quite familiar…...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It is also annoying.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Artpe’s party members felt a weird sense of de ja vu as they raised their weapons. &nbsp;Artpe knew they were in a desperate situation, yet the couldn’t suppress his laughter. &nbsp;His Read All Creation ability had already picked up on the presence of his enemy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Maybe, the Demon was confident no one could pierce through his stealth magic. &nbsp;He continued to be in a defenseless position. &nbsp;Of course, his stealth magic was so great that it couldn’t be penetrated unless one had the Read All Creation ability…..</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Etna.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Yes, he really is annoying in my opinion.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Etna was sharing his Read All Creation ability, so she caught sight of the enemy. &nbsp;He was making every effort to destroy the hand of destruction with his magic, but the hand was blocking all his attempts. &nbsp;She could see that he was growing angry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[We have to give up on the idea that we can kill him outright. &nbsp;Before he picks up on it, we have to focus on dealing as much damage to his body. &nbsp;He is a master that knows our magic better than anyone else.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[How do you know this….? &nbsp;Never mind. &nbsp;I understand. &nbsp;I have to minimize my use of my magic, and I have to deal a fatal blow?]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, their foe was too far for him to leave the battle to the close range fighters of his party. &nbsp;Unfortunately, Mycenae was still lacking in terms of damage when it came to single burst attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was why the task fell onto Etna. &nbsp;Etna was the only one in the party that dealt with magic that wasn’t truly magic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Alright. &nbsp;I’ll show you how it is done.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Etna activated her Innate ability. &nbsp;If it was a simple spell, it would have been detected by her opponent. &nbsp;However, her Innate ability was Spirit Transformation. &nbsp;It was an ability that hadn’t existed hundreds of years ago when the previous Demon King and the previous hero had run amok.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“At the very least, I’ll take one arm!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Koo-huhk?]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was why the Demon Nanarai Bodra couldn’t respond to the suddenly surging white flame. &nbsp;Etna had transformed into a Fire Spirit. &nbsp;As soon as he saw her, he immediately created a barrier. &nbsp;However, Etna had kept her words. &nbsp;She had already burned away his entire arm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Koohk, koo-ha-ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He hadn’t felt pain for a very long time. &nbsp;The Demon screamed as he grabbed his shoulder. &nbsp;Artpe spoke as he watched the face, which had been distorted by pain. &nbsp;There was a cold smile on his lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I believe this is the first time we’ve met directly, sunbae-nim.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sunbae-nim······? &nbsp;Huh?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The rest of the party finally realized what had caused that sense of incongruity. &nbsp;From the moment he had appeared, the Demon had spoken like a know it all asshole. &nbsp;He was Nanarai Bodra. &nbsp;He was the previous hero that had periodically helped Artpe’s party by leaving behind vestiges of his legacy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was distinct pattern to his Demonic energy, and he had overwhelming power. &nbsp;He also possessed an overwhelming presence and level. &nbsp;He had reached an absurdly high level of 403.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finally, the name that was being shown through Artpe’s eyes proved his identity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why······?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why is he attacking us? &nbsp;Does he have dementia? &nbsp;Does he not know that we are heroes?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No, he knows it. ”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Artpe looked at the enraged Demon, who was pointing his remaining arm towards them.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[A party of two heroes…. &nbsp;It is quite the familiar sight. &nbsp;It also makes me yearn for the good old days. &nbsp;I also fought for the humans once.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Artpe let out a bitter laughter as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It isn’t too late to return to our side.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[It is too late, young hero. &nbsp;My juniors…. &nbsp; Do you know about the weight of time? &nbsp;Do you know about the weight of death? I’ve spent too long a time as a Demon, and I am too used to it now. &nbsp;The Demonic energy stole many things from me, but as a price, it breathed in new desires within me.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the old former hero’s words, Artpe snorted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You and your party had enough power to kill the previous Demon King. &nbsp;Despite that fact, you chose to seal the previous Demon King. &nbsp;Am I wrong?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[No. &nbsp;At the time, our party didn’t have the power to kill the Demon King. &nbsp;We could only seal the Demon King.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You might have been able to convince your party members, but your lies won’t work on me. &nbsp;I know that your ability is more geared towards attacking rather than sealing. &nbsp;Why did you do it? &nbsp;You don’t like using your sealing ability since it is mundane. &nbsp;You prefer to use flashy attacks. &nbsp;Am I right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Artpe approached it from an angle that was unimaginable to a normal person. &nbsp;Nanaria Bodra flinched at Artpe’s words, and he took a step backwards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[H….how did you know….]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah. &nbsp;This asshole is an idiot.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I see. &nbsp;He really is an idiot.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Artpe didn’t give him time to respond. &nbsp;He pushed ahead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[I wondered why you sealed the Demon King instead of killing him. &nbsp;The reason was quite simple. &nbsp;At that point, you were already drawn towards the Demonic energy. &nbsp;You were drawn towards becoming a Demon. &nbsp;You said you turned yourself into a Demon, and that it was for research. &nbsp;You planned on searching for a way to turn the Demonic energy back into Mana. &nbsp;However, you were merely trying to make an excuse. &nbsp;You tricked yourself into accepting your true nature.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[······.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was silent for a brief moment before he opened his mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[It is truly a great deductive reasoning. &nbsp;Unfortunately, you are wrong, my junior.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m wrong?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His eyes let out a bright light. &nbsp;Demonic energy overflowed as it strengthened his old body. &nbsp;If Etna hadn’t destroyed one arm, he might have been able to push the hero’s party. &nbsp;That was how fierce his power was! &nbsp;As he raised his fighting spirit, he yelled out!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[The reason why I sealed her is simple. &nbsp;I was in love with her! &nbsp;I sealed her, and I dedicated my whole life in finding a way to revert her back into being a human. &nbsp;I was able to meet her again when the world was rewound. &nbsp;My way of thinking had been wrong from the start. &nbsp;The ones that were in the right were the Demons!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“······.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Artpe was struck dumb. &nbsp;He quietly nodded his head. &nbsp;The previous Demon King was a woman. &nbsp;It was a good information to know.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The story he had heard from the Elven elders from the Forest of Eternity came to mind. &nbsp;The previous hero had hit on many Elven women, so this explanation was very direct. &nbsp;Maybe, that story was foreshadowing this moment. &nbsp;It was an entirely believable explanation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He’s an idiot that can’t be cured.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, let’s kill him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone was in agreement. &nbsp;Nanarai Bodra was Maetel’s ancestor, and at the same time, he had a big influence in allowing Artpe’s party to grow so much. &nbsp;This was why they had decided to listen to his story a little bit more. &nbsp;However, they had found out that Nanarai Bodra didn’t know his ass from his forehead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, Artpe suspected this when Nanarai Bodra had shown up as an ally to the previous Demon King. &nbsp;It seemed he had lost a significant portion of his memories throughout the long years. &nbsp;If he hadn’t, he would have know about the power of the ruins he had created. &nbsp;He would have recovered the three Evil Hearts that he had put in safekeeping.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘He is unstable.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The magic that turned humans into Demons wasn’t complete. &nbsp;This was quite evident. &nbsp;If it was complete, the previous Demon King’s faction wouldn’t be having such a difficult time turning humans into Demon after being released from their seal. &nbsp;This also applied to Nanarai Bodra.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[I realized what the correct path was. &nbsp;Demonic energy isn't a twisted form of Mana. &nbsp;It is an evolved form of Mana, and it is the future we should strive for. &nbsp;I’ve been rejecting the existence of Demons all my life. &nbsp;She fixed my way of thinking. &nbsp;The existence of the Demonic god gives legitimacy to the Demonic energy. &nbsp;It is superior to Mana!]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The bastard was completely twisted in the mind. &nbsp;At the very least, he had wanted to pay his respects to his sunbae, who had walked a much higher road in magic. &nbsp;However, that ship had sailed. &nbsp;Nanarai Bodra didn’t care about the Demonic energy or Mana. &nbsp;He only cared about power and fear. &nbsp;Once he started worshipping the Demonic god, his career as a mage had come to an end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Artpe was cold as he gave his orders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Etna, you’ll be the main one to attack. &nbsp;I’ll focus on weakening them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What about me, Artpe?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You can take on the remaining group. Regina, may you protect the party?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Artpe didn’t need to say anything further. &nbsp;They knew what to do. &nbsp;The party’s expression hardened all at once. &nbsp;Sine Nanarai Bodra had come out, there was only one person left that had yet to make an appearance!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[You are a quite the sensible kid. &nbsp;You are different from the previous hero. &nbsp;Moreover, you are cute.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A slightly sweet voice could be heard from somewhere. &nbsp;Nanarai Bodra’s face glowed as he looked up. &nbsp;Artpe gritted his teeth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“······if you lay your hands on Artpe, I’ll kill you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No, she just threw those words out there instead of greeting us. &nbsp;Don’t be baited by her, Maetel”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">[Hoo hoo. &nbsp;As expected, this is fun. &nbsp;The twisted hero and the two heroes…. &nbsp;This is the best stage that I can offer him.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Artpe let lout a low sigh as he raised his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He saw a blindingly beautiful woman with black hair. &nbsp;The previous Demon King made her appearance.</span></p>
