<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Chapter 11 - Growth of the Heroes (3)</p>
 <p><span style>Record Link.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was classified as an ancient magic. &nbsp;It was a great magic that was representative of spells that were very troublesome to activate and maintain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If one wanted to activate this magic, one needed souls and bodies that had similar mana pattern, skills and special characteristics. &nbsp;The resonance created allowed them to easily identify each other’s intent. &nbsp;Moreover, if one of them died, all the power within its soul and body would be transferred to the others through the link.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In theory, if one killed the parts linked to the whole, the overall capability of the group would remain the same.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Up to this point, it sounded as if it was a technique that would allow one to create the strongest organization in this continent. &nbsp;However, the prerequisite of finding beings that were similar in mana pattern, techniques and special characteristics was fiendishly hard. &nbsp;In truth, no one was able to activate such magic throughout history.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if one was successful in activating it, there would be a horrific penalty if the will of one was slightly out out of sync with the others. &nbsp;It would cancel the magic spell, and the horrible side effects would be shared by all. &nbsp;This was why this spell was designated as a forbidden spell throughout this continent. &nbsp;It was simply labeled as being an insane magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Goo-ahhhhhhhhhhh!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Do this fair and square!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[I want to be of help to my comrade, but I am unable to do that!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>These mad Skeletons had been linked through the forbidden spell. &nbsp;He never expected to find such a secret technique being used in a Dungeon placed in the countryside. &nbsp;Artpe was extremely shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Maetel! &nbsp;They can recover from broken bones, so I want you to completely crush their arms and legs! &nbsp;I want you to avoid killing them at all costs!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood! &nbsp;Eh-eet! &nbsp;Eh-eeeet!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Koo-ahhhhhhhh!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, he was taken aback by all of this, but he was able to keep his shock separate from what was going on in the battle. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The most important trait for the Demon King army’s Four was composure! &nbsp;The second most important trait was also composure! &nbsp;The best way to maintain composure was to go through all the scenarios beforehand. &nbsp;One had to think about what had yet to occur, and the consequences of each scenario. &nbsp;Composure was for those who planned ahead!</span></p>
 <p><span style>First, Artpe and Maetel made it impossible for the three Skeletons to move. &nbsp;After taking care of them, they confronted the five Skeletons running towards them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bring it on!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Damn it! &nbsp;They aren’t doing the trial in a fair manner...]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh? &nbsp;Five Skeletons gathered here to attack two children. &nbsp;I’m having a hard time taking those words seriously when it is coming from you guys.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[······.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Skeletons looked taken aback when they saw their comrades roll around the floor in a pitiful state. &nbsp;However, they couldn’t do anything for them. &nbsp;The Record Link’s biggest restriction was the inability to attack one’s comrades.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If we leave them in a state where they can’t die, we can block them from strengthening themselves. &nbsp;If we hadn’t known Record Link was being used, we would have been screwed. &nbsp;However, all tactical magic is useless in front of my Read All Creation ability!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As expected, Artpe is amazing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Cowards!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You guys are almost past level 50, yet you are attacking us as a group! &nbsp;I don’t want to hear such words from you guys!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Skeletons had never expected two children under level 30 to have defeated the Elite Skeleton Warrior! &nbsp;Still, how could they start such a test in a ruthless manner! &nbsp;Which country’s customs were they following!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe followed two cherished rules. &nbsp;First, he strove for tranquility. &nbsp;Secondly, he strove for survival. &nbsp;It was already much too late to follow his first rule. &nbsp;This was why he wouldn’t hesitate to cheat for survival!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Break!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have to cancel your buff before you run out of Mana! &nbsp;Control your emotions!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She boosted her emotions to activate the strengthening option provided by the gauntlet. &nbsp;This was why she sounded more strained than usual. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, it would be impossible for her to fight straight up against the level 50 Skeletons. &nbsp;It was self-evident that the buff from the gauntlet was allowing her to do so…..</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘She’s really amped up. &nbsp;Will she able to terminate the buff when needed? &nbsp;If not…..’</span></p>
 <p><span style>One had to always keep in mind that Mana was being consumed to maintain the buff. &nbsp;If one wasn’t able to calm one’s heart, the buff would remain active until one’s Mana ran out. &nbsp;When one was out of Mana, it started to consume one’s stamina. &nbsp;This was the reason why emotion type buffs were dangerous and tricky. &nbsp;If one overdid it, the buff could cause the user’s death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wouldn’t even be funny if the heroes died in such a trivial place. &nbsp;Artpe checked that more Skeletons were coming towards them. &nbsp;He hardened his resolve as he extended his Mana Thread. &nbsp;The only spell he possessed was Hyper Rubbing, and he had to get out of this danger by using what he possessed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve taken down two of them!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are beating them to the inch of their lives to make them incapable of battle. &nbsp;Let’s coin a name for this action. &nbsp;&nbsp;Let us say we are shagging them. &nbsp;So you shagged two of them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I shagged three! &nbsp;No, I shagged four!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The struggles of the heroes had reached incredible heights! &nbsp;Artpe grabbed onto the leather strap as he sent the shield flying towards all directions. &nbsp;He inflicted the curse on the new Skeletons, who were trying to join the ongoing battle. &nbsp;Artpe had infused his power of Mana into the strap, so the tensile strength of the strap was high. &nbsp;He was also able to extend the length of the strap, so he didn’t need to worry about losing the shield!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This isn’t magic. &nbsp;It feels like I’m in a circus…. &nbsp;Shit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, the actual number of enemies unable to recklessly attack Maetel had grown to a significant number. &nbsp;The most surprising fact about shield’s curse was the fact that it could be ‘stacked’. &nbsp;The speed of the Skeleton became noticeably slower when it was hit multiple times with the shield. &nbsp;Their slow speed meant they were being taken down quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe started to revise his opinion. &nbsp;Maybe the biggest treasure left behind by the Skeleton Warrior wasn’t the gauntlet or the bastard sword. &nbsp;It might be the shield. &nbsp;This was also why the Skeletons refused to acknowledge Artpe as a ‘challenger’ for their test.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You are a coward, who hides behind a woman! &nbsp;We should kill such a male first!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[He doesn’t have the right to take this test! &nbsp;Punish him! &nbsp;Punish him!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Noooooooobody will lay a finger on Artpe!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ah, they were screwed. &nbsp;Maetel was supposed to calm herself down, but their words made her emotions spiral out of control!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She possessed supreme talent. &nbsp;She possessed a superior body compared to beings of same level as her. &nbsp;She possessed an overwhelming amount of magical energy compared to others. &nbsp;Still, it would be dangerous for her to maintain her buff at this pace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite this fact, she bravely leapt around as she took down the Skeletons….</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘She won’t be able to last long…. &nbsp;&nbsp;Her ability is great, but she’s committing all the common mistakes committed by beginner users.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her immature nature right now suited the hero’s personality, but she was with him now. &nbsp;Artpe wouldn’t allow were to act in such naive manner. &nbsp;However, there were too many Skeletons running towards them from the other side of the hallway. &nbsp;He didn’t have the time to lecture her. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If so….’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The next best option was to make sure her Mana didn’t run out. &nbsp;This would prevent the buff’s side effect from manifesting within her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So what was his options? &nbsp;Mana potion? &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unfortunately, this Dungeon didn’t drop expensive potions that would allow her to recover her Mana.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What about Mana recovery herb? &nbsp;Of course, there were rare cases where Mana herb grew in the corners of a Dungeon. &nbsp;However, this Dungeon hadn’t had any.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This meant that he had to consider his last option. &nbsp;It was Mana transfer. &nbsp;Artpe was overflowing with Mana.(He possessed Magical talent that would never be seen again in the human race. &nbsp;His body was ridiculous.) &nbsp;He just had to find a way to transfer it to Maetel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This would allow Maetel to maintain her buff, and he wouldn’t have to waste Mana on a spell like Hyper Rubbing. &nbsp;Of course, if this was easily done, he would have done it already.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘There are magic that allows one to transfer Mana to others, but I haven’t learned those spells yet.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, he would have to directly control his Mana to be able to inject it into Maetel. &nbsp;At this rate, Artpe might develop a new Mana Control Class never before seen in history. &nbsp;As he mulled over the new questions about his own identity, he grabbed a Mana Thread with his free hand. &nbsp;His other hand was holding onto the leather strap of the shield.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Maetel! &nbsp;I want you to decrease your movement radius!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All right! &nbsp;I shagged two!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel shouted with great vigor. &nbsp;She swung her bastard sword as it impacted three Skeletons. &nbsp;Their bodies were severely damaged. &nbsp;It made one think that they would be better off dead. &nbsp;In a short amount of time, she had quickly gotten used to using the bastard sword. &nbsp;This truth was self evident.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe shot out his Mana Thread towards Maetel, and it gently touched her shoulder. &nbsp;Artpe had never tried Mana transfer before, so he focused his mind as he tried to inject his Mana into her. &nbsp;Sure enough, the Mana wasn’t easily absorbed by Maetel. &nbsp;It dissipated in the middle of the process.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had delivered Mana to Maetel, but it hadn’t bolstered her Mana reserve. &nbsp;His magical energy had basically gave her a shoulder massage!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I shagged three again! &nbsp;Eh-hee hee. &nbsp;You are tickling me, Artpe.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop liking it so much. &nbsp;You are annoying me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe continuously threw and received his shield with one hand. (He didn’t know the cause behind it, but once the shield returned, it was sent out at a higher speed and strength than the previous throw. &nbsp;He was coming close to taking down as many enemies as Maetel.) &nbsp;He used his other hand to continuously send the Mana Thread towards Maetel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fail, fail and fail.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If things progressed as is, he wouldn’t become more proficient at Mana transfer. &nbsp;He would become more proficient at giving Maetel a massage!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Artpe is really amazing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The fact that your heart is always in the right place makes this much more annoying!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn’t waste his Mana like this. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Would it be more advantageous to take down the Skeletons using Hyper Rubbing?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe was having such thoughts as he turned his head. &nbsp;The number of broken Skeletons were rising. &nbsp;There were almost 50 of them. &nbsp;It was at this moment when he realized something. &nbsp;The more shocking news was that over 20 Skeletons had appeared once again at the end of the hall!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What the heck! &nbsp;You guys should just come at us all at once!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[I’m coming for you.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[I’m also coming for you.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[We are coming for you.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as if they had been waiting for Artpe’s words. &nbsp;He watched as the Skeletons surged towards him. &nbsp;When he confirmed this sight, he politely took back his words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No. &nbsp;Don’t come here. &nbsp;You don’t have to come toward us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[We’ll take up our bows to kill the coward!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh shit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Koo-ooh…. &nbsp;I won’t lose! &nbsp;I’ll protect Artpe!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skeletons, who were able to attack from a distance, had appeared. &nbsp;It was a sufficiently demoralizing sight. &nbsp;To add insult to injury, Maetel’s Mana was starting to show signs of running out! &nbsp;&nbsp;A good amount of red light was starting to emanate in vaporous form from her body. &nbsp;It was evidence that the skill was consuming her stamina instead of her magical energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are going to kill yourself, Maetel! &nbsp;You idiot!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll end this soon. &nbsp;I’ll end all of them. &nbsp;I won’t allow any of you to approach Artpe!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You cannot differentiate between bravery and foolhardiness. &nbsp;You aren’t qualified to be a hero either.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You are unqualified. &nbsp;An unqualified person cannot leave this test alive.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[It has been a long time since anyone had challenged us. &nbsp;It makes us happy, but we have to do our work.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Maetel! &nbsp;Eeek! &nbsp;I told you to stop, Maetel!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Koo-oohk, Koo-ooh-ahhhhhhhh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe kept yelling at Maetel to cancel her buff, but Maetel wasn’t showing any signs of letting up. &nbsp;&nbsp;In truth, her actions weren’t wrong. &nbsp;Her level hadn’t risen, and the gauntlet’s buff was the only reason why she was able to fight head on with the Skeletons!</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the buff ended, it would be the end for the the two of them. &nbsp;Instead of retreating, they had chosen to go forward. &nbsp;They had acted with reckless bravado.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Shit. &nbsp;This won’t do. &nbsp;I can’t transfer my Mana to her. &nbsp;Moreover, it would be foolhardy to expect her to learn Mana Drain or Stamina Drain as if it was a miracle…. &nbsp;Fuck these inflexible Skeletons. &nbsp;What shall I do…. &nbsp;Uh?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the moment when he found a clue that would help him solve this situation. &nbsp;He hadn’t discovered anything new, but he caught sight of the Record Link’s Mana stem connecting the Skeletons. &nbsp;It was the cause of their current troubles, and he suddenly saw it in new light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The Record Link is a spell that synchronizes everything. &nbsp;Of course, this spell moves towards completion as the members of the Record Link is killed. &nbsp;Isn’t the activation method of this spell &nbsp;what I’m trying to accomplish?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had a moment of enlightenment. &nbsp;Of course, this was possible only because Artpe had a cheat-like ability called the Read All Creation. &nbsp;Artpe had to get out of this ridiculous situation, and his brain moved in a flexible manner to come up with a solution.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If I do this right, I’ll be able to do it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The main idea behind the Record Link was a connection established using a specific resonance frequency. There was a big commanality between Artpe and Maetel that could be used as a medium. &nbsp;They were the only two people in the world, who had the Hero Class. &nbsp;This was something they shared between the two of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The Hero Class is an intrinsic characteristic that trumps all others. &nbsp;It’s possible. &nbsp;I’ll be able to do this..’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe’s eyes were shining brightly. &nbsp;At that moment, he realized he had learned a new magic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had thought acquiring skills, which was incongruent with one’s level, was something only a genius like Maetel was allowed to do. &nbsp;However, he had been wrong. &nbsp;He wasn’t sure if his prior knowledge and observations helped in the process, but Artpe was able to join Maetel’s company as being someone capable of creating new skills!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Maetel! &nbsp;Your senses might expand a little bit, and your Mana will become amplified. &nbsp;Stay focused!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I understand….!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As expected, her answer was alway cheerful. &nbsp;She was well aware of the fact that her stamina was being consumed right now, but she refused to end her buff. &nbsp;Maetel was still bravely fighting off dozens of Skeletons. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe was blocking the long range attacks using his shield, but if the situation remained the same, the two of them would be wiped out. &nbsp;He could guarantee it. &nbsp;He had to use his magic before it was too late.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We are connected by traveling the same road. &nbsp;Reveal the line that connects us. &nbsp;Our sights view the same enemies. &nbsp;My rage shall become her rage, and it shall descend.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The coward is trying to use a weird trick once again.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[We have to stop him. &nbsp;We have to stop him, but….]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Artpe…. &nbsp;You can’t touch him…..!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her anger kept rising everytime the Skeletons tried to aim for Artpe. &nbsp;Now it just took them mentioning Artpe’s name to set her off. &nbsp;Her eyes were raised sharply, and she was more scarier than an evil spirit as she swung her sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a red fog emanating from her entire body now. &nbsp;She wasn’t just consuming her Stamina anymore. &nbsp;She had learned a skill that was deadly and horrifying compared to all the Skills she had learned up until now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Maetel]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Level : 32]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Berserk Lv1]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Somehow I had a feeling &nbsp;she would… &nbsp;In the end, she learned the Berserk skill.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was an emblematic skill used by the Berserkers. &nbsp;It was the worst type of mental skill one could learn. &nbsp;The Berserk skill would make one kill everyone. &nbsp;It didn’t matter if one was an ally or a foe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no level restriction in learning it, and it didn’t exist in the form of a Skill Book. &nbsp;The user had to fulfill requirement that were close to being diabolical to be able to learn it. &nbsp;This was why it was very rare to see it in action, yet Maetel had just learned it. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The Bone Gauntlet boosted the strength of the user as the user’s emotions was raised. &nbsp;The Berserk skill dealt with a single emotion called rage. &nbsp;It increased one’s attack by decreasing one’s defense. &nbsp;It was a very rare self-buff skill. &nbsp;Of course, the side effect was so much worse than the ones given by the bone gauntlet. &nbsp;It was so severe that it made one shudder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ll be fine even with that skill. &nbsp;Link the Mana!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Artpe finally completed his spell. &nbsp;This particular Mana Thread was very fine. &nbsp;One couldn’t even draw a comparison with the Mana Threads he had created before. &nbsp;This thread was letting out the five cardinal colors, and it created a direct line between Artpe’s heart and Maetel’s heart. &nbsp;The Skeletons couldn’t prevent the connection from forming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the next moment, Maetel spoke in a peculiar voice. &nbsp;Artpe smiled when he confirmed that his magic had worked. The Skeletons shook when they saw the change in her spirit. &nbsp;They held an overwhelming number advantage, yet they started to slowly retreat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Artpe….is the best.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel mumbled her words. &nbsp;Artpe’s overflowing Mana was being poured into Maetel’s body in its entirety.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The stamina that had already been consumed did not recover, but her body was granted an extreme amount of Mana that her body wasn’t allowed to possess at this stage. &nbsp;Her body temporarily took the next step forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[That person stole our secret technique.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[No, that is…. &nbsp;It might be superior than our technique.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[My god…. &nbsp;&nbsp;They are true heroes.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[They are qualified to be heroes! &nbsp;They are brilliantly proving this fact!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even if you acknowledge us now, you are too late.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel raised her head, and her eyes were sparkling. &nbsp;She hunched forward. &nbsp;All the muscles in her body was tense. &nbsp;She looked like a panther about to pounce it prey. &nbsp;The powerful magical energy and the overwhelming power of the Berserk Skill reconciled with each other to surround her entire body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won’t let you all run away!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was hard to call what happened next as a battle. &nbsp;It would be more appropriate to say they were hunted down by her.</span></p>
