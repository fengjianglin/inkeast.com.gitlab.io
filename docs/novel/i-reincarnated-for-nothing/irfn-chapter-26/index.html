 <p>Chapter 26 - Yesterday's Enemy (5)</p>
 <p><span style>The sun brightened the morning. &nbsp;Artpe caught several fishes from the ravine, and he used the Mana String to clean them. &nbsp;This magic wasn’t meant to be used this way, but he didn’t care. He was killing two birds with one stone by leveling up his Spell Level. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maybe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow. &nbsp;Artpe’s hand movements are exquisite.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not trying to boast, but I have a knack for useless talents.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Leseti, are all magicians able to use such an odd spell?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is the first time I’ve seen such a spell. &nbsp;It seems he is more special since he is a hero.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Silpennon and Leseti was also watching this sight. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>If spoken bluntly, they had lost their positions and their escort guards. &nbsp;They were beggars now. &nbsp;Artpe felt a little bit bad for just sending them away, so he decided to send them off after a meal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So you guys didn’t bring any foods you can eat?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We did bring a lot of money. &nbsp;Our kingdom specializes in manufacturing Dimensional Pouches.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m sure you know this, but I’ll say it just in case. &nbsp;Don’t spend large sums of money in any old place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why not?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe looked away from Silpennon. &nbsp;He looked at Leseti with sympathy in his eyes. &nbsp;He could clearly see the difficulty she would have to endure in the future.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“······hoong.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh-eet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Leseti avoided his gaze as her cheeks reddened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In her stead, Maetel pinched Artpe’s thigh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>What the hell? &nbsp;Why were their reactions switched? </span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe was bewildered as he rubbed at his thigh. &nbsp;At that moment, the crown prince added a supplementary explanation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“For the past 20 years of her life, Leseti only focused on self-training and protecting me. &nbsp;She is a poor woman, who has yet to date a man. &nbsp;Even if you are young, she is accepting you in that fashion, because she is very thirsty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your highness, it has been an honor to be able to serve you until now. &nbsp;Please be happy in your future endeavors.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you unsheathing your sword! &nbsp;I always trusted you to be by my side!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You revealed the reason why!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You aren’t using honorifics!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Such a simple method was able to eliminate her sense of loyalty. &nbsp;He had a better idea now on why the Diaz Kingdom were overrun by the rebels. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He finished cleaning the fishes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe kept a small steel pot alongside his money inside the Dimensional Pouch. &nbsp;Maetel brought over edible plants, and he put in spices(50 bronze) he bought from the merchant. &nbsp;When the water came to a boil, he put the fishes in. &nbsp;Soon, a very pleasant smell started to emanate from it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems you are very experienced at doing all of this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you fight and live in the mountains and fields, this type of skills becomes second nature to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The four people ate the finished fish soup. &nbsp;The rations supplemented the meal. &nbsp;The food was eaten in a blink of an eye. &nbsp;Maetel alway ate whatever Artpe made as if it was delicious. &nbsp;He could give her a ball of dirt, and she would say it was delicious. &nbsp;However, he had thought Silpennon would have a picky palate, since he was the crown prince. &nbsp;He ate it without complaining, and he even gave Artpe a compliment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you. &nbsp;I enjoyed it very much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How should I say this? &nbsp;You are so polite that it is annoying.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm. &nbsp;His competency for household chores are great….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He decided not to ask Leseti about what she was checking. &nbsp;Artpe finished washing the dishes. &nbsp;He stood up after he put away the pot into the Dimensional Pouch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go our own way from here on out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is there any way we can go with you guys? &nbsp;I guess this is to be expected. &nbsp;My ability is pitiful compared to you guys…...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Silpennon was in low spirits. &nbsp;He lowered his head as he mumbled those words. &nbsp;This was the first time he had escaped the mantle of his position as the crown prince. &nbsp;It was at this moment that he realized how powerless he was for the first time in his life. &nbsp;His direction in life going forward would be determined on how he remedied that fact.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe had a bitter expression on his face, and he asked Silpennon a question as if he was asking it in passing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So what do you plan on doing from here on out?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I planned on finding the heroes. &nbsp;Then I wanted to achieve the merit of defeating the Demon King. &nbsp;However, that plan fell into pieces, so I don’t know what….. &nbsp;&nbsp;I can’t go back to the castle. &nbsp;In truth, &nbsp;I’m at a dead end.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Leseti, do you have any other plans?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He is an annoying human being, but he is my lord. &nbsp;I will protect him until I’m able to. &nbsp;That is it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Basically, you don’t have any other plans.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Koohk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had expected her to be a little bit smarter than Silpennon, but it seemed Leseti also didn’t know much about the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he let them go like this, they would die somewhere without anyone knowing about it. &nbsp;He could only see a miserable death for them in the future.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“······ssp. I guess it can’t be helped. ”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe let out a sigh as he gave them a proposal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s form a temporary party.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you….letting us into your party!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Silpennon’s eyes shone, and even Leseti had a healthy glow when she heard the news. &nbsp;Maetel looked as if she was unsatisfied with something.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I like being with Artpe. &nbsp;Just the two of us….”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is temporary. &nbsp;We’ll do this until we clear one Dungeon. &nbsp;If I let this guy leave, he’ll suffer a rough fate. &nbsp;I’ll give him some basic lessons. &nbsp;I’ll let him become indebted to me, and I’m sure he’ll bring something back to me in the future.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you supposed to say that in front of the person you are talking about?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Silpennon spoke as he was dumbfounded, but his face remained bright. &nbsp;He now knew that Artpe cared about them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he saw Artpe ruthlessly kill the knights, he had doubts as to whether he was a hero. &nbsp;As expected, he was good at a fundamental level!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, Artpe’s intention was entirely different from what Silpennon had attributed to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Even if he was the crown prince, they don’t let anyone join the hero’s party. &nbsp;One has to be excellent and skilled at a very basic level. &nbsp;That is why the party members are able to stick around the hero without dying.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The crown prince had the talent to become a thief. He was very remarkable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he was trained properly, he’ll be able to gain fame within the kingdom within couple years. &nbsp;No, his name would spread throughout the continent. &nbsp;Of course, in his past life, Silpennon was locked away inside the palace for five years alongside Maetel, and the rest was history.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If I expend a little bit of my time here, I can create a foundation he can build on. &nbsp;I would be making a powerful card that I can use later against the Demon King’s army. &nbsp;Moreover, he seems to have a personality of wanting to repay his debts. &nbsp;In light of that fact, there isn’t much downside in doing this.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>If one received a favor, it had to be paid pack. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a reasonable sentiment. It was also true that it was hard to make good on such sentiments. &nbsp;However, the crown prince in front of him might have that great quality where he would keep true to his duties.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have a question.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Silpennon hadn’t opened his mouth. &nbsp;It was Leseti.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You just said a Dungeon. &nbsp;You speak so lightly about it…. &nbsp;Do you realize it is very hard to find a Dungeon? &nbsp;At this moment, countless adventurers are looking a Dungeon in an attempt to strike it rich. &nbsp;They roam the land, but they are barely able to find one after they fruitlessly search for several years. &nbsp;Even if they do find one, they just suffer a dog’s death.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m already well aware of that fact.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If we want to clear a decent Dungeon, we'll have to stay together for couple years. &nbsp;Is this a roundabout way of accepting us into your party?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maybe Leseti was hoping her words were true. &nbsp;She had come here based on the idea that she had to save the crown prince. &nbsp;However, she wasn’t talented at anything except fighting and protecting someone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was young, yet he had ridiculous amount of power. &nbsp;Moreover, he was talented in many facets. &nbsp;If they were able to join Artpe’s party, she would be able to just focus on fighting and guarding the crown prince.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On top of that, if the crown prince was able to grow up splendidly and play a support role in defeating the Demon King, he would be able to return triumphantly as the scion of the Diaz family. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, aren’t I right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was 20 years old, but from Artpe’s perspective, she still looked like a brat to him. &nbsp;She was trying hard to appear as if she was calm. &nbsp;However, there was a catch and a slight tremor in her voice that betrayed the desperation she was feeling. &nbsp;Artpe let out a laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ll see.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two days had passed. &nbsp;The party stood in front of an old tree that was rotting away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was hiding there? &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was none other than an entrance to the Dungeon. &nbsp;Artpe merely extended his Mana, and the hollow portion of the tree expanded. &nbsp;It was readied itself to accept the adventurers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No way…...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is impossible!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Leseti had an agitated expression on her face. &nbsp;Silpennon was shocked as he turned to look at Artpe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How were you able to find it so quickly…..?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Accidents and events have a way of finding heroes even if they stay put, yet we are actively searching for a Dungeon right now. &nbsp;Of course, one or two Dungeons would show up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heroes are truly amazing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right. &nbsp;Artpe is truly amazing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This is why it is convenient to have idiots around!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The magical energy I sense isn’t high or dense. &nbsp;The monsters inside will be of the common variety. &nbsp;Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t as if this was an insignificant Dungeon. &nbsp;However, it couldn’t be disputed that it was a lousy Dungeon crawling with low level Slimes. &nbsp;Even if it was a lousy Dungeon, it was a very large one. &nbsp;This was why no adventurer was able to completely conquer this Dungeon in his past life! &nbsp;This was true even at the time of his death!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Here. &nbsp;You should arm yourself with this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ooh-mmmmm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe tossed a crappy equipment that Silpennon could arm himself with. &nbsp;Silpennon took the dagger, and he spoke with an uncertain voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do….do you think I can do this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who wanted an active role inside the hero’s party?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......I did.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At Artpe’s light provocation, Silpennon answered back with a firm voice. &nbsp;He nodded his head several times as if he was making a resolve. &nbsp;He gripped the dagger so hard that veins started to pop out on the back of his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All right. &nbsp;Since the hero plans on guiding me, I can’t turn that opportunity down. &nbsp;I’ll do it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are no longer in the position of being the crown prince. &nbsp;From now on, I want you to think about what position you want, and what kind of fighting style you want to fight with. &nbsp;You should battle with those points in your mind.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He started fidgeting with the short sword in one hand. &nbsp;He asked a question. &nbsp;It seemed his other hand was feeling empty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you have another one that is similar to this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmmm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The act of using weapons with both hands sounded easy, but it wasn’t something he would recommend….. &nbsp;Well, it would be helpful if he experienced this fact. &nbsp;At his request, Artpe took out another short sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All right. &nbsp;The balance finally feels right. In truth, when I was bored within the palace, I used to busy my hands like this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It must have been great. &nbsp;It seem being the crown prince was a job of leisure.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Silpennon was finally satisfied after he alternately swung his daggers in each hand. &nbsp;At that moment, his information was updated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Silpennon Le Diaz]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Level : 7]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Dual Wielding Lv1]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s right. &nbsp;If seen in certain light, this guy would be considered to be a genius. &nbsp;Artpe was dumbfounded as he let out a bitter laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Anyways, Silpennon was now ready for battle. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Leseti looked a bit disappointed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel had spend a year in a Dungeon, yet it seemed she was eager to go into another one. &nbsp;She was excited.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We are doing this Dungeon exploration to grow Silpennon’s ability. &nbsp;If possible, we should stay out of his way. &nbsp;Even if there are traps, we won’t be telling you about it, so you should firm your resolve. &nbsp;Is that clear?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…. all right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Silpennon gulped as he nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The party members entered the Dungeon side by side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first one to speak inside the Dungeon was Maetel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Artpe, there are a lot of something here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A lot? &nbsp;It should be. &nbsp;This Dungeon has a pretty high monster regeneration, but it is frequented by…. &nbsp;Huh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as he entered the Dungeon, Artpe sensed an unusual amount of signatures. &nbsp;He activated his Read All Creation ability, and he was able to see that the numerous monsters were all Slimes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A thought came to him at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘When was this Dungeon became known to the humans?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was easily able to find the answer. &nbsp;In his past life, the Dungeon was first found by the hero’s party when they exited the palace. &nbsp;This Dungeon was revealed to the other adventurers after it was found by them. &nbsp;Of course, no one in this world knew about this place at this point in time!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah. &nbsp;It seems we are the discoverers.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Discoverer? Is it something good?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, it is good. &nbsp;No one has touched this place, so the rewards will be great. &nbsp;Since the traps are brand new, it’ll be hidden completely, so it’ll be thrilling to go through this place. &nbsp;You’ll also be able to experience monsters collapsing towards you…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It sounds as if the negative outweighs the good!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe looked down towards the end of the dark and damp corridor made out of wood. &nbsp;An incredibly large army of Slimes were coming towards them. &nbsp;Silpennon had also caught sight of them, and his face turned pale. &nbsp;Artpe let out a kind smile towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cheer up. &nbsp;You can do this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait a moment. &nbsp;This is a bit different from what we’ve talked about… &nbsp;Goo-ahk!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Slimes knew that the intruders were ridiculously strong by instinct. &nbsp;This was why they immediately focused on Silpennon, who was the only one they had a shot of winning against.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Silpennon turned pale as he was about to encounter the Slimes. &nbsp;However, no one stepped forward to help him. &nbsp;In the end, he was instantly buried by the group of Slimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe’s apathetic gaze turned towards Leseti. &nbsp;He asked her a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, guardian knight. &nbsp;What are you doing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I trust in his highness. &nbsp;Well, if he dies, it can’t be help. &nbsp;&nbsp;By the way, Artpe, would you accept me into your party if I’m alone?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are very forthright.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ooh-ah-roo-koo-ahh-gyah-gyah-gyahk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed Leseti’s way of thinking reached a turning point on her 20th year in life. &nbsp;Silpennon was buried by the Slimes, so it was hard to tell what he was yelling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your highness, I have faith in in you! &nbsp;Still, just to safe, you should tell me what kind of funeral you want! &nbsp;You should have told me beforehand!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ooh-gahh-gyahhhhhhhhk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After 45 minutes, Silpennon used his Dual Wielding style to kill all the Slimes. &nbsp;The three people smiled at him as if they knew he would have succeeded. &nbsp;He had no words for them. &nbsp;He just clenched his two fists, and he made a resolve!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll become stronger… &nbsp;I will become stronger at all cost!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, that’s the spirit!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ooh-ahhhhhhhhhh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was how the hero’s party started their second Dungeon exploration.</span></p>
