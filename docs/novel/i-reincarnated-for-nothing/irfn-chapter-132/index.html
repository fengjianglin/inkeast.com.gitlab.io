 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll think about it after I face her.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The members of Artpe’s party didn’t have to think about anything else. &nbsp;They just focused all their power on reaching their enemy. &nbsp;They prepared their Mana. &nbsp;Their Mana reached a fevered pitch, and they were just waiting for the moment where they would unleash their deadly energy towards their enemy.</span></p>
