 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That is······ That is…...”</span></p>

We’ve already held out for far too long. &nbsp;In the past five month, our progress have stalled. &nbsp;We are just going back and forth in an endless loop of retreating and charging. &nbsp;Since the pathway to the ocean is blocked by the Lunatic Wave, the plan was to bottle up Aedia from our side, and the side of Tiata. &nbsp;We were supposed to weaken Aedia by raiding them through the fall and winter. &nbsp;We were supposed to make them use up all their resources, yet that hasn't happened. &nbsp;Aedia seems to have felt no ill effects. &nbsp;Instead, my country is suffering! &nbsp;I have no choice, but to use special countermeasures!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The attack on the port city of Belata was part of his special countermeasures. &nbsp;Daitan had reached its limit. &nbsp;This was why they broke the international law by sending their elite troops against Belata. &nbsp;It was a last ditch attempt to tilt the balance of war in their favor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if they were able to secure the upper hand in the war, it was as if all their problems would have been solved. &nbsp;Daitan was already seen as the invader, and now his country would have caused civilian deaths. &nbsp;Daitan’s future was dark even if they had won the war.</span></p>

Who came up with this plan of pressuring Aedia to make it a war of attrition?”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Was the king’s intelligence lacking compared to the strong power he possessed? &nbsp;Or did he put trust in the honor between men to establish the alliance? &nbsp;It didn’t matter what had occured. &nbsp;Either option had been endlessly foolish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s think this through. &nbsp;The ocean is not passable right now. &nbsp;The north and the western border was closed. &nbsp; No resources are able to enter into Aedia, so how are they able to hold out so well? &nbsp;Did they use their awesome power of magic to transport supplies?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are talking about transporting supplies to feed an enormous army…... &nbsp;Is it possible?”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was one of the skills he had needed as one of the Four Heavenly Kings. &nbsp;It was the skill to play one side against the other! &nbsp;Words flowed out of Artpe like water as he made a persuasive argument. &nbsp;The king of Daitan’s eyes turned sharper as he looked towards the Duke of Tiata. &nbsp;Since there was no possible way Aedia could receive supply from an outside source, that only left the Dukedom of Tiata. &nbsp;The Duke was supposed to be his ally!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bullshit! &nbsp;You and I came up with that plan in collaboration!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I did agree with your plan. &nbsp;However, five months have passed, and this is the result of that plan. &nbsp;In your opinion, how do you think our enemies replenished their supplies? &nbsp;Please persuade me once again like before.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sir Zard······!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the end. &nbsp;There was suspicion but no evidence. &nbsp;However, the mood had decidedly shifted against him. &nbsp;He wouldn’t be able to overturn this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The words spoken by the king of Daitan was the decisive factor. &nbsp;Logic wasn’t important right now. &nbsp;It was power. &nbsp;It didn’t matter if the king believed the Dukedom of Tiata wasn’t connected to Aedia. &nbsp;The king of Daitan had made a choice, and he wouldn’t budge from it.</span></p>
