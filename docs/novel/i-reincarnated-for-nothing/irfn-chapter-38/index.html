 <p>Chapter 38 - Come to Think of It, I'm a Hero (6)</p>
 <p><span style>He had become a hero, so he finally stiffened his resolve to fight the Demon King. &nbsp;So what the hell was this? &nbsp;The Demon King was trying to change humans into demons? &nbsp;Artpe wanted to farm in the human world at a later date. &nbsp;It would be a problem if the human world was turned into the demon world! &nbsp;&nbsp;He wouldn’t forgive anyone who attempted to pour cold water on Artpe’s retirement plan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe’s burning will was infused into the Mana Strings, and they burrowed into her body. &nbsp;From the beginning, Artpe hadn’t planned on stopping the change entirely. &nbsp;A complete reversal of the change was impossible. &nbsp;Such tasks were in the territory of the gods.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only thing he could do was influence the direction of the change. &nbsp;Yes, it was the same as when he made the changes to the Record Link inside the Dungeon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I just have to prevent her from becoming a demon. &nbsp;She also has to have control over herself. &nbsp;I have to protect these two things. &nbsp;It is a must.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe used all the experience he gained from his past life as he tuned her with his Mana Strings. &nbsp;The Mana Strings infused with the power of the Read All Creation ability continuously moved in a subtle manner to suppress the changes caused by the Mana, and the Mana was directed towards a different direction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whether it was his life as a demon or a human hero, his Innate Ability had always been with him. &nbsp;It was really ironic that these these two vastly different experiences was of help when dealing with this problem.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He now had extensive knowledge about demons and humans. &nbsp;His knowledge allowed him to combine the Mana String and the Read All Creation ability. &nbsp;It gave him the ability to open a new path for the Mana within Sienna’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah. &nbsp;Ah-ooh-ooh-ahhhhhh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can you hear me, Sienna? &nbsp;You have to resist against the impulse to fight the flow of Mana. &nbsp;You have to concentrate, and you have to be clear in your thoughts. &nbsp;You can’t be swayed by your impulse.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe kept talking to Sienna, who was groaning from the pain she was feeling. &nbsp;He continued to manipulate his Mana Strings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In some aspects, he had to concentrate harder than the time when he had absorbed all the curse in this communal space at once. &nbsp;However, he was fueled by his anger towards the Demon King, and an urgent need to prevent Maetel from becoming wounded by this incident. &nbsp;There were multiple factors driving him forward, so this task was really nothing to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sienna, Sienna!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stay still, Aena. I also feel restless, but…. &nbsp;&nbsp;If we interfere with Artpe right now, Sienna will be in big trouble.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ooh ooh ooh······!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel had calmed down thanks to Artpe, so she was able to hold back the agitated Aena. &nbsp;She &nbsp;gathered the children to one side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if they had been freed from the curse, they hadn’t bathed since arriving here. &nbsp;Moreover, &nbsp;they hadn’t been fed. &nbsp;The state of their health was a mess. &nbsp;If she wanted their bodies to feel the least amount of stress, she would have to send them outside the Dungeon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Noonah, I’m hungry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m cold. &nbsp;I’m scared. &nbsp;Who is that hyung? &nbsp;Is he on the same side as the ajusshi? &nbsp;Will we turn out weird like her?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, everything is fine. &nbsp;You will all be better soon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel was still a child. &nbsp;She was at an age where she should be under the protection of adults. &nbsp;However, she didn’t hesitate to take care of children who were of similar age as her. &nbsp;In fact, she took care of kids that were older than her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’m tired. &nbsp;I’m tired and exhausted. &nbsp;I want to rest.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>She glanced at the cowering children, then she turned to look at Artpe. &nbsp;He was using an incomprehensibly complex magic to save the last child.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His eyes didn’t falter as brilliant Mana rose out of him. &nbsp;She was sure he was more tired than her, yet Artpe only thought about the task at hand. &nbsp;&nbsp;He did the impossible without hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘All right.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel poured strength into her body as she stood up. &nbsp;If Artpe had seen her, she was sure he would have been happy at how she was handling herself. &nbsp;He would have praised her. &nbsp;This thought allowed her to wade through anything that was thrown her way..</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘A little bit more! &nbsp;Shit! &nbsp;A little bit more!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe was panting right now. &nbsp;The girl was floating in the air a little bit as she was continuously showing reaction to the Mana.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her skin had turned black before, but now it was the opposite. &nbsp;She enough white enough to be called pale, and even her hair had turned into a peculiar milk-like color. &nbsp;In truth, the Mana reaction she was experiencing was large and fierce. &nbsp;It was an indication that the current situation was unstable. &nbsp;It felt as if the situation could run away from him, and she would go on a rampage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“O...oppa.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hold on. &nbsp;You can do this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Artpe saw her, he realized the truth that this wasn’t just an adventure. &nbsp;This was why he couldn’t give up now. &nbsp;&nbsp;The girl labored as she opened her eyes to look at him. &nbsp;He gave her words of encouragement to lift her spirits, and he desperately guided her Mana.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The full sense of self that cannot be tampered. &nbsp;A body that isn’t sullied by the demonic energy.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He dismantled the Mana that was causing changes to her record and structure. &nbsp;He destroyed the path laid in front of him as he promoted a new path. &nbsp;It was something impossible to do if he hadn’t possessed the Read All Creation ability and the Mana String.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was using an Innate Ability and a Unique skill at the same time, so he was consuming an extreme amount of Mana. &nbsp;This was why he was having having a hard time breathing, and he felt dizzy. &nbsp;Still, he didn’t stop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This wasn’t simply about saving a girl. &nbsp;The Demon King was trying some bullshit of a plan where he was trying to turn humans into demons. &nbsp;This was the first step in destroying the plan crafted by that petty and crafty coward!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The change that was turning Sienna into a demon had been occurring at a straightforward manner. &nbsp;The massive flow of Mana had been repeatedly moving forward before it gave way. &nbsp;Now that massive amount of Mana had come to a stop. &nbsp;It was a miracle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“······oppa.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe’s eyes suddenly flew open.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Someone was grabbing onto the edge of his robe. &nbsp;He didn’t even have to look to know who it was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“······you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The girl had opened her eyes, and she was looking at Artpe with a very faint smile on her face. Her Mana rushed towards the new path paved by Artpe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sienna had succeeding in learning the Mana Control!</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Sienna]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Level : 1]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Mana Control Lv1]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So if I go this way…. &nbsp;&nbsp;It’ll be fine?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha. &nbsp;When I read that you were an experiment success, I recognized…..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed this girl had some talent in dealing with Mana. &nbsp;Artpe smirked as he had this thought. &nbsp;Silpennon had to pay 210 gold to purchase the Mana Control skill book. &nbsp;He probably would have felt aggrieved if he knew about this. &nbsp;However, this was great news for Artpe. </span></p>
 <p><span style>At her sense of achievement, he gave her a toothy smile as he spoke to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, let’s try this together once.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, oppa.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe showed her the way, and Sienna tried hard to follow him. &nbsp;As her Mana went further down the path, it was changing the density of her Mana and the light within her. &nbsp;Her body was also being affected by the Mana, so small changes started appearing once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, this wasn’t a path that would end with her becoming a human. &nbsp;However, the path wouldn’t lead her down the path to becoming a demon either. &nbsp;Her free will as a human had been successfully preserved. &nbsp;The only thing left was for her to confront the curse that was trying to turn her into a demon. &nbsp;When she rejected it, she would become something new!</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If this is successful, I pretty much have a thesis that would be a big hit in the human world and demon world….!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it didn’t matter which side he revealed the information to. &nbsp;He couldn’t tell anyone about this, because he would become the enemy of the world. &nbsp;He felt aggrieved at the fact that he couldn’t reveal this information! &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe took out a Mana Potion, and he drank it. &nbsp;Then he added more fuel into controlling his Mana Strings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He activated the Read All Creation to its limit. &nbsp;It revealed the path of the Mana within Sienna’s body to his eyes. &nbsp;He merged this path with the Mana Strings, and he sealed all the circuitry related to the demon race. &nbsp;Then he guided her Mana.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her body writhed, and her hair became luminous. &nbsp;However, Artpe and Sienna no longer paid attention to such changes. &nbsp;Sienna was handling her Mana for the first time, and she was drunk on the experience. &nbsp;Pain couldn’t hold a candle to the joy of the Mana!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oppa.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You aren’t too far off. &nbsp;Just a little bit more. &nbsp;You need to take one more step.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“One step.. I just have to take one more step······!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The trace energy of the demon race was slowly disappearing. &nbsp;As the circuitry for the demon race was sealed, a new Mana circuitry revealed itself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a path that was neither human or demon. &nbsp;As she traveled further down the path, her Mana kept getting brighter as its constitution changed! &nbsp;When Artpe confirmed the changed, he unconsciously clenched his fist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It’s done······! &nbsp;It really worked!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I did it, oppa!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was Sienna’s voice. &nbsp;It seemed she could also feel her curse being blocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In truth, he could no longer feel the energy of the Demon race within her. &nbsp;The only downside was the fact that he could barely feel the energy of a human from her. &nbsp;It was enough for her not to run afoul of the Demon King’s Innate ability!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kyahhhk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The circuitry was now complete. &nbsp;It passed through her entire body, and the Mana started circulating within her body at a rapid pace. &nbsp;It created a noisy sound that deafened everyone’s ears.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ooh-ahhhhhhhh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ooh-goo-goohk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe groaned as he desperately observed what was going on. &nbsp;It was the method that would allow one to escape the curse that made one into a demon. &nbsp;The method that would allow him to properly fuck over the Demon King was being engraved into Sienna’s body in real time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Above all things, It was a very valuable record. &nbsp;Maybe his reincarnation occurred, so he could learn this information!</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the next moment, a bright light was emitted from her body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, a new information appeared in front of Artpe’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Sienna]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Level : 2]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Race : Evil Reflecter]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pffft.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he found out the name of her race, he let out a laugh. &nbsp;Evil Reflecter? &nbsp;How can such a childish and obvious name could exist for a race! &nbsp;Was it because she was born by rejecting the Demon race! &nbsp;It made him want to go find god. &nbsp;Artpe wanted to ask what he was thinking when he made the name.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, he was happy. &nbsp;He was unsure if he could be happier than what he was feeling right now. &nbsp;This really was the first step to destroy the ambitions possessed by the Demon King!</span></p>
 <p><span style>So this was it. &nbsp;This was why everyone wanted to become a hero! &nbsp;Artpe was feeling an emotion that clashed with him at a fundamental level, so he became self-absorbed in it. &nbsp;However, at that moment, someone tugged at his robe. &nbsp;Of course, it was Sienna.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oppa!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, you did well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe was breaking out in cold sweat as he smiled. &nbsp;He stroked her head as he comforted her. &nbsp;Her skin remained pale, and her hair was white too. &nbsp;However, her hair was lustrous. &nbsp;Unlike before, she was full of life energy and magical energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had white skin, and white luminous hair. &nbsp;Sienna looked very alien, but this actually made look very charming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She looked a little bit younger than Maetel, and the girl let out a bright and innocent smile towards her rescuer. &nbsp;She had met Artpe for the first time today, but the smile contained an unlimited amount of trust towards Artpe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you, oppa”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s nothing. &nbsp;I gained some very good data thanks to you. &nbsp;I should be the one thanking you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh heh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the moment Sienna started becoming a demon to the moment where she became an Evil Reflecter, he had observed and recorded everything with his Read All Creation ability. &nbsp;Of course, it was still impossible for him, but this record would allow him to research a method to counter the demonifying curse. &nbsp;He might be able to come up with a method that’ll allow him to resist against the Demon King’s ability.!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sienna!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Unni.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe let go of Artpe’s robe, and she rested herself completely on the floor. &nbsp;She hugged her unni, who had run towards her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel had looked on with a nervous heart. &nbsp;She had been sad at the thought of one more child becoming a monster. &nbsp;Maetel and the other children were truly relieved at the sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m glad you are fine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is all thanks to oppa. &nbsp;Oppa helped me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“······mmmm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maetel had a smile on her face. &nbsp;However, when she heard Sienna’s bright voice and face, she started creeping towards Artpe’s side. &nbsp;She grabbed his robe. &nbsp;There was still a smile on her face, but there was a sense of gloominess that was a small part of her expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is a relief that Sienna is fine. &nbsp;Right, Artpe?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It feels as if there is a smidge of regret in your voice, Maetel.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are mistaken. &nbsp;I’m really happy. &nbsp;I want Aena and Sienna to live a happy life. &nbsp;At the town… Just the two of them...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mmm. &nbsp;It seemed he hadn’t been mistaken. &nbsp;Maetel was burning with jealousy towards a girl that was younger than her. &nbsp;&nbsp;Why was the hero wired like this! &nbsp;Artpe flicked Maetel’s forehead as he sighed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Anyways, the Quest was complete. &nbsp;He couldn't save the children that had already been turned into monsters. &nbsp;However, he couldn’t be sad about the missed opportunity. &nbsp;He decided it was right to be thankful for those that he was able to save with his hands. &nbsp;When he had this thought, he suddenly felt fatigue wash over his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“······ooh-ah. &nbsp;I want to rest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, Artpe. &nbsp;I really want to rest too.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Artpe’s words were heartfelt. &nbsp;Maetel let out a bitter laugh as she agreed with him. &nbsp;They looked at each other, and they started giggling. &nbsp;Then they turned to look at the children, who were staring at them in puzzlement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go home.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No. &nbsp;I want to wash myself first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to wash myself too!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m hungry!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed the fear that had gripped the children were gone thanks to Artpe’s activities. &nbsp;As if they had made a promise beforehand, the children started expressing their desires. &nbsp;Soon, the communal space descended into chaos.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, a person with the all-round ability that could grant all their wishes made her entrance!</span></p>
