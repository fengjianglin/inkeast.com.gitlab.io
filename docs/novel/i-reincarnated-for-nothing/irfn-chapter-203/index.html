 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It had only taken three hours for Artpe’s party to turn the whole Demon realm into the human realm. &nbsp;However, Artpe didn’t stop his Reclamation magic there. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those that were twisted didn’t only exist in the Demon realm. &nbsp;There were beings in the human realm that had been twisted by the Demon energy. &nbsp;Artpe kept using the Reclamation magic until there was no reaction to the magic tome.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had used his Innate ability Rewrite, and he had resonated it with the Reclamation magic. &nbsp;This was why the pool of Mana available to him had diminished by a significant amount. &nbsp;Still, he was able to complete everything before he used up all the Artifacts and Magic Stones he had prepared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you sure this place is the Demon realm?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It isn’t any more.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Blood colored clouds had always crowded the skies of the Demon realm. &nbsp;There was not a single vestige left of these clouds. &nbsp;Moreover, it was meaningless to differentiate between the Demon realm and the human realm now. &nbsp;In the past, the Demon realm had merely been a continent that was part of the human realm. &nbsp;Now humanity would record this land as a continent once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Artpe, at the end….. &nbsp; What happened? &nbsp;How did you stop that?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I just returned everything to its original form.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Artpe was very calm as he answered her. &nbsp;He hugged the magic tome to his body, and it started to melt into Artpe’s body. &nbsp;The magic tome joined with his soul, and it once again strengthened his Innate Ability. &nbsp;The party was struck dumb as they watched Artpe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Silpenon had passed the Magic Stone to Artpe. &nbsp;The Magic Stone merely strengthened Artpe’s Innate Ability for a brief moment, but it acted as a spark plug. &nbsp;It had spurred on his awakening. &nbsp;His Read All Creation ability had already reached its 2nd stage, but now he was conscious of his ability. &nbsp;It allowed him to freely used the 2nd stage of his Read All Creation ability. &nbsp;He was able to use the Rewrite ability.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">First, he combined his Innate ability with the Unique spell called Materialization. &nbsp;Then he combined it with the Reclamation magic. &nbsp;His ability had become whole. &nbsp;In the end, these were abilities that had been cultivated from Artpe in the first place. &nbsp;It was the natural consequence of everything combining into one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This appeared where the previous Demon King had died.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Silpennon had retrieved a small Magic Stone. &nbsp;It had contained a massive amount of Demonic energy, but it couldn’t escape the influence of the Reclamation magic. &nbsp;It was as if it had been bleached. &nbsp;Despite this fact, the Magic Stone contained an ominous power. &nbsp;Arpte let out a rotten smile as he looked at it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“As expected, she left behind her ambition for the future generations. &nbsp;It really is an ending befitting a traditional hero’s story.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He used his Read All Creation ability, and he could see a magic circle that could open a tunnel to the Demonic god. &nbsp;Artpe had to acknowledge it. &nbsp;The previous Demon King had been tenacious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Artpe’s party hadn’t noticed it, some unsuspecting person might have picked it up. &nbsp;It probably would have happened after several hundred or thousand years from now. &nbsp;An unsuspecting person would call back the Demonic energy back into this world. &nbsp; Or maybe, the surviving force of the previous Demon King would continue their research. &nbsp;In the end, they would find this stone, and they would fulfill the dying wish of the previous Demon King. &nbsp;Something dramatic might have happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Of course, we've gained enormous power now. &nbsp;We can reverse the magic. &nbsp;It’ll be possible for us to cross into the other world.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Dungeon? &nbsp;It’s a Dungeon?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Shit. &nbsp;In the end, we are going to go fight the Demonic god? &nbsp;Really?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She had been in high spirits up until now as she fought, and the thought of a new Dungeon made Maetel feel excited. &nbsp;On the other hand, the other party members turned pale at his words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had fought the current Demon King, the Fragment of the Demonic god and the previous Demon King. &nbsp;Now he wanted them to go fight the Demonic god!? &nbsp;Artpe smirked when he saw the appalled expression on the faces of his party members. &nbsp;He gripped the Magic Stone then he let it go. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he did this, the Magic Stone just turned into a regular Magic Stone containing overwhelming amount of Mana.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah······.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“W... what did you do?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It will be too annoying.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Artpe’s face scrunched up as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We finally got rid of all the enemies in this world, yet we have to go to a new world to fight a different enemy? Is this a joke? &nbsp;We aren’t from some martial race.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But…. &nbsp; If we don’t get rid of the source of trouble….”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A new source of trouble always arises with time. &nbsp;If we try to eliminate each problem that arises, who is going to feed the cows?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Artpe had completely wiped away the Demonic energy, but he couldn’t guarantee that humans in the future generations might research a similar energy as the Demonic energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was just a hypothetical question. &nbsp;What would happen if Artpe’s party went over to the other world, and they erased the Demonic god from existence? &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Would all strife within the world come to an end? &nbsp;Would humanity find a happy ending? &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No way. &nbsp;For a different reason, a great villain would appear in the future, and there will come a time when this great villain would fight against humanity. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Strife can arise at any moment in time. &nbsp;That is why we should leave this Demonic god and the other world to the future hero.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your explanation sounds very plausible, but in the end, you just don’t want to fight any more ...?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was the correct answer. &nbsp;If left alone, it wasn’t as if the other side could invade this world. &nbsp;There was no need to cross over to the other world. &nbsp;It was unnecessary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Still, his power of Revision was able to block the tunnel heading towards the other world. &nbsp;If someone capable of breaking open the tunnel appeared, it meant the person would already have enough power to cause trouble even without the help of the Demonic god. &nbsp;Artpe was fine if that happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I have no idea if this is alright!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah. &nbsp;I don’t know. &nbsp;If anyone really wants to go, I can send them there. &nbsp;Do you guys want to go?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had just erased the Record within the Magic Stone, yet Artpe declared in a confident manner. &nbsp;He had awakened to his 2nd stage of the Read All Creation ability. &nbsp;He had reached a domain that couldn’t be understood by his party members, and his party members were aware of this fact. &nbsp;If he said he could send them to the Demonic god, they didn’t doubt his words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was why everyone turned pale, and they shook their head from side to side. &nbsp;The only one that looked a bit regretful was Roa.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nyaa. &nbsp;I'll go later if I start craving for it. &nbsp;Nyaa-ah-ah.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What is this? &nbsp;There is this unbearable feeling of ickiness…..”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“All hero’s story is like that. &nbsp;The story that comes afterwards always leaves a bad taste in one’s mouth. &nbsp;If we don’t leave behind a single seed of misfortune and uneasiness, our future generations will have nothing to do. &nbsp;It’ll spice up their lives.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone gave up on arguing with Artpe at that point in time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes. &nbsp;This is like you, Artpe.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So we really were successful in finding peace without sacrificing an ally. &nbsp;This will hold true until one of you stab each other in the back…..”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The only thing left is to settle our balance with Artpe-nim.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As expected of Artpe’s party members, they were going out of their way to plant the seed of uneasiness within him. &nbsp;He flicked the forehead of all his party members, then he received Etna from Regina.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I protected all of them. &nbsp;It was tough.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, yes. &nbsp;You worked hard. ······it seems she’s in a critical state..”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Etna was able to uncover Nanarai’s Innate ability before it was too late. &nbsp;However, as a price, most of her Spirit energy had been consumed. &nbsp; She was out cold right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Artpe quickly filled up her Mana, but she needed to be conscious to be able to turn the Mana into Spirit energy. &nbsp;If she was left alone, there was a possibility that she would never wake up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That damn sunbae. &nbsp;He really is causing me trouble until the end.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Etna was no longer in peril. &nbsp;The [Reclamation] simply returned everything back to its original form. &nbsp;He had moved beyond that power. &nbsp;He could use [Revise] to get anything he wanted. &nbsp;In Artpe’s current state, he was able to convert Mana into Spirit energy. &nbsp;It was a task that was easier than killing the Demon King Ganet Orzodia.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That power…..”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Regina finally recognized the power awakened within Artpe. &nbsp;Her eyes had turned round. &nbsp;Artpe smirked as he brought a finger to his lips in a shhh gesture. &nbsp;After the Mana around Etna was turned into Spirit energy, he filled Etna’s body with it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Kuh-hoohk······.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Etna coughed as she opened her eyes. &nbsp;Her two eyes took in Artpe, who had a playful look on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Artpe······ Did we win?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We won.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is it over?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It is over.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Good······ &nbsp;Amazing. &nbsp;You are the best.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She had inwardly thought that she would never wake up again. &nbsp;However, it seemed Artpe had &nbsp;picked up her slack as he magnificently defeated their enemy. &nbsp;At Artpe’s words, Etna put on a faint smile as she planted a short kiss on his lips. &nbsp;Maetel became apoplectic when she saw this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“W...wait a moment. &nbsp;I’m the one that’s supposed to wrap things up with a kiss!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I already did it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oooooooooh! &nbsp;I knew I should have killed you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Maetel raged, but everyone just smirked as they looked on. &nbsp;The fact that she was able to get mad at such a simple thing brought home the fact that there was peacel now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Where?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Anywhere.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Artpe face was resolute as he answered the question. &nbsp;He spoke the dream he wanted as soon as he returned to the past. &nbsp; He truly looked determined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll go to a place where it is possible to set up a dairy farm.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><br></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Twenty years passed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The world was greeted with a tremendous upheaval. &nbsp;The Demons had been changed back into humans. &nbsp;The Demon realm and human realm was combined into one. &nbsp;The truth behind the Demon race was revealed. &nbsp;The Demons were an existence born through human greed. &nbsp;It really brought home the fact that it was good to trust no one but yourself. &nbsp;That was how everyone felt when they learned the truth of the matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were some portion of the Demon turned humans that had refused to accept reality, so they had caused disturbances in various locations. &nbsp;However, the humans had grown stronger in the fight against the Demon race. &nbsp;They were swift and ruthless in putting down such series of attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Peace had returned. &nbsp;If one actually looked closer, one would realize that not much had changed. &nbsp;At the very least the Demon King and his underlings were all gone. &nbsp;They no longer appeared in this world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The King of Diaz Silpennon had applied himself in earnest to become a statesman. &nbsp;Through his first Queen Leseti, he was able to create an order of loyal knights. &nbsp;He was able to work with the holy nation of Paladia through his second Queen Aria. &nbsp;He was able to establish a state religion. &nbsp; As high as his level was, Silpennon received as much love and support from the populace. &nbsp;He had protected his nation, and he had protected his people. &nbsp;If one thought about his vocation as a thief, it was a truly ironic development.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The empire of Zard was successful in becoming the top power of the continent. &nbsp;In truth, Zard had wanted to bring Diaz under his flag too. &nbsp;However, Silpennon had been a member of the hero’s party, and he was one of the strongest people on this continent. &nbsp;Zard knew this truth, so he didn’t dare mess with Silpennon. &nbsp;Of course, one couldn’t predict what would happen after Silpennon’s death. &nbsp;At the very least, the two nations would maintain a friendly relationship while Silpennon was alive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The hero’s party was dismissed, and they went immediately into retirement. &nbsp;Those that were friendly or hostile towards the hero’s party didn’t search them out. &nbsp;Even if the hero’s party could be found, they knew the hero’s party couldn’t be moved to any side. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was how Artpe finally achieved his 200 year old dream. &nbsp;He was able to live the life of a dairy farmer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Husband~.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You are giving me goosebumps!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the morning, Artpe immediately jumped up from his bed when Maetel whispered in his ear. His reaction speed was almost miraculous. &nbsp;Maetel, who had called out to him, giggled. &nbsp;She took pleasure in his reaction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How can you still be so embarrassed?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I told you not to call me by that title.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But husband is husband.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Did I deny that? &nbsp;I just don’t like hearing it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he went along with her antics by being sweet, he knew that a second round of strenuous activities would follow. &nbsp;It would be more intense than last night. &nbsp;His experience with her for the past 20 years made him aware as to what would happen, so he purposefully replied in a gruff manner. &nbsp;He got up from the bed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What about Sienna?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“She went along with Vadinet to see Oompa. &nbsp;Etna went to the field…. &nbsp;I think Mycenae is still asleep.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Oompa was the name of the dairy cow they were raising. &nbsp;Of course, they didn’t have just one cow. &nbsp; It started out with Oompa. &nbsp;Then it went from Oompa II to Oompa Loompa. &nbsp;They were raising a total of 23 dairy cows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If Mycenae is asleep, it means there’s no one else that’ll bother me for a while. &nbsp;······I can go back to sleep.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes. &nbsp;Let’s sleep together. &nbsp;We should start making our third child.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“······no. &nbsp;I forgot. &nbsp;I really have to go to work right now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Usually, feelings change over time. &nbsp;He had assumed that her excessive and heavy love towards him would change to a different emotion after twenty years, but it seemed this didn’t apply to Maetel. &nbsp;Maetel stated that she was half-joking, but she was half-serious about having another child. &nbsp;He flicked her forehead before he exited the house. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No. &nbsp;Before he did that….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah. &nbsp;Call the children. &nbsp;It is annoying, but they have to study magic today. &nbsp;We’ll start the class as soon as I get done with the morning tasks.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was safe to assume that Artpe’s children would be able to live a peaceful life. &nbsp;However, peace had to be protected with power. &nbsp;Artpe rotated with his wife to teach the children how to protect themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, husband~”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ooh-ahhhhh!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Goosebump appeared on his skin when he was confronted with her last ambush attack. &nbsp;Artpe exited the house as if he was running away. Maetel once again let out a warm laughter as she watched his back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She made a milkshake that she’ll deliver to Artpe later on, then she made food for the children. &nbsp;After she place the food on the table, she entered the room where all the children were sleeping. &nbsp;She planned on waking them up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It is time to get up, children.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were a total of seven children. &nbsp;Maetel had born two children. &nbsp;One was male, and the other was female. &nbsp;Vadinet had born a cute daughter. &nbsp; A pair of energetic male twins were born by Etna. &nbsp;Mycenae had given birth to a half-elf son. &nbsp;Lastly, Sienna gave birth to a little princess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, they didn’t wake up just because she had called out to them once. &nbsp;Maetel put strength in her stomach as she let out a fierce shout. &nbsp;It was the former hero’s War Cry. &nbsp;Of course, the children would wake up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mom! &nbsp;You used War Cry again! &nbsp;The kids will cry!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The first born was Hirtiga. &nbsp;He represented the other children as he protested her method of waking them up. &nbsp;Maetel just let out a bright smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It is time for you guys to eat, children. &nbsp;Today your father will teach you magic.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ooh ooh. &nbsp;Dad is the hardest teacher. &nbsp;I just want to raise Oompa Loompa. &nbsp;I want to live my whole life on the farm. &nbsp;I’ll be satisfied with that life.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Daddy said we need strength to protect the peace, idiot oppa.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The children forgot the complaints they had when getting up. &nbsp;They started talking loudly to each other as they walked past mother Maetel into the living room. &nbsp; Maetel followed behind the children. &nbsp;There was a satisfied smile on her smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes. &nbsp;This is it. &nbsp;I’m fine with this. &nbsp;······there is no need to rewind it again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The past 20 years had been peaceful, and it had been picture perfect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In that span of time, she hadn’t used the 2nd stage of her Innate ability. &nbsp;Not even once.</span></p>
