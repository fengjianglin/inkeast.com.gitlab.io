 <p style="text-align: justify">New of good deeds invariably remain unnoticed, while news of bad deeds spread like wildfire. The lives of the Dawn Sect cultivators had recently been dry and dreary and filled only with matters pertaining to cultivation. Every day that passed was the same, and there were hardly any surprises or exciting news. Thus, even though what happened between Yu Wanrou and Qin Lingyu could hardly be considered a bad deed, the news of what had occurred still became the talk of the table in the blink of an eye.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">In fact, by the afternoon, practically the entire sect had been apprised of the “wrestling match” between Qin Lingyu and Yu Wanrou on his bed that lasted the entire morning.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Different people reacted differently – some with admiration and envy, some with remorse, some with hatred, and yet others with a look of realization.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">The truth of the matter was that everyone had begun to suspect that there was something going on between Qin Lingyu and Yu Wanrou ever since they had returned to the sect from their travels. However, there was still a marriage arrangement between Qin Lingyu and Jun Xiaomo at that time, and there were also no explicit signs that there was anything intimate going on between Qin Lingyu and Yu Wanrou. Thus, most people shelved their thoughts there and then, treating their thoughts as no more than mere baseless suspicions.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">In fact, there were even some people who felt that Qin Lingyu would be far better off with Yu Wanrou at that time. After all, regardless of how good Jun Xiaomo’s backing was, she was no more than a crippled cultivator. and she was bound to end up being a burden to Qin Lingyu.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">That said, these perspectives about Jun Xiaomo changed after Jun Xiaomo’s stellar results from the Secondary Inter-Sect Competition. Who would still dare to label Jun Xiaomo as a piece of trash after her incredible performance? Had anyone ever seen a “piece of trash” lead a team of disciples to claim victory in the group battles against all odds?!</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Thus, by this point in time, most people had changed their minds and found that Qin Lingyu’s rescission of the marriage arrangement with Jun Xiaomo was a terrible slip-up on his part. However, most people kept these thoughts to themselves and nobody spoke much about it.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">That said, now that Qin Lingyu and Yu Wanrou had officially come together, the disciples who were secretly fond of Qin Lingyu or Yu Wanrou found themselves indignant at the latest development; while others sported the attitude of a passive onlooker as they began to compare Yu Wanrou with Jun Xiaomo.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">When they looked at both Yu Wanrou and Jun Xiaomo side by side, these disciples found themselves agreeing that Yu Wanrou was beneath Jun Xiaomo in terms of both charms as well as looks. Could Qin Lingyu have just let go of his big prize while grabbing at trifles?</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“You can’t say it like that. Qin Lingyu and Yu Wanrou have experienced several hardships together after all. How could Jun Xiaomo match up to the relationship and bond that they have with each other? Furthermore, Yu Wanrou’s abilities aren’t too bad either. She’s quite a good match for martial brother Qin.” A young female cultivator pouted her lips as she spoke. Her tender face revealed much about her youthful naivete – in her eyes, the relationship between Yu Wanrou and Qin Lingyu was true love. It was what she yearned for as well.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“That’s right, they’d gone through thick and thin together. Perhaps they’ve even already gone through ‘thick and thin’ in bed together a long time ago! I mean, the marriage arrangement between Jun Xiaomo and Qin Lingyu had only been rescinded a short time ago. How could Qin Lingyu and Yu Wanrou already be tussling together?” The person who had just chimed in was a male cultivator who had secretly been fond of Yu Wanrou. His spiel was filled with sour jealousy because his dream girl just been picked up by someone.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“Hmph, postulations! Do you have any proof?!” The young female cultivator retorted in displeasure. She was unwilling to see the perfect picture of love in her mind be tainted by such slanderous accusations.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">The male cultivator coughed awkwardly. After some deliberation, he decided it would be wise not to press the issue and mention this any further.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">He knew that he did not have any hard evidence to prove his postulations. Furthermore, given Qin Lingyu identity, stature and abilities, he knew that Qin Lingyu was someone that he simply could not afford to cross at all. Thus, he decided that it would be prudent to keep his trap shut so as to minimize any possibilities of Qin Lingyu overhearing his baseless allegations and finding trouble with him.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">That said, there were few people who were as naïve as the young female cultivator in the spiritual cultivation world. Just like that male cultivator, most of the other people had already suspected that Qin Lingyu and Yu Wanrou had already had intimate relations with each other from a long time ago. It was just that no one had expressed their thoughts outwardly.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">One of the disciples who found Qin Lingyu an immense eyesore was none other than Wei Gaolang. To begin with, Wei Gaolang was already displeased with Qin Lingyu because of what happened with Jun Xiaomo. Then, given how Qin Lingyu’s dear master had time and again forced the Heavenly Peak into a corner during the Secondary Inter-Sect Competition, his displeasure had already burgeoned well into hatred.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Today, when Wei Gaolang overheard the gossip that Qin Lingyu and Yu Wanrou had tussled with each other in bed, he immediately rushed back to the Heavenly Peak. He ran straight to Jun Xiaomo’s abode, found Jun Xiaomo in her courtyard, and immediately began recounting what he had heard to Jun Xiaomo with indignation.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“They must have been seeing each other secretly since such a long time ago! Otherwise, how else could they have been rolling about in bed with each other within just two months of the rescission of the marriage arrangement!” Wei Gaolang cried out with fury.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Jun Xiaomo smiled faintly and listened patiently to Wei Gaolang’s complaints, before she poured Wei Gaolang a cup of tea and set it before him, “You must be tired from all that talking. Come, have a sip of the tea to quench your thirst.”</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Jun Xiaomo never drank much tea in her previous life. That said, having known Ye Xiuwen once more in this life, she had begun to learn from Ye Xiuwen the art of appreciating tea as well.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">The clear and pleasant aroma of the tea was so refreshing that it seemed to suffuse through one’s body and purge the frustrations and dreariness in a person’s heart.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“Martial sister, why aren’t you angry at all!” Wei Gaolang looked at the cup of tea in front of his eyes as he cried out in dismay.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Having complained for almost half a day, he found that he was the only one infuriated. His martial sister remained completely unperturbed by this news, as though she were not involved in this matter at all.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Jun Xiaomo smiled to herself as she quipped in a lighthearted fashion, “Why should I be angry? Wouldn’t I be tormenting myself instead if I get mad at a person who’s no longer related to me?”</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Besides, she had already tasted Qin Lingyu’s betrayal on several occasions in her previous life, and every last bit of her feelings for Qin Lingyu had remained buried in that dark and dank dungeon that she had spent the end of her previous life in.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Today, as long as Qin Lingyu refrained from provoking her, she would be willing to temporarily shelve her vengeance against him and ignore him. Otherwise…</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Wei Gaolang shuddered slightly. He suddenly discovered that his martial sister Xiaomo’s smile had become particularly…frigid. It was nearly akin to the frostiness of the Thousand Year Frost.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify"><em>Martial sister actually minds all of this, right? She must just find it difficult to speak about it.</em> Wei Gaolang’s heart felt pangs of sourness. Apart from his ever-growing compassion towards Jun Xiaomo, his hatred towards Qin Lingyu and Yu Wanrou burgeoned yet even more.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">If Jun Xiaomo could hear Wei Gaolang’s thoughts right now, she might very well have rapped him hard on the head.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Could his martial sister be so useless in his heart?! Would she be wasting her heart and soul on such a wastrel of a man?!</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Fortunately, Jun Xiaomo was unable to hear the voices of Wei Gaolang’s heart, and she continued to sip at her tea with a calm state of mind.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Qin Lingyu was unaware that his moment of indulgence and extended period of impassioned behaviour had resulted in such proliferate rumours spreading throughout the Sect.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">The truth of the matter was that the Mesmerizing Blossom Pill’s effects had subsided towards the end of the morning, and Qin Lingyu had already come to his senses. However, having tasted the goodness of such a pleasurable experience, he naturally found it difficult to let go of the immense ecstasy accompanying the Mesmerizing Blossom Pill’s effects. Thus, he continued to clutch tightly to Yu Wanrou’s waist as they tussled for another few rounds in bed. Finally, when Yu Wanrou could no longer take it, and in consideration of the fact that she had not consumed anything since the morning, she began to beg Qin Lingyu to spare her.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">It was a fortunate thing that Qin Lingyu had already attained the Foundation Establishment stage of cultivation. Otherwise, he could very well have perished in bed under the effects of Yu Wanrou’s two invigorating medicines.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">After Yu Wanrou tidied up her appearances for a little bit, she began to make her way over to the Sect’s dining hall together with Qin Lingyu. They had arrived slightly late, and there were already not many people left in the dining hall. Despite that, Qin Lingyu and Yu Wanrou could still sense that several people had cast them surreptitious and discreet glances.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“The rumours must be true. See, they’ve come to the dining hall together.”</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“That’s right. I can even see the love bites on Yu Wanrou’s body. Tsk tsk…how exciting must their tussle have been…”</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">These disciples had intentionally lowered their volumes and whispered to each other. However, Qin Lingyu was already in the Foundation Establishment stage of cultivation, and his divine sense was far stronger than the average disciple’s. Thus, how could these exchanges between the disciples elude his ears?</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">His expression immediately turned a sickly green, and he ferociously clenched his fists within his sleeves.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“Lingyu…” Yu Wanrou’s meridians had undergone the baptism of her spirit spring waters, and her senses were far stronger than the average disciple’s senses as well. Thus, she had also picked up on what the disciples had whispered to each other earlier as well.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">But she pretended not to have heard it. She simply put on a concerned look as she tugged gently at Qin Lingyu’s sleeves.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Qin Lingyu’s arm stiffened. He had the sudden urge to push Yu Wanrou to the side. He had good reason to believe that she had just schemed against him.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">He was not a fool after all. If not for the fact that he had fallen prey to her scheme, why would he have done something so uncharacteristic of him?! He was the Sect Leader’s First-Seat Disciple! How far had he fallen to become the talk of the table during lunchtime?!</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Qin Lingyu was a person who viewed his image and reputation with the utmost importance. This was why he had always been unwilling to make his relationship with Yu Wanrou public. After all, he firmly believed that he would have the ability to attract and marry a far stronger female cultivator with much better stature and backing than Yu Wanrou. But now that Yu Wanrou had inextricably tied herself down to him, it was going to be far more difficult for him to shed this burden weighing him down in future.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Thus, he was infuriated. Not only by the fact that he had just been schemed against, but by the fact that he was now inextricably tied together with Yu Wanrou.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">On the other hand, Yu Wanrou was incredibly delighted. She knew that her actions last night had brought to her some unexpected rewards – the fruit of her labour was far greater than she had expected.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">With this, it was going to be far more difficult for Qin Lingyu to cast her aside and enter the Limitless Sect alone.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">She was now one step closer to her goals.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Qin Lingyu knew full well that now was not the time to explode at Yu Wanrou. At the very least, he could not afford to be given both labels of an “impassioned man” and a “heartless traitor” at this critical juncture.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Thus, he fervently suppressed the indignation that was swelling up in his chest and used the calmest tone of voice he could muster to mutter to Yu Wanrou in a soft voice, “Let’s talk about this after lunch.”</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Yu Wanrou responded with a simple “Mm.” Then, when Qin Lingyu lowered his head, a smile immediately crept up the corner of her lips.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">She knew what exactly Qin Lingyu wanted to talk about. However, she did not believe that Qin Lingyu would be able to escape her grasp after one night of passion under the effects of the Mesmerizing Blossom Pill.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Qin Lingyu would only grow more and more addicted to the intense pleasure and satisfaction brought by the Mesmerizing Blossom Pill, and he would personally fall deeper and deeper in love with her, until he was finally subject to her ever beck and call.</p>
