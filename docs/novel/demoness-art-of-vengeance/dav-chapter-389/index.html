 <p style="text-align: justify">“Cough, cough. How long do you intend to hug each other for?” An old, wizened voice echoed from behind Jun Xiaomo, causing Jun Xiaomo to stiffen up and blush slightly. She pushed Rong Ruihan gently, and Rong Ruihan finally released her from his embrace.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“Old Man Chi.” Jun Xiaomo greeted somewhat awkwardly.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“Master.” Rong Ruihan addressed Old Man Chi as well.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“Hmph.” Old Man Chi snorted as he glared at Rong Ruihan – he was the one who had informed Rong Ruihan of Jun Xiaomo’s whereabouts to begin with. But when he saw Rong Ruihan and Jun Xiaomo locked in a tight embrace, he couldn’t help but feel embittered in his heart as well.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">It would seem that he had just invited yet another troublesome love rival of his great-grandson to join the fray. What should he do?</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">The sprightly old man had arrived together with Old Man Chi. His heart was filled with displeasure at this sight as well. To his mind, Jun Xiaomo was already his disciple’s wife. The appearance of yet another love rival stepping between his disciple and his wife made it seem as though someone else was trying to take advantage of his disciple.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Most importantly, the person who was stepping between them was none other than Old Man Chi’s personal disciple!</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Glancing over, the sprightly old man couldn’t help but entertain with displeasure the thought that Jun Xiaomo and Rong Ruihan looked quite good together. Then, an idea struck him. Suppressing the disdain in his heart, he smiled faintly at Jun Xiaomo and quipped, “Xiaomo, is the child in yer womb fine now?”</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“Child?” Rong Ruihan was taken aback, and he glanced down to Jun Xiaomo’s lower abdomen.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Jun Xiaomo didn’t notice the strange expression on Rong Ruihan’s face. She lowered her face and rubbed her lower abdomen gently before smiling softly and radiantly, “I’m feeling much better after consuming the Rainbow Lotus Flower’s seeds. Thank you, Master…”</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Jun Xiaomo looked up and gave the sprightly old man a nod of appreciation.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">On the other hand, Rong Ruihan found the warm, pleased smile incredibly harsh and glaring to his eyes. He had never expected to hear such an outrageous news the moment he was reunited with Jun Xiaomo.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">If the child wasn’t his, then it could only mean that it was Ye Xiuwen’s child.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify"><em>What a joke. Here I am, worrying for Xiaomo’s safety, rushing here to check on her despite the fact that I’m still recovering from my injuries, yet there she is, already with somebody else’s child. Am I no more than an accessory to her now?</em></p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Rong Ruihan’s forehead throbbed slightly, and his eyes grew slightly bloodshot. He tightened his fists, and then loosened them again. Finally, suppressing the roiling fury and indignation in his heart, he flicked his sleeves and stormed off without another word, brushing gently past Jun Xiaomo.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Jun Xiaomo finally detected the peculiar expression in his eyes, and she thought to grab hold of his arm. Unfortunately, her fingers merely slid past the corner of his sleeves.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Somewhat dumbfounded, Jun Xiaomo watched as Rong Ruihan stormed away. Her heart wrung in pain, and she lowered her head and began to mock herself contemptuously.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">She shouldn’t be expecting too much more than this, should she? After all, she was already with Ye Xiuwen’s child. This outcome might be best for everyone around.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">As Rong Ruihan stormed out of the room, he coincidentally bumped into Ye Xiuwen who was returning from outside. His bloodshot eyes deepened even more in the instant he noticed Ye Xiuwen.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Ye Xiuwen’s existence was a mockery to everything he had done. In fact, maybe Jun Xiaomo had never needed him to do so much for her to begin with.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Rong Ruihan paused momentarily and glanced coldly at Ye Xiuwen, before storming off in silence once more.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">On the other hand, Ye Xiuwen thought that this was a mere manifestation of the enmity between love rivals, and he didn’t think too much of Rong Ruihan’s behaviour. Thus, he continued ahead and walked into the great hall.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“Old Man Chi, Master.” Ye Xiuwen greeted the two elderly folks as he entered the great hall, before making his way over to Jun Xiaomo’s side.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Jun Xiaomo was staring at the ground, sullen and silent. It was only when she noticed a familiar silhouette enter her peripheral vision that she looked back up again.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“What’s the matter?” Ye Xiuwen lifted his hands and massaged the side of Jun Xiaomo’s eyes. He could see the hurt and complex emotions roiling in the depths of Jun Xiaomo’s eyes.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“Nothing much.” Jun Xiaomo forced a smile to her face as she placed an arm around Ye Xiuwen’s waist and buried her head into his chest.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">She knew that Rong Ruihan had sacrificed a lot for her, but it was a fact that she was bearing Ye Xiuwen’s child right now. This meant that she was fated to spend the rest of her life with Ye Xiuwen going forward.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Accordingly, she was fated to be unable to reciprocate Rong Ruihan’s intentions, and she also had no choice but to discard these unnecessary emotions of hers.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Ye Xiuwen patted Jun Xiaomo’s head. His eyes now gleamed with understanding as to why Rong Ruihan had stormed out of the room earlier with a disdainful expression on his face.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">The sprightly old man and Old Man Chi exchanged awkward glances at each other, only to realize that their presence was no longer needed here. After all, what were two old fogeys like them doing interfering with the passion and vigor between youngsters?</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Thus, both old men coughed dryly as they motioned to take their leave.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Just then, a Chi clansman burst into the great hall and hurriedly addressed Old Man Chi, “Clan Head, something has happened in the dungeon!”</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Old Man Chi’s spirits immediately tensed up as he responded, “Something happened? Explain yourself?”</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“You…you’d best take a look for yourself.” The clansman found it difficult to describe the situation to Old Man Chi.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Old Man Chi furrowed his brows and made a beeline towards the dungeon. At the same time, the sprightly old man, Ye Xiuwen and Jun Xiaomo followed closely behind him.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">As soon as they arrived in the dungeon and saw the sight within, Old Man Chi and the sprightly old man immediately drew a cold breath. At the same time, Ye Xiuwen turned around rapidly and covered Jun Xiaomo’s eyes immediately.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“Martial Brother Ye, what happened?” Jun Xiaomo asked in bewilderment.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Even though she was unable to see the sight within, the thick, nauseating stench of blood told her that it was a gory, grotesque sight within.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Jun Xiaomo patted Ye Xiuwen’s arms and persuaded, “Martial Brother Ye, it’s fine. Let me take a look.”</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">After all, Jun Xiaomo had seen all types of gory, grotesques sights in her two lifetimes’ worth of experience. Thus, her heart and mind were already prepared for the worst as soon as she detected the faint stench of blood.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“You’re with child right now. It’s best if you don’t see such things.” Ye Xiuwen muttered to Jun Xiaomo with a soft voice.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“It’s fine.” Jun Xiaomo patted Ye Xiuwen’s arm once more, before slowly peeling his hands away.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">As light poured into her eyes once again, the first thing that Jun Xiaomo saw was the gory sight within the dungeon. A wooden statue separating the two prison cells had been broken in pieces, and there were bits of broken teeth on the remains of the statue. Wei Xingping had somehow found his way to Zhuang Lenghui’s cell, and he lay lifelessly on the ground, eyes bloodshot, heaving his final breaths. His surroundings were filled with bits and pieces of what used to be parts of a human body, as well as streaks of dried blood that painted the walls and the floor of the dungeon a dark red hue.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify"><em>Urgh…</em> Several Chi clansmen immediately ran back out of the dungeon to throw up.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">On the other hand, Jun Xiaomo didn’t throw up. Instead, she simply furrowed her brows and stretched her lips out into a thin grimace.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“Please go out if you can’t bear the sight.” Ye Xiuwen muttered warmly to Jun Xiaomo.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Shaking her head, she smiled faintly to Ye Xiuwen, “I’m fine. Don’t worry, Martial Brother.”</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“The person who perished must be that young gal surnamed Zhuang, right?” The sprightly old man asked with gusto. He had never visited the dungeon before. But, seeing that the two adjoining cells only contained Wei Xingping, he could already hazard a guess that the other person held captive in this cell should be none other than Zhuang Lenghui.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“It’s indeed that gal named Zhuang. She must have been blown to bits by Wei Xingping.” Old Man Chi explained placidly.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“That’s strange. Old Man Chi, didn’t ye already beat Wei Xingping down to his final breaths? His cultivation level had even fallen to the Golden Core stage of cultivation. How could he possibly have blown that Zhuang brat to pieces?” The sprightly old man rubbed his chin as he thought aloud.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“You might have to ask your dear disciple in this regard.” Old Man Chi cast a glance at Ye Xiuwen.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Ye Xiuwen curled his lips into a faint smile and admitted, “I was responsible for this. All I did was to give her a taste of her own medicine.”</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“What do you mean?” The sprightly old man was hooked by Ye Xiuwen’s enigmatic explanation.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“Zhuang Lenghui intended to vie for the Rainbow Lotus Flower’s seeds against us, and she thought to pit Wei Xingping against us and kill with a borrowed knife. More accurately speaking, I had never killed Wei Xingping’s disciple, Zou Zilong. Back then, when I tossed him back to the Zephyr Sect’s disciples, he was still alive and well. When I found out that he had perished, the only conclusion I could draw was that Zhuang Lenghui had killed him. What I’ve done right now was only to reveal the truth to Wei Xingping, as well as provide him with a recovery pill that would temporarily restore his abilities.”</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Ye Xiuwen explained with a matter-of-fact tone of voice, as though he were completely disjointed from the perfectly pitched scheme.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">The sprightly old man smacked his head and remarked, “Ye brat-…ye…what do ye want yer master to say? With this, we’ve most certainly placed ourselves on the top of the Zephyr Sect’s list. Zhuang Lenghui’s father will never take this lying down!”</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Ye Xiuwen remained silent. To his mind, it was only a matter of time before they became sworn enemies with the Zephyr Sect either. He had never thought of running or hiding to begin with, since the Zephyr Sect’s actions had thoroughly stirred his wrath.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“Alright, there’s no need to worry. With the Chi Clan’s abilities backing you, do you really have to fear a measly Zephyr Sect?” Old Man Chi laughed aloud, “Old fogey, you’re being far too stern and serious here. It’s a surprise your disciple doesn’t take after your boring old personality. An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth – that’s the only way to live enjoyably and without regrets. I approve of his personality! Hahahaha…”</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Having just been forced to swallow his words, the sprightly old man glared furiously at Old Man Chi.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Didn’t he know just how powerful the Chi Clan was? The sprightly old man was simply displeased that the number of favours he owed to Old Man Chi was simply increasing by the minute.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“However, you’ve got to inform us before doing such things in future. Wei Xingping’s abilities aren’t weak. It would be a problem if he took the opportunity to escape as well. The consequences could be dire.” Old Man Chi patted Ye Xiuwen’s shoulders as he chided.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“Understood. Senior Chi makes sense. Junior will take Senior’s guidance to heart.” Ye Xiuwen bowed obsequiously towards Old Man Chi.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">The sprightly old man snorted with displeasure. The thought of his disciple complying with Old Man Chi’s instructions filled his heart with disdain.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Ye Xiuwen smiled placidly as he shut his eyes and did his best to conceal the sullenness in his heart.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Truth be told, the recovery pill he had given to Wei Xingping wasn’t something good either. After all, such pills with enabled a person to temporarily regain his abilities would only give rise to a commensurately powerful backlash once its effects wore off. This was the reason why Wei Xingping was lying motionless on the ground right now.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">He would never let Wei Xingping escape the dungeon alive.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Wei Xingping knew this as well. However, he still chose to consume the pill because he desired to personally kill his disciple’s murderer before she was rescued by the Zephyr Sect.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">He had achieved his goal of exacting vengeance, and there were no longer any regrets in his heart.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Ye Xiuwen patted Jun Xiaomo’s shoulders, “Let’s go. It wouldn’t be good to remain here for too long.”</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Jun Xiaomo nodded her head.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Soon after leaving the dungeon, Jun Xiaomo stretch out her arm and gently held Ye Xiuwen’s right hand as she muttered, “Thank you, Martial Brother Ye.”</p>
