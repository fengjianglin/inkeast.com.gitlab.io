 <p style="text-align: justify">Under the cover of Jun Xiaomo’s Invisibility Talismans, Yu Wanrou was completely oblivious to the fact that there were now several additional tails following closely behind her.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Truth be told, if not for the fact that Qin Lingyu had stumbled to Jun Xiaomo some time ago, Yu Wanrou might well have forgotten about Jun Xiaomo’s existence altogether. To her mind, she had already left Jun Xiaomo far behind her in the dust, and Jun Xiaomo was no longer worth her consideration at all.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“Wanrou, are you hungry? Have something to eat.” A well-built, handsome male cultivator retrieved a pack of dry rations from his Interspatial Ring and handed it to Yu Wanrou.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“Thanks, Brother Hui.” Yu Wanrou smiled sweetly at him as she received the dry rations and began to munch on it.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">The man instantly got felt numb all over from the coquettish manner in which Yu Wanrou had thanked him, and he couldn’t help but wonder whether he would be so lucky to sneak off with Yu Wanrou to a hidden place tonight to engage in a session of dual cultivation.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">The other male cultivators around noticed his interaction with Yu Wanrou as well, and they couldn’t help but cast looks of envy and jealousy at him.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">That’s right. The men surrounding Yu Wanrou were no longer men of a single sect. Her harem of men was already taking form, and this was the beginning of her massive following of men.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Yu Wanrou had still ended up treading the same path as she did in her previous life, relying on the draw of her spectral demiplane as well as her dual cultivation technique to command an entire following of male cultivators behind her. Naturally, her following included the Du Clan Head’s own son, Du Yongxu.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">After all, was there really any man out there unwilling to pass up on the opportunity to improve their cultivation by leaps and bounds while indulging in the ecstasy of carnal relations? Even if this meant that they would have to share a single lady with other men, they were still willing to accept this.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Furthermore, Yu Wanrou possessed spiritual waters within her spectral demiplane that enabled their injuries to recover incredibly quickly. Having a small bottle of these spiritual waters was akin to possessing hundreds of superior medicinal pills. This was something that one could only dream of – only a fool would think to reject such an amazing opportunity.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Naturally, Yu Wanrou’s expectations of her following of men were incredibly high as well. First and foremost, the men must be handsome, charming, and possess an exquisite, dignified disposition. Then, they must also possess both spectacular cultivation abilities as well as stature and backing. Lastly, she required that they remain completely loyal to her to the exclusion of all other women.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Men like Qin Lingyu who got irretrievably injured were immediately discarded by Yu Wanrou without any hesitation whatsoever.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">To Yu Wanrou’s mind, Qin Lingyu was already a thing of the past. After all, she had surrounded herself with a following of all types of handsome men now, so where was the need to go looking back to Qin Lingyu?</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">As night fell, Yu Wanrou and that male cultivator snuck out from their encampment and made their way to a secluded spot some distance away.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“It’s already so late. Where are they going?” Jun Xiaomo furrowed her brows as she gazed upon their backs.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Jun Xiaomo and the rest took turns to stand guard and observe Yu Wanrou’s entourage, and it happened to be Jun Xiaomo and Rong Ruihan’s turn to watch them through the night.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“I wonder if it’s because they’ve discovered traces of the Arcane Realm’s map. Come, let’s go take a look.” Rong Ruihan patted Jun Xiaomo’s shoulder as he whispered back.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Jun Xiaomo nodded and slipped off into the darkness together with Rong Ruihan.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">After Yu Wanrou and the other male cultivator travelled some distance into the wilderness, they darted behind a massive stone. Within moments, they were all over each other, taking off each other’s clothes and devouring each other’s lips as they moaned and groaned in tandem.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Jun Xiaomo: ……</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Rong Ruihan: ……</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Alright, they had truly underestimated Yu Wanrou’s bottom line. Just some days ago, they had still witnessed how she was acting all coyly and coquettishly with Du Yongxu. Yet just a few days later, she was already tussling carnally with another male cultivator.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Most importantly, she had even deigned to do the deed in the wilderness filled with faint traces of miasma…</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“Let’s go. I don’t want to watch anymore. It’s glaring to the eyes.” Rong Ruihan patted Jun Xiaomo’s shoulder as he added, “You’re still with child too. We won’t want it to learn from such bad influence.”</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Jun Xiaomo snickered softly, “Alright, alright. How could it possibly know such things of carnal relations? Don’t speak of such nonsense.”</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Yu Wanrou and the man had obviously been holding it in for far too long, and they delved straight into the actual deed without much foreplay. Just as Jun Xiaomo and Rong Ruihan were exchanging their lighthearted banter, Yu Wanrou had already begun to moan at the top of her voice from behind the massive rock.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“Faster…faster…”</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Jun Xiaomo’s cheeks instantly burned up with a red hue.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">She recalled the things of her previous life, and she happened to lock eyes with Rong Ruihan as she cast him an awkward glance.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">In that moment, the atmosphere between them was sullen and still.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Jun Xiaomo’s heart skipped a beat. she immediately turned around, motioning to leave anxiously for fear that she might no longer be able to face Rong Ruihan normally if she continued to lock eyes awkwardly with Rong Ruihan.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">On the other hand, Rong Ruihan’s heart trembled slightly as soon as he noticed Jun Xiaomo’s reddened cheeks and anxious disposition. He quickly took a few steps forward, grabbed hold of Jun Xiaomo’s arm and pulled her to the side of another massive rock nearby.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Rong Ruihan covered Jun Xiaomo’s ears. In an instant, everything went silent, and the only thing Jun Xiaomo could hear was the heavy thumping of Rong Ruihan’s heart just beside her own ears.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Jun Xiaomo bit down on her lower lips and pushed Rong Ruihan slightly, “Let go. We should head back.”</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Rong Ruihan responded sullenly, “But I don’t feel like letting go.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Jun Xiaomo: ……</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Rong Ruihan’s eyes darkened even more when he swept his gaze across Jun Xiaomo’s slightly reddened lips.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">In the next instant, Rong Ruihan lifted Jun Xiaomo’s chin and swiftly delivered a firm kiss to her lips. Jun Xiaomo’s grip around his clothing tightened. The thought of pushing him away crossed her mind. Yet, in the face of his firm and slightly savage act, she found herself unable to do a single thing.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">After all, even if she did something, it would barely tickle Rong Ruihan.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Rong Ruihan’s kiss was tyrannical and forceful at the start, but it gradually became soft and protracted. As time went on, Jun Xiaomo began to immerse herself fully in the kiss, and the thought of pushing Rong Ruihan away was cast to the back of her mind.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">After some time, Rong Ruihan finally let go of Jun Xiaomo and gently rubbed her reddened lips.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Jun Xiaomo’s pupils trembled slightly as she opened her eyes.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Rong Ruihan caressed her cheeks, “Let’s go back. You’re still with child, so this is as far as I can go right now.”</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Jun Xiaomo immediately glared at Rong Ruihan – <em>What do you mean “as far as you can go right now”? What were you thinking of doing?!</em></p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">It was as though he simply assumed that she was willing to go further as well.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Rong Ruihan smiled indulgently and patted Jun Xiaomo’s head, before tugging at her arm and making their way back to their own encampment.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Jun Xiaomo struggled slightly, but she was unable to loosen Rong Ruihan’s grip on her hand.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify"><em>Forget it. I won’t be able to wrestle free of his grip no matter how hard I try.</em> Jun Xiaomo thought to herself with a slightly defeatist attitude as she continued to be plagued by the thoughts of the future.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Meanwhile, on the other side, Ye Xiuwen happened to awaken from his slumber at the very same moment that Jun Xiaomo and Rong Ruihan departed from the campsite.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">He knew that Jun Xiaomo and Rong Ruihan had left the campsite because they were tailing Yu Wanrou. However, he also knew that both Yu Wanrou and the man she was with were weaker than Jun Xiaomo and Rong Ruihan, so he was assured that Jun Xiaomo was going to be safe.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Thus, he decided not to follow after them.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Then, as soon as he saw Jun Xiaomo and Rong Ruihan return to the campsite hand in hand, Ye Xiuwen began to collect his divine sense and keep it under wraps once more.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">He didn’t know why he chose to do this.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">That said, he soon discovered that Jun Xiaomo’s lips were slightly reddened and swollen.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">As Jun Xiaomo drew closer back to their campsite, Ye Xiuwen also quickly collected all of his divine sense and pretended to still be asleep.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Thus, from start to end, Jun Xiaomo was completely oblivious to the fact that Ye Xiuwen had been awake and watching them.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Rong Ruihan patted Jun Xiaomo’s shoulder, “I’ll take care of the rest of the night. You’re still with child right now, so you should rest early.”</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Jun Xiaomo accepted his good intentions. Nodding her head, she retrieved a rug made of animal skin from her Interspatial Ring and laid down on it.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Gradually, her eyelids began to droop heavily, and she fell into a deep slumber before long.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Just beside her, Ye Xiuwen opened his eyes once more to watch her sleep. After an incredibly long time, he sighed with some measure of resignation and tousled her hair helplessly.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify"><em>Forget it. I’ll leave it be for now. Who else can I blame but myself for not having the ability to protect her?</em></p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Meanwhile, after Yu Wanrou managed to satiate her thirst, their entire entourage began to move with much more gusto as well. Just as Jun Xiaomo had guessed, Yu Wanrou managed to snag the map of the Arcane Realm like she did in her previous life. Naturally, she was only able to cross the innumerable hurdles protecting the map with the aid of her following of men.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Yu Wanrou was incredibly delighted, and she felt as though she were blessed by the gods. Not only had she transmigrated to this cultivation world, she was even blessed with a series of incredible opportunities.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Yu Wanrou picked up the map eagerly as she searched for the heart of the Arcane Realm – the means to seizing ownership of the entire Arcane Realm.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">If everything went according to plan, she would be able to obtain ownership of the Arcane Realm like she did in Jun Xiaomo’s previous life, and she would then use it as a springboard to ascend to the peak of the entire cultivation world.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Unfortunately, fate was going to rear its ugly head in just a moment.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">This was because Jun Xiaomo and the rest were following closely behind, and they, too, were eyeing the map of the Arcane Realm in her possession.</p>
