 <p style="text-align: justify">Thousands of miles away, back at the Zephyr Sect, Disciple Zhuang Lenghui’s identity token suddenly lost its luster and shattered into pieces in the instant that she was murdered. The other Zephyr Sect disciples who saw this immediately reported back to the Sect Elders. In turn, Zhuang Hongsheng also learnt about this in no time.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“Ye Xiuwen, Jun Xiaomo, I, Zhuang Hongsheng, will never let you off the hook! I’m going to make you pay, blood for blood!!!” Zhuang Hongsheng’s eyes were bloodshot and blazing with fiery rage as his aura instantly flourished, shattering all of the surrounding furniture, reducing them to nothing more than sawdust.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Zhuang Hongsheng knew that Ye Xiuwen and Jun Xiaomo’s entourage had captured Zhuang Lenghui. Over the last few days, he had been wracking his brains thinking of a feasible plan to save his daughter. Unfortunately, Zhuang Lenghui’s identity token had just been completely shattered.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">In the Zephyr Sect, the shattering of an identity token could only mean one thing – the owner of that identity token had perished through and through. Thus, the Zephyr Sect disciples immediately knew that Zhuang Lenghui died the moment her identity token shattered.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Zhuang Hongsheng didn’t know that the culprit for his daughter’s death was none other than Wei Xingping. Regardless, given his personality, he would still have blamed his daughter’s death on Ye Xiuwen and Jun Xiaomo even if he knew the truth behind her death. After all, had Ye Xiuwen and Jun Xiaomo not captured Zhuang Lenghui in the first place, she would never have been murdered by Wei Xingping.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Zhuang Hongsheng’s authority within the Zephyr Sect was arguably even higher than that which Wei Xingping held. Under his instructions, the Zephyr Sect disciples assembled in full strength within the short span of six hours’ time and they all began to make haste towards the Sunset Mountain Range.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">No matter the cost, they were hell bent on locating Ye Xiuwen and Jun Xiaomo and delivering the wrath of the entire Zephyr Sect for their transgressions.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Unfortunately for them, the Zephyr Sect’s response was already well within Old Man Chi’s calculations. Thus, the entire Chi Clan entourage was already gone by the time Zhuang Hongsheng and the rest arrived at the Sunset Mountain Range – not a single person was still around.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Truth be told, they knew full well that it was only going to be a matter of time before they faced each other in a full-on confrontation. That said, there was no rush for that right now. After all, the most crucial thing right now was to find a solution for the issue within Jun Xiaomo’s body. While Jun Xiaomo had already consumed the Rainbow Lotus Flower’s seeds, her body’s rejection of her child would still be an issue if they were unable to locate the Ninth-Grade Green Lotus Pill before she was due to give birth.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“Green Lotus Pill?” Jun Xiaomo furrowed her head. She did vaguely recall hearing the name of the pill before. Unfortunately, she couldn’t recall where exactly she had heard this name from.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“Has something happened to Xiaomo’s body?” Rong Ruihan walked into the room and his gaze immediately landed on both Jun Xiaomo and Ye Xiuwen.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Right now, Jun Xiaomo was leaning on Ye Xiuwen as they sat together. The atmosphere between them was so intimate that it was glaring to Rong Ruihan’s eyes.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Rong Ruihan’s gaze darkened slightly. Suppressing the disdain in his heart, Rong Ruihan walked over to Jun Xiaomo’s other side and sat down beside her silently.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Just some time ago, he had stormed off in rage after learning that Jun Xiaomo is expecting Ye Xiuwen’s child right now. However, after spending the next few days cooling his head off, he still decided to return to her side.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">This was the problem of being fond of a person for such a long time – it would become increasingly difficult to give up on and forget that person as time went on. In Rong Ruihan’s case, his feelings for Jun Xiaomo spanned across two entire lifetimes. One could only imagine just how difficult it could be to let her go just like that. In fact, given the kinds of troubles Jun Xiaomo was presently faced with, he found it all the more difficult to erase her from his mind.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Thus, he decided to return in the end.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Jun Xiaomo’s spirits tensed up for a moment, before relaxing once more.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">On the other hand, Ye Xiuwen appeared to turn a blind eye to Rong Ruihan’s existence. In fact, he consciously chose not to react even when Rong Ruihan sat beside Jun Xiaomo.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify"><em>Squeak squeak~</em> A tiny voice broke apart the tense atmosphere in the room. Chi Jingtian had once again turned into a little packrat and leapt into Jun Xiaomo’s arms, curling himself up into a ball comfortably as he swished his tail around.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify"><em>This is why I say that, among us three love rivals, it’s going to be easiest for me to get close to Xiaomo!</em> The little packrat squinted his eyes as he thought in delight and capitalized on his furry and cute appearances to gain an advantage over the other two.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Jun Xiaomo knew that the “little pet” in her bosom was a man. However, she couldn’t help but curl her lips up into a smile as she stretched out her hand and tickled the little packrat behind his ears.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">After all, that plump ball of fluff that was no more than the size of a fist was simply too adorable – she simply couldn’t bring herself to chase it away.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">The little packrat was incredibly delighted, and it wrapped its tiny paws around Jun Xiaomo’s fingers and refused to let go.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Old Man Chi noticed how his great-grandson had decidedly turned back into an obsequious little “pet”, and he glared at Chi Jingtian as the bulging veins on his forehead throbbed, “Grow up!”</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">The little packrat blinked twice as it returned an “innocent” look to Old Man Chi, as though pretending it had not heard a single thing he said.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Old Man Chi snorted once more, before looking away.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">With the short interruption by the little packrat, the tension in the air between Rong Ruihan, Jun Xiaomo and Ye Xiuwen subsided substantially. Rong Ruihan recalled what Old Man Chi had just mentioned some time ago, and he couldn’t help but press the point, “Master, what’s wrong with Xiaomo’s body now?”</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“This young gal’s body doesn’t really have an issue. The real issue lay with the child in her womb.” Old Man Chi stroked his beard as he explained.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“What do you mean?” Rong Ruihan furrowed his brows.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“Miss Jun possesses an acquired demonic body, while the fetus in her body possesses a spiritual constitution. As it grows, she will require the suffusion of more and more spiritual energy through her body. This process is incredibly debilitating to Miss Jun’s body. Back when you were still away, Miss Jun has already experienced a period of intense weakness. If not for the fact that Ye Xiuwen had managed to seize the Rainbow Lotus Flower’s seeds and fed them to her, Miss Jun’s life might already be at risk by now.” Old Man Chi explained.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Rong Ruihan was unaware of the complexities of her pregnancy, and he was slightly taken aback.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“Now that Miss Jun has consumed the Rainbow Lotus Flower’s seeds, her body is already much better. That said, the problem isn’t resolved yet. Unless we can find the Ninth-Grade Green Lotus Pill, it’s only going to be a matter of time before her body shows signs of rejection again. When that time comes, her life would be in danger once more.”</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Old Man Chi’s explanations caused Rong Ruihan’s eyebrows to furrow deeper and deeper, and he glanced over at Jun Xiaomo. Detecting a gaze landing on her body, Jun Xiaomo looked up and immediately locked eyes with Rong Ruihan.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Faint echoes of emotions rippled in her heart as soon as she noticed Rong Ruihan’s deep, abstruse gaze on her.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">She didn’t know what she should do. Thus, she smiled back faintly, as though reassuring him that everything would be alright.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Yet the faint smile of hers only served to tug powerfully at Rong Ruihan’s heartstrings. He recalled that their child in the previous life had failed to see the light of day, and if possible, he sincerely wished that Jun Xiaomo did not have to go through such pain and sorrow of losing a child ever again.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Thus, with a somewhat darkened, ashen gaze, he sighed briefly, before patting Jun Xiaomo’s head as he reassured her, “Don’t worry. We’ll do our best to locate the Green Lotus Pill for you.”</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Ye Xiuwen picked up his teacup and took a sip from it, not knowing what else he could add.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Old Man Chi rubbed his temples – <em>I guess I’m getting on in my years now. I can no longer tell what young people are thinking these days. Just some time ago, they were each still fraught with immense envy and jealousy, yet overnight, they appear to be completely harmonious. If I didn’t know better, I might even mistake them for mere siblings right now.</em></p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Jun Xiaomo smiled back at Rong Ruihan in gratitude. Suddenly, an ephemeral notion flickered past the depths of her mind in an instant so quickly that she failed to latch onto it.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Lowering her head, Jun Xiaomo mulled over it for a little bit more, before looking back up and declaring, “I think I know where the Green Lotus Pill might be. I’ve briefly heard of it before.”</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“What?!” Jun Xiaomo’s words were like a stone that shattered the tranquil atmosphere in the room. Even the sprightly old man widened his eyes in disbelief as he barked, “Where did ye hear of this?!”</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">It wasn’t hard to see why the sprightly old man found Jun Xiaomo’s words so hard to believe. Back then, his wife had passed on precisely because they were unable to locate the Green Lotus Pill and the Rainbow Flower Lotus. Even though his wife had already passed on years ago, he had to date been unable to learn much of the Green Lotus Pill. In fact, the whereabouts of the Green Lotus Pill had even become somewhat of an obsession to him after all these years.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">How could he have imagined that a young sprout that Jun Xiaomo was could actually know of the Ninth-Grade Green Lotus Pill’s whereabouts?! As much as the sprightly old man was astonished, he was similarly rather disappointed.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">If it had truly been that easy to find, why wasn’t he able to locate it after all these years? Could the problem be with his own capabilities?</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">As he thought about these things, the sprightly old man couldn’t help but feel an urge to flip the table in the room.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Naturally, Jun Xiaomo’s following words were even more astonishing, “Even though I know where it is, we won’t be able to obtain it just yet.”</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Jun Xiaomo spoke with earnest.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“Why?” Old Man Chi furrowed his brows, “Could it be in the hands of a Hidden Sect?”</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">If that were the case, it would be absolutely reasonable if they were unable to obtain it just yet. After all, even a powerful clan like the Chi Clan would hardly deign to provoke an equally powerful Hidden Sect in the spiritual cultivation world. The potential losses in such a tussle could be dire.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Jun Xiaomo paused for a moment, before shaking her head, “It’s not that it’s in the possession of a powerful entity, but…”</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Jun Xiaomo paused.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“But what?” Everyone looked at Jun Xiaomo with bewilderment.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Jun Xiaomo looked straight back at them with some reservations in her heart.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Ye Xiuwen stretched out his arm and held Jun Xiaomo’s right hand gingerly, “Don’t worry. If you don’t want to talk about it right now, we could always discuss this another time.”</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">The hesitation in Jun Xiaomo’s heart began to wash away as she reveled in the firm sense of security washing through her heart from Ye Xiuwen’s touch.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Finally, she mustered her courage and continued, “The Green Lotus Pill hasn’t appeared yet, but I know of its whereabouts. Furthermore, it won’t be too long before the powerhouses in the world will make a beeline towards its whereabouts.”</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“What does that mean?” Old Man Chi was getting somewhat annoyed by Jun Xiaomo’s enigmatic explanations.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“It’s an Arcane Realm. In three months, a new Arcane Realm will surface in the world in the south-western direction. The powerhouses of this world would undoubtedly be striving to obtain the ownership rights of the Arcane Realm. If memory serves me well, there are several pills and medicines in this Arcane Realm, one of which is a Ninth-Grade Green Lotus Pill.” Jun Xiaomo explained one word at a time.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“Haa--?! What kind of a joke is this? Miss Jun, how could you possibly know of an Arcane Realm’s location before it even appears? Do you have the powers of clairvoyance now?” Old Man Chi shrugged off Jun Xiaomo’s explanations with displeasure. He disliked boastful people the most. To his mind, Jun Xiaomo’s words were as incredible as if the sun were to rise from the west.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Jun Xiaomo shook her head as she maintained, “I know that Old Man Chi finds this difficult to believe. However, this is the truth.”</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Because, she had experienced the very same contention for ownership to the Arcane Realm in her previous life. At that time, Yu Wanrou had managed to seize ownership of the Arcane Realm with the aid of her following of men.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">If not for her possession of the Arcane Realm acting as a springboard for her ambitions, Yu Wanrou would never have been able to obtain the favor of such a large following of men later in her life. In fact, it would not be too farfetched to say that the possession of an Arcane Realm was akin to becoming the Sect Leader of a large, powerful sect.
