 <p style="text-align: justify">On Jun Xiaomo’s suggestion, Ye Xiuwen lifted her up, activated his Windwalk abilities and immediately sprinted towards the woods outside the Dawn Sect’s grounds.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">The Dawn Sect’s leaders were unaware that something was up. After all, given how they had the advantage both in terms of numbers as well as their overall cultivation level, they unanimously thought that Ye Xiuwen’s intention was to retreat and escape. Thus, all of them immediately gave chase.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Ye Xiuwen could sense Jun Xiaomo’s grip weakening, and he immediately noticed that she was beginning to slump, almost as though she were getting completely drained of energy.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“Xiaomo?” Ye Xiuwen furrowed his brows as he called out to her gently.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“Martial brother Ye…” Jun Xiaomo smiled bitterly, “I’m getting a bit lightheaded. I don’t think I can hang in there anymore. I’m going to sleep for a bit first. Wake me up when we’re at the woods.”</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">When Jun Xiaomo was still fighting alone, she would with sheer willpower grit her teeth and fight through the pain, no matter how harsh her environment and how grievous her wounds. But now that she was in the arms of someone whom she wholeheartedly trusted, her spirits subconsciously loosened up, and her grit soon gave way.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Just like that, Jun Xiaomo fell into a deep slumber…</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“Damn!” Ye Xiuwen cursed aloud as he hurriedly retrieved a bottle of recovery pills from his Interspatial Ring and forced Jun Xiaomo to ingest the pills.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify"><em>How could I have forgotten something so important?</em> Ye Xiuwen couldn’t help but berate himself.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“Xiaomo, don’t sleep yet. Let’s wait till we get to a safe place before you sleep, alright?” Ye Xiuwen patted Jun Xiaomo’s cheeks lightly.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">However, Jun Xiaomo appeared to have completely passed out, and she did not give any form of response whatsoever.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">A trace of heaviness flickered across the depths of Ye Xiuwen’s eyes. His little martial sister was among the youngest of all of them, yet she still had to carry such heavy burdens all on her own.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Then, an unwavering determination washed over his heart – <em>No matter what happens, I’m going to bring Jun Xiaomo out of this place alive!</em></p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">As they drew closer to the forest outside the Dawn Sect’s grounds, Ye Xiuwen resolved in his heart not to awaken Jun Xiaomo if she remained unconscious, because he did not want her to bear with such a heavy burden on her own any longer. Furthermore, he knew that if Jun Xiaomo overdrew the energy within her body in such a condition, the consequences would truly be dire! If he could, he would most certainly hope to leave with Jun Xiaomo just like that.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Fortunately, Jun Xiaomo regained consciousness on her own accord as soon as they arrived at the forest.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“Martial brother, bring me to the place where the spiritual energy is the thickest. That is where the heart of the formation array is located.” Jun Xiaomo spoke softly.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Ye Xiuwen furrowed his brows as he responded, “Rest for a little bit more. I’ll bring you to a safe place right now.”</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">As soon as they were out of the forest, they would be able to leave using a Teleportation Scroll. At that time, even the old fogeys from the Dawn Sect would not be able to track down exactly where they had gone.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“No, don’t! Martial brother, this is a prime opportunity. I don’t want to give those bastards another opportunity to recover.” Jun Xiaomo spoke with a resolute, unflappable determination. It was as though she were drawing on a mysterious source of energy as she lifted her head once more and stared straight into Ye Xiuwen’s eyes. It was a look filled with pleading and hope.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Faced with such a gaze from his little martial sister, Ye Xiuwen found himself unable to reject her earnest pleading.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“Alright, but you can’t force the issue, and you must never overdraft your energy, understand?” Ye Xiuwen cautioned in all seriousness.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">He had no choice. He knew that he could only relent when Jun Xiaomo pleaded with him like that. He could sense the deep, immense hatred against the Dawn Sect’s old fogeys that was buried in the depths of Jun Xiaomo’s heart. If she were not given the opportunity to deal a heavy blow to those old fogeys right now, he knew full well that Jun Xiaomo would be downcast for a very long time.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Just like that, Ye Xiuwen brought Jun Xiaomo over to the part of the forest where the spiritual energy was the thickest, and slowly set her down there.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“Martial brother, there’s something else that I would like your help with.” Jun Xiaomo hesitated before asking.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Ye Xiuwen noticed the hesitance in Jun Xiaomo’s eyes, and he patted her head as he cajoled, “Speak your mind. What’s there that you’re unable to tell your martial brother about?”</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“The Grand Elder possesses a piece of Chimeric Jade on him. As long as that piece of Chimeric Jade is on him, he will be practically impervious to the effects of the formation array, so…”</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“Are you asking your martial brother can help you to break the piece of Chimeric Jade, or are you asking your martial brother to deal with the Grand Elder and keep him busy?” Ye Xiuwen gave Jun Xiaomo an indulgent look.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“Actually, both are fine. I’ll be trapping the others using the formation array, isolating the Grand Elder. That way, it will be convenient for you to go about doing what you need to do. That said, the Grand Elder is far too powerful, and I’m quite afraid that this arrangement will endanger martial brother.” Jun Xiaomo explained the concerns on her heart.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Truth be told, there was truly no rush to deal with the old fogeys from the Dawn Sect. However, this was undoubtedly a prime opportunity that had presented itself. If they missed out on such an opportunity like this, the old fogeys from the Dawn Sect would have all the time they need to rest and recuperate. By then, it would be much more difficult if Jun Xiaomo wished to deal with them again.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">This was why Jun Xiaomo was so determined to deal a heavy blow to the old fogeys right now.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“Alright. Then, leave the Grand Elder to your martial brother. You have to be careful.” Ye Xiuwen instructed.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Jun Xiaomo deliberated for a little while more, and then she suddenly grabbed onto Ye Xiuwen’s hand and quipped, “Martial brother, scratch that. It would be best if you don’t go instead. It’ll suffice if I trap the others within the Sect’s protective formation array. We can leave the Grand Elder be and deal with him another time.”</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Jun Xiaomo gazed earnestly into Ye Xiuwen’s eyes with a grimace on her face as she tugged at his hands. It was as though she were concerned that he would engage in a life-or-death battle with the Grand Elder in the very next moment.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Ye Xiuwen sighed and pulling his hand out. Then, he lightly hugged her and patted her back.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“Don’t worry, your martial brother still has a high-grade Invisibility Talisman which you had given earlier. Little Mo, I’m your older martial brother. You don’t have to bear all of the burden yourself; let your martial brother help you with some of that, alright? Believe me, nothing will go wrong.”</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Jun Xiaomo’s heart soured. The rims of her eyes turned red and she fought back her tears as she responded, “Alright. Martial brother is not allowed to lie to me. Come back if you’re unable to deal with the Grand Elder. You’re not allowed to disappear again just like that.”</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Ye Xiuwen smiled, “Alright.”</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">As he finished speaking, he paused for a moment, and then bent down and gave Jun Xiaomo a gentle peck on the top of her head.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Jun Xiaomo’s heart trembled slightly. Then, before she could react, Ye Xiuwen spun around and sped off into the distance. Jun Xiaomo immediately lifted her hand and grabbed at the air, but all she saw was a green-garbed figure speeding into the distance.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Ye Xiuwen possessed a wind-based spiritual root, and his movements were simply too quick – Jun Xiaomo was unable to catch a hold of him.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“Martial brother Ye, you’ve got to come back.” Jun Xiaomo muttered softly as a trace of resolute determination filled her eyes.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">On the other side, the Dawn Sect’s old fogeys followed Ye Xiuwen and Jun Xiaomo into the forest just outside the Dawn Sect’s grounds before losing sight of the two.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“Damn! It’s just been slightly over ten years. How in the world did Ye Xiuwen become so formidable in such a short span of time?!” The Fifth Elder decried with indignation.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Even though Ye Xiuwen’s talent for cultivation had always been relatively high, they knew that it was not very much different from Qin Lingyu’s standards. That said, it was evident that there was a massive rift between Ye Xiuwen and Qin Lingyu’s abilities right now.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">This was something that had been bugging everyone around, especially Qin Lingyu. Qin Lingyu had previously seen Ye Xiuwen as his greatest rival because Ye Xiuwen was the only one whose talent for cultivation was comparable with his own.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">But as things were right now, Ye Xiuwen had already left him in the dust. Was there still any hope of catching up to Ye Xiuwen’s abilities?</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">These thoughts left a sour taste in Qin Lingyu’s mouth and a stifling feeling in his heart. Qin Lingyu couldn’t help but curse Ye Xiuwen in his heart, hoping that Ye Xiuwen would wake up one day only to find that his cultivation level had been entirely crippled. That way, Qin Lingyu would finally be able to trample on Ye Xiuwen underfoot.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">As they continued to walk on, Qin Lingyu suddenly discovered that the scenery around had changed, and the Sect Elders and Peakmasters around him had also suddenly vanished.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify"><em>Damn! This must be the Sect’s protective formation array!</em></p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Qin Lingyu’s mind immediately blared with warning signs, and he began to berate himself for being too complacent and careless earlier.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">He should have known this. Since Jun Ziwen was none other than Ye Xiuwen, then the Sect’s protective formation array could not have been altered or tampered with by him, and it was far more likely that the culprit for that initial incident was Jun Xiaomo.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Unfortunately, he had been overwhelmed by the rage plaguing his mind, and such a realization had come far too late.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Now that he thought about things more clearly, it was evident that Jun Xiaomo and Ye Xiuwen had rushed straight towards the forest surrounding the Dawn Sect’s grounds precisely because they had a clear plan in mind. They had always intended to trap the Sect Elders and the Peakmasters within the Sect’s protective formation array and deal with them using the formation array’s abilities.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify"><em>What should I do now? How do I get out of here? What’s Jun Xiaomo thinking of doing to us here? Is she going to kill us?</em></p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Qin Lingyu couldn’t help but recall how horrific the sight of He Zhang’s endless torment was, and he shuddered as chills went down his back.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify"><em>What do I do? I don’t want to die! I’ve got to get out of here!</em></p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">The present Qin Lingyu no longer thought about his nuanced schemes and ploys any longer. As the Sword of Damocles dangled dangerously over his head, this was the first time he had realized just how fearsome a powerful array master was. To think that a formidable cultivator in the Golden Core stage of cultivation like him would find himself in such a powerless situation!</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">As worry and anxiety mounted in his heart, a tendril covered in spikes suddenly shot out from the ground and bound up his entire body and limbs. At the very next moment, another tendril instantly swept towards Qin Lingyu and lashed him across the face.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">“Ahh--!!” Qin Lingyu cried out in pain, and a gash so deep that his bones could be seen instantly splayed across his face from his left forehead all the way to the right side of his lower jaw.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">To make matters worse, he instantly began to feel a painful and itchy sensation spreading across his entire face. He felt so much like scratching his macabre wound to relieve himself of the unbearable itch, yet his limbs were entirely bound and restrained by the first tendril.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">Just like that, Qin Lingyu’s handsome and suave appearances were completely ruined, and he also fainted from the overwhelming pain that spread throughout his body.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">As the tendril continued to bind and restrained the unconscious Qin Lingyu, the little spikes on the tendril that had already penetrated his skin began to divert threads of spiritual energy from his meridians and absorb them into the tendrils.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">On the other side, at the heart of the formation array, Jun Xiaomo sat cross-legged on the ground, and a holographic display of the protective formation array’s domain was floating in front of her eyes. As she silently observed Qin Lingyu’s present appearances, a cold, frosty smile crept up the corner of her lips.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">A similar sight was playing out at different parts of the protective formation array’s domain. Apart from the Grand Elder who possessed the Chimeric Jade, all of the other old fogeys from Dawn Sect had met with the same fate of being attacked by the mysterious tendrils that had sprouted out of nowhere.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify">These tendrils were not in fact real spirit plants that existed in the cultivation world. Rather, they were simply a material manifestation of the illusion-inducing formation array’s effects. Through these tendrils, the illusion-inducing formation array would absorb the spiritual energy from their prey in order to continually sustain its own formation array. This was an ability that the illusion-inducing formation array had gained after Jun Xiaomo’s modifications to it.</p>
