<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p style="text-align: justify;">Qin Lingyu and Jun Xiaomo hastily picked up their swords to defend themselves. But as Ye Xiuwen’s hatred festered, his combat abilities only grew stronger and more aggressive. In contrast, Qin Lingyu and Jun Xiaomo had lost any modicum of advantage that they earlier had over Ye Xiuwen, and their attacks only grew weaker and feebler as time went by.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">In just a few moments, Ye Xiuwen’s heart cut a deep gash across Qin Lingyu’s throat, and scarlet blood spurted and gurgled out from Qin Lingyu’s throat, spattering across the floor of the courtyard.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">Qin Lingyu’s eyes widened in shock, as though he had never expected to die in such a clean and concise manner.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">At the same time, outside of Ye Xiuwen’s illusion, a fairly large red flower slowly withered up. Another similarly large flower stood just beside that withered red flower, and this flower looked almost listless right now.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">“Martial brother Ye! I’m your younger martial sister! Do you want to kill me as well?!” Jun Xiaomo’s body was now covered with numerous wounds and injuries. Her odds of survival had greatly diminished now that she had lost her companion.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">Jun Xiaomo panicked. She clutched at straws and resorted to reminding Ye Xiuwen of her identity.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">Yet, she succeeded by a lucky stroke of fate. Having heard her desperate yell, Ye Xiuwen paused in his steps.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Little martial sister? That’s right, she’s the daughter of my master after all…</em></p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">Ye Xiuwen deeply respected Jun Linxuan and Liu Qingmei. Naturally, he would never do anything to hurt these people whom he owed such a great debt of gratitude to.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">Thus, Ye Xiuwen sheathed his sword. Even though his eyes were still covered with a thick layer of frost, he had already cast off his earlier intent to kill Jun Xiaomo.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Forget it. She’s not the culprit who caused Little Mo’s death anyway.</em> Ye Xiuwen turned to leave. He was on his path of vengeance against all who had caused Yao Mo’s death – especially the Inferno Kingdom’s Grand Vizier!</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">Just as Ye Xiuwen showed his back, Jun Xiaomo’s eyes flickered with a vicious intent. She braced herself as she prepared to change the contents of the illusion to another scene in a bid to reignite the despair and despondence in Ye Xiuwen’s heart.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">However, this little red flower never found a chance to execute its schemes. Just as it was planning its next move, the real Jun Xiaomo managed to locate its physical body, and a stalk of particularly large, red flower was uprooted just like that.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">Jun Xiaomo took a gander at the particularly large red flower and the Blisterfruits hanging below as she nodded her head and exclaimed with great satisfaction, “With this bunch of Blisterfruit, there should now be sufficient medicinal element for martial brother Ye’s cure. Furthermore, the grade of this Blisterfruit seems better than the others. There should be a higher chance of success in its refinement too!”</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">There were varying grades of Blisterfruits, even among those she had just harvested. For example, the last bunch of Blisterfruit that she had harvested was part of a little red flower that had already developed a basic spiritual awareness. Naturally, it was of a higher grade than the rest, and the medicine refined from it would be more effective. It was also more valuable.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">That’s right, the Blisterfruits could also be sold for money, and its price was rather considerable as well. After all, few people could overcome the illusions created by these little red flowers. Therefore, despite the thriving market for these fruits, there were not many people were able to harvest and sell these Blisterfruits.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">Jun Xiaomo stored the last bunch of Blisterfruits that she had just harvested into her Interspatial Ring. Then, she began digging for more Blisterfruits.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">“Come to think of it, I wonder where brother Ye, the first prince and my little packrat are?” Jun Xiaomo furrowed her brows as she wracked her mind.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">--------------------------------------------</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">“Ahhh--!” In his illusion, Ye Xiuwen only heard a shrill, pained shriek call out from behind him. As he reflexively turned his head, he witnessed Jun Xiaomo disintegrating into fine powder before dispersing and scattering into the air.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">“Xiaomo?” It was his martial sister after all. Ye Xiuwen could hardly bring himself to watch on as she died. Therefore, he ran back into her courtyard anxiously. However, it was all too late. There was no longer any trace of his little martial sister left.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">Not only had Jun Xiaomo vanished, even Qin Lingyu’s corpse had completely disappeared.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">“What’s going on here?!” Ye Xiuwen furrowed his eyebrows. His first thoughts were – <em>Could this all be caused by the Grand Vizier?</em></p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">However, he was very soon presented with the answer. His surroundings began to shift, and a thick fog once again settled over the courtyard, obscuring his entire view. It was just like how he first entered this place to begin with.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">It was at this moment that Ye Xiuwen’s mind suddenly blared out its realization – <em>Illusion!</em></p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">Ye Xiuwen had read about illusions from books and literature, but he had never personally experienced one before.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">It could only be said that theoretical knowledge and physical experiences were incredibly different. It was only after one had experience such things could one properly be guarded and vigilant against these things.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">Just in that moment when Ye Xiuwen noticed that he had fallen into an illusion, the surrounding white mist began to vanish and dissipate…</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">“Brother Ye?!” A familiar voice called out not too far away. This voice carried with it traces of joy that accompanied a blissful reunion.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Little Mo…</em></p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">Ye Xiuwen practically immediately recognized the owner of this voice. His heart skipped a beat, and he leapt to his feet –</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>As expected! Little Mo isn’t dead!</em></p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">This was also the first time that Ye Xiuwen developed some measure of gratitude in his heart for the earlier illusion that he had experienced. At the very least, he was thankful that they were no more than an illusion – none of it was real.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">“Brother Ye…?” As the voice drew nearer, it seemed to carry with it a trace of hesitation.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">Yet this measure of hesitation was completely understandable. After experiencing that incredibly vivid illusory world, she could not be sure that what she was seeing right now was reality and not another illusion.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">Besides, she had not noticed Ye Xiuwen lying here earlier. Why would he suddenly appear out of nowhere?</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">What Jun Xiaomo did not know was that whenever a person was trapped in an illusion created by these little red flowers, others would not be able to see that person. It was only when a person had thoroughly broken free of the shackles of these illusions that he would once again be visible to the others. The principles behind this was akin to that of formation arrays.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">Therefore, once Ye Xiuwen broke free of the control of his illusory world, he instantly appeared where he had always been laying – behind Jun Xiaomo’s back.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">Ye Xiuwen stood with an erect back. He had shut his eyes tightly earlier, and he only just slowly began to open his eyes once again.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">A bright ray of light shone into his pupils. Then, a small figure entered his field of vision.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">Ye Xiuwen immediately recognized the characteristic green garbs on that person –</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">“Little Mo!” Ye Xiuwen strode forward quickly and pulled Jun Xiaomo into a hearty embrace!</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">“Bro…brother Ye?” Jun Xiaomo’s ears instantly turned red.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">That cool and aloof disposition about Ye Xiuwen made her realize that this was undoubtedly her martial brother.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>But…but isn’t martial brother being a little bit too passionate right now? It’s not like I haven’t seen him in a few hundred years…</em></p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">The burning sensation from Jun Xiaomo’s ears began to spread to her face, and then her neck. She could feel that her heart was now beginning to beat faster and faster, but she could not understand why.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">After some hesitation, Jun Xiaomo slowly lifted her hands and softly hugged Ye Xiuwen as well. She patted his back, as though assuring him that everything was fine now.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">“I’m…I’m fine…” Jun Xiaomo stammered.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">She knew that Ye Xiuwen was worried that something might have happened to her. That was the only plausible explanation for Ye Xiuwen’s current outburst of emotions.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">Ye Xiuwen’s eyes were slightly bloodshot. He continued to hold Jun Xiaomo in a tight embrace. Then, he mustered all his strength and courage before he finally managed to collect his emotions and suppress his dread, lingering fear, anxiety, and other similar feelings.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">“Mm, we’re both fine now.” Ye Xiuwen tousled the young man’s hair. After some time, he finally loosened his grip and let go of Jun Xiaomo.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">By now, Jun Xiaomo’s cheeks had already turned incredibly warm. They were flushed with a radiant, pink hue.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">Jun Xiaomo lowered her head bashfully, so that Ye Xiuwen could not see the expressions on her face. But Ye Xiuwen could nevertheless see Yao Mo’s reddened neck and ears. He knew that Yao Mo was…shy.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">Ye Xiuwen’s heart quivered. He put a finger to the young man’s chin and lifted his face gently.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">Jun Xiaomo had never expected her martial brother to act so coquettishly towards her. Therefore, she stared back at him in shock.</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">Yet when he saw “Yao Mo’s” appearance, Ye Xiuwen became even more dumbfounded than Jun Xiaomo was –</p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">The person standing in front of her was not some “young man” at all. That green-garbed person was undeniably his little martial sister!</p>
