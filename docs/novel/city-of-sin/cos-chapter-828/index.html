 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Richard quickly realised that the possibility of an open murder had been precluded by the secret assassination attempt and the poisoning. They couldn’t afford to face him directly about these things.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps he could blow up the issue,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">he thought, but this idea was immediately rejected. He was in the enemies’ backyard, and forcing a confrontation would only guarantee his death. He started cursing himself fervently; in all his calculations, he hadn’t expected the barbarians to stoop so low!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He took a deep breath and forced himself to calm down. His first thought was to escape anyway— if the elders killed him here, then he wouldn’t even be able to avenge Mountainsea’s fate. However, just as he turned around he saw two shrine warriors step forward, “Richard, your battle is first. Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He looked back and glared at the older warriors, “The elders really arranged this well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These words caused the barbarians to look away in shame.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The road from the camps to the shrine building wasn’t particularly long, but the ten minutes provided Richard his last opportunity to make a decision. He examined his condition as they walked along, finding that he had already dropped to level 17 and was falling further. Fortunately Manacycle hadn’t been stripped away in the process, but his bloodlines were shrinking in from the erosion of the poison. Even the astral world tree and the well of stars were growing sluggish, with the elemental world tree even starting to shed and degrade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only the Archeron blood retained its violent nature, clashing with the poison and refusing to give way. He tried to mobilise his powers from there, and despite the damage the power of his truename still erupted within. This meant he could use his abyssal flames and the powers associated with them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He already understood that the elders hoped he would die in a “fair” battle. This would partially placate Sharon and the Sacred Alliance, while Mountainsea and the barbarians wouldn’t complain either. However, he just sneered at the thought; they would get an intense battle, whether they wanted it or not!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Along the way, he saw the heads of nearly a hundred barbarian tribes sitting on one side of the field, alongside the elders of the Council. Urazadzu was also amongst them, someone he had greatly admired during their few meetings when he was a child. Now, he knew that the Great Shaman of the Azuresnow Shrine was worthy of no more respect than dirt. Forget just knowing about it, the old man was likely one of the masters behind the scenes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, as hard as he looked, he couldn’t find Mountainsea anywhere. She was likely being kept away because she would realise that something was wrong. Eventually he just shook his head, climbing up on stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Heavy footsteps rang through the arena as a buff warrior with short, spiky hair headed up from the other side, raising the heavy hammer in his hand, “My name is Pangun, but most people in the Shrine call me Bloodhammer. I like that name.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Richard looked at Bloodhammer’s eyes and could immediately tell the killing intent within. Surely enough, the Council had planned to kill him off in the very first battle. He silently pulled Carnage out of his sword case.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Aren’t you a mage?” Bloodhammer snorted, “Don’t you lot use staffs?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Richard didn’t answer, not even looking at the barbarian as his gaze focused on Carnage and poured his bloodthirst within. The blade immediately felt its owner’s intent, starting to buzz gently with a sound only he could hear. It was like a thousand soldiers were ready to fight at his beck and call!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was some doubt in Bloodhammer’s eyes, but he was an experienced warrior himself. He started walking over, every single step booming like a war drum.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>

One of the warriors of the Shrine who was rushing across the corridor waved to him, “I heard the battle has begun. Damn it, I’ll be late again! Grand Elder, are you not going to watch the battle? Some of the warriors this year are very powerful.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No, I have something to do,” the old man said with a smile, sending the warrior on his way. He then returned to his office and sat down, feeling an inexplicable fatigue. He had entered the legendary realm a hundred years ago, and this was the most tired he had ever felt since then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as the Grand Elder sighed, one of his confidants knocked on the door and came in, “Grand Elder, the battle between Richard and Bloodhammer has begun.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Has everything been arranged?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have already confirmed that Richard ate his breakfast this morning. In fact, even without these means he would not have been Bloodhammer’s opponent. Pangun’s ability is powerful and his totems are not weak. With his wealth of exp—”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are correct, but we do need to be safe with these things. Make sure to remain discreet, we do not know what will happen if Mountainsea finds out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes!” the elder said humbly, before handing over a letter, “This came from the Sacred Alliance, and it was addressed to you. They also sent a message that messengers will arrive at the Shrine within a week.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Sacred Alliance? What do they want, we haven’t made contact in years…” The elder frowned, a bad premonition overcoming his heart as he tore the letter open and started to read it carefully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The battle between Bloodhammer and Richard should have ended. You should come see the ceremony, you rarely reveal yourself in recent years…” the younger elder commented.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These words immediately caused the Grand Elder’s face to warp, “Wait, what did you say?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmm? Oh, the battle should be finished by now…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s done?!”</span></p>

How could Richard last so long after the poisoning?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Grand Elder threw the letter in his hands and flashed out of the room, disappearing down the corridor. The other elder was shocked by a change, unable to understand just what had happened, but seeing the letter fall to the ground he picked it up for a quick glance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The content was quite simple:</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I heard that Richard has come to Klandor. The kid is very important to the Sacred Alliance, so keep that in mind. I hope you will entertain him this time, but I cannot control just how. I only have two requirements; he needs to come back alive, and his abilities with magic and runecrafting cannot be damaged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If that happens, then I will owe you a favour. If that does not… Don’t blame me for what happens next. I’ve never really cared about the big picture, only that the kid is worth multiple fortresses to me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The letter had been sent by Emperor Philip. Most of the words had been scribbled, but each stroke was ripe with the power of laws. As a legendary being himself, the elder could quickly surmise that Philip was almost completely healed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The elder took another look through, but the power of laws gushing out of the words left him pale. He forced himself to calm down, but his hands started to tremble at the mountainous weight of the words that had been conveyed. Although Klandor didn’t normally participate in planar wars, the battlefields of despair were an exception.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Emperor Philip had already taken a Daxdian fortress almost single-handedly, their own would be like paper before his might!</span></p>
