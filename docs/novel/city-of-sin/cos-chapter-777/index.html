 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For some reason, Duke Peron’s third daughter was dressed like any other minor noble, the attire so poor for someone of her status that it almost looked humiliating. She had been inconspicuous among the group of young ladies, almost unnoticeable if not for speaking out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wendy was the kind of partner Jaaron always sought but could never hope to attain. The Peron Family was far more powerful than the Mensas, while Jaaron wasn’t even a direct descendant and was more than a decade older than her. Even meeting Wendy was difficult for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing her amongst this group, Jaaron’s voice immediately turned gentle, “Miss Wendy, what are you doing here? I don’t see any competent guards nearby, what if you met with danger? These rascals aren’t fit for someone of your status, why don’t I escort you back to Faust?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The noble youths were riled up by Jaaron’s comments, but they couldn’t do anything about it either. They hadn’t even realised her identity themselves; she had been brought in as a friend by two girls from a vassal family and had remained silent with a big cloak and high collar covering most of her face. They would never have dreamed that they were out with the third daughter of the prestigious Duke Peron.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, they quickly recalled that Wendy was so pampered she had the right to choose her own partner. Being fancied by a lady of such great status would result in a meteoric rise for their entire families! In the face of such temptation, Jaaron didn’t seem scary at all.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How could they let go of such an opportunity?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jaaron himself listened as the nobles’ words grew increasingly nasty, his fury quickly getting the better of him as he yelled, “Get the hell out of here or I’m breaking your legs!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The youths instantly shuddered, but even as they went mute another voice suddenly rang out, “What’s going on here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unexpectedly enough, the patrol team had arrived even before the royal knights, led by a young man in simple mage robes that seemed to have no enchantments at all. He was the one who’d posed the question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jaaron felt his eye twitch at the sight of the Archeron crest on the knights’ armour, and he grunted at the thought of his misfortune. It was their turn to patrol today, and under Richard’s lead they were no longer as fragile a family as they once were. All thirty knights were well-equipped, and the leader was even a mage who looked to be level 16 or 17!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">‘Just how much money do those bastards have?’ Jaaron complained in his mind before saying coldly, “These are matters of the Mensa Family, why are the Archerons interfering?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young mage smiled, “Interfere? I’m just performing my duty. If you have any problems, you’re welcome to bring up the matter at the assembly. For now, you are to obey my words.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How dare you! I am Jaaron Mensa, you have no right to—”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re who?” the young mage interrupted, “Whatever, get down here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For a moment, Jaaron lost his proud expression. The sheer insult almost caused his flight spell to falter. “You bastard, I’ll have you pay for this with your life!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmm? You want a duel, I take it? Gladly, go tell your old coot that you accepted a duel with Richard Archeron.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, Jaaron had been whipped up into a frenzy, prepared to mock the enemy without second though, “Who’s ever heard of Rich—”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Richard!” the female saint nearby interrupted, snapping him out of his hysteria and letting him recall just who it was that he was taking on. His expression immediately warped as warning sirens screamed in his mind;&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">the family head of the Archerons was actually leading a patrol team, what kind of plot was this?</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;It was only after looking through the knights behind that Jaaron’s heart calmed a little. These patrol knights seemed to be around level 14 or 15, which wasn’t too much of a threat even with thirty of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Richard paid no attention to Jaaron as he pointed towards the boy who was currently struggling on the ground, “Who did this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A few of the aggrieved nobles immediately pointed to the Mensa elite knight, ““It’s him!””</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Richard turned to the aforementioned knight, “You, dismount and put your weapons away. You’re coming with us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What did you say?!” the knight almost roared, tightening his grip on his sword as he glowered at Richard. It would take a miracle to make him comply.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A commoner dared to injure a noble? And now you’re even speaking to me in such a tone. Disarm yourself and crawl over here, don’t make my knights do it for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Crawl?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">None of the Mensa knights could believe their ears, their eyes burning with rage. Most of them were indeed commoners, but they were still knights of the powerful Mensa Family!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were even part of the planar war efforts!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was an unwritten rule that even a regular soldier of a powerful family was superior to a minor noble. Richard’s declaration of crime was technically true, but in most cases the knight would only be reprimanded for a moment and have to compensate for the youth’s medical bills. Nobody wanted to blow up such a small conflict unless they wished to offend the Mensa Family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, everyone understood that Richard was here to do just that. Jaaron turned grim, but before he could even speak up one of Richard’s knights had already kicked the resisting man off his horse. The Mensa knight was then dragged towards Richard, and in the few metres of distance that needed to be covered all of his armour had been stripped off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The knight moved like lightning, completing his task before the Mensas could even react. The captain didn’t even have the strength to struggle in the knight’s hand, clearly knocked half-unconscious. Just as quickly as he had charged out, the patrol knight returned to join the rest of his team.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The saint had originally planned to intercept the incoming knight, but the moment she saw the speed of the charge she had pulled back. “Rune knight!” she whispered quietly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Richard immediately turned towards her, scanning her from head to toe, “Ah, Miss Yuria, is it? You have a pretty good eye.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yuria was glaring at Richard as her face went red, but she forced herself to avoid a confrontation here. She was considered an expert who hailed from the battlefields of despair herself, making her a core member of the Mensa Family, but she wasn’t foolish enough to attack someone with Richard’s status. This was especially so when she recognised that one of the thirty ordinary-looking knights was a rune knight.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What, then, were the others?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Richard obviously didn’t have any plans to let it all end there. He looked towards all of the Mensa knights who had subconsciously drawn their weapons, saying indifferently, “You lot dare to draw your weapons in my presence? Dismount from your horses and follow me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lord Richard, you’re going too far!” Jaaron finally interjected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Richard barely even spared him a glance, “And who are you to say that? There’s no place for you here.”</span></p>
