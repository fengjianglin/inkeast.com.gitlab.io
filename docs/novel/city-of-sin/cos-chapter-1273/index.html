 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline">Giving In</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Agamemnon would normally have been stirred to action by insults that he was an asskisser, but this time he restrained himself. The Ironblood Duke had heard everything, but he merely frowned without saying a word in response to the indignation to his heir. He was evidently conflicted about the death of Sispek, to the point of ignoring the flagrant taunts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beye was the one to speak up, “Those legends under Richard aren’t much, just a small advantage in numbers. That being said, anyone who wants to fight a war with the Archerons can go ahead. I’m not sticking my nose into that.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Outside of Agamemnon, everyone in the room grew alarmed. Even though Beye was the youngest legend of the Orleans Family, her power had skyrocketed the moment she entered the legendary realm. She was already level 23 and had awoken a number of strong abilities, starting to rival even the Ironblood Duke in combat ability.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Beye, why would you do this?” The youth had been confident precisely because the family had two legends that were close to the epic realm, but if Beye was unwilling to assist this was meaningless. However, he also didn’t have the guts to taunt her like he did Agamemnon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Because Richard wasn’t wrong. There’s no reason for the Ironbloods to avenge a worthless man like Sispek.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">”Sispek is your uncle!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yours too. If you want to go into battle, go fight one of the Archeron legends to avenge him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The… How am I supposed to face a legend…” The young man was only an ordinary saint. Basically every legendary being could kill him in one blow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then get the fuck out of my sight,” she seemed to lose her patience.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The youth was shocked, angry, and embarrassed. He cast an accusatory glance at the Duke, but that was all he could do. Beye was known to be the second coming of Empress Apeiron, with an appetite for killing and a complete lack of fear. If he really did provoke her, she wouldn’t hesitate to kill him instantly even in front of the Ironblood Duke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, he knew she would relish it. Just like many other higher families, the Orleans Family had no qualms with inbreeding. He had lusted after her strong nightmare shade bloodline before, but his incessant advances had drawn ire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Enough!” the Duke suddenly interrupted, his chest heaving as he looked at Agamemnon, “You’re my successor, explain your stance.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The fault lies with Sispek, not Richard,” Agamemnon said directly, “There is no point in fighting a battle we cannot win, especially when we are in the wrong. How many legends do you think would tie themselves to a sinking ship just for money? Don’t forget the reward point system.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These words from the reticent youth shocked everyone, including the Duke himself. The clouds in his mind seemed to clear; indeed, there was no one who could become a legend with a weak personality. Some of them could be tempted by money, but four legends wouldn’t serve Richard just because of that. He clearly had the capability to offer them more than just that, and they had to be convinced by his personal ability as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Duke still remained a little resentful and looked back at Beye. However, she just walked up and stared at him with her near-white eyes, “He’s right. Even if I go all out, there’s no way for us to win.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What? How?” Even the Duke was shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Because it’s Richard. If he’s decided to do something, then he has to be confident. Why would he reveal news of Sharon’s disappearance so directly, why would he break all traditions and kill nobles without trial? He’s motivated to avenge Sharon, but he isn’t the type to just go mad and do so without a plan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But then he’d be challenging the entire Sacred Alliance.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So he’s confident in taking us all out. Yes, he’s young, but you’ve seen his rise yourself. We might have millennia of history, and he might only have come to power for a few decades if we include Gaton, but longevity doesn’t directly correspond to power. His enemy is sitting in the palace, it’s not us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Duke sighed, falling back into his seat, “You’re right, I’m getting old…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beye smiled faintly. When she had first become legendary, there were multiple occasions where others had been offended by her arrogance. Those centuries older than her had been unwilling to give her the respect she deserved, but that had been fixed by violence. Eventually, serious injuries to two of them had shut the rest up. In much the same way, Richard was using the Orleans Family as a stepping stone to power. He might or might not have been willing to do it, but that was how the dice fell. Sispek had forced his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Resolution washed over the Ironblood Duke’s face, “Go tell Sispek’s family that this matter will come to a close here, I’m not going to pursue it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Most of those in the room looked sombre. Even though the Duke’s words seemed tough, he was admitting defeat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The next day, another public declaration caused chaos in Norland. The powerful Ironblood Duke effectively gave in to the Archerons, shocking the entire nobility of the plane!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ever since Richard made a display of his might, every one of his acts had been relentless and completely ignored customs and laws. Sharon’s disappearance had thoroughly enraged him, and the ferocious beast was baring his claws.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Orleans surrender didn’t stir up any emotion in Richard; when the news spread, he was in the Deepblue listening to a report from Professor Fayr. The parchment was discovered to have come from the royal family of the Sacred Alliance, manufactured exclusively for the ruler and their heirs. The dozens of beings had been found as well, all from the primal chaos of the void. These life forms couldn’t last in the ordered lands controlled by the Eternal Dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fayr adjusted the magical image they were looking at, picking out one sketch in particular of an earth elemental with a small body and huge head, “I feel like this could be the key.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What is it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It comes from a myth about the ancient races, a being known as the stonelord. An elemental with real flesh, it fuses the power of chaos and order within its body. But that makes it unable to live in most environments, restricting it to the boundary between order and chaos.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What is it good for?” Richard’s brows locked together. Everything on the parchment was etched into his brain, but the stonelord was the one exception. For some reason, his mental image of it always ended up a little fuzzy. Fayr had likely noticed this as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We have no use for it. Order is in the depths of our souls, and its primal chaos is toxic. Even an epic being might have their hearts explode if they eat it. However, it has an extraordinary ability to stimulate mutations.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hmm, then can Apeiron eat it? She uses the laws of chaos.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Her Majesty would meet the same end. She has no order left in her, so the venom would apply to her from the opposite direction. However, Her Excellency’s race is clearly ancient, and it was said that the stonelord was a delicacy that was key to the evolution of those races.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You don’t know the name of her race, do you,” Richard asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No,” the grand mage shook his head. Learning all this was already commendable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fortunately, Richard already had the answer himself. He nodded and took the parchment away, porting to Sharon’s demiplane and walking to the ancient library. Amongst the seven books he had read was one titled ‘History of the Primal Celestials.’</span></p>
