If they didn’t request military aid and refused to retreat, every warrior in the City of the Unsetting Sun would wind up dead, including the three legends at the helm. Short-term prophecies were rarely inaccurate, so everyone was left dumbstruck.</span></p>

The roars of Daxdians could be heard approaching from beyond the windows, forcing the old man to drag his exhausted body and get up. A delicate dagger in hand, he stared pointedly at the door; long since drained of mana, he could barely move about. He was no stronger than an ordinary old man, but the dagger would not leave him before his life.</span></p>

Everyone was taken aback by this news; it meant that the Emperor had given up his defensive advantage for a potential battle to the death. His loss would be a great blow to the entire Sacred Alliance and possibly to all of Norland.</span></p>

Even she couldn’t influence or even predict the ending of such a battle.</span></p>

Philip and his two guards were carried back to the Fort of Dawn, while the two Daxdians had been forced to retreat. One of the two normal legends amongst the enemies had been killed, and the&nbsp;other forced to retreat without the ability to even retrieve his companion's corpse.</span></p>

The message had omitted the most important part of it all; the seriousness of Philip’s injuries.</span></p>

The Sword Saint of the Millennial Empire had entered the Land of Dusk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>

An epic being was forced to retreat while two legends sustained heavy injuries. The soldiers of the Millennial Empire flooded into the dark wilderness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>

The woman was wrapped in a thick cloak from head to toe, only revealing a pair of bottomless eyes. The most memorable part about her was the enormous sword she had strapped horizontally across her back, a metre wide and almost four metres long. The sheathless sword that was disproportionate to her form was held in place by animal skin, but it seemed extremely stable on her back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even more surprising was the fact that this woman walked through the Millennial Empire as she liked. She passed through many strategic locations along the way, but nobody stopped her even once. Even the legendary being guarding the portal subconsciously cleared the path for her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Word quickly spread that Empress Gelan was in the midst of an afternoon nap. Of course, everyone knew that such excuses were only used to avoid meeting certain people. It was just that no one knew exactly who she was trying to avoid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two hours and fifty-five minutes before the end of the prophecy, the mysterious woman disappeared into the depths of the dark wilderness. Exactly forty-four minutes later, she had returned to the Millennial Empire and vanished quietly. The only difference seemed to be a few more nicks on her enormous blade, and an ominous aura of death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Azuresnow Shrine, she’s—” a saint suddenly closed her mouth halfway through the sentence. There were some names completely forbidden in the Millennial Empire, and the name of the former leader of the Azuresnow Shrine was one of them. It was this very woman that had completely subdued Prince Greyhawk’s army and then his heart, giving birth to Princess Mountainsea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Empress Gelan hadn’t seen her most beloved son ever since, only his daughter who had once come to visit.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>

Earl Goliath and Marquess Sauron caught sight of each other at the Ironblood teleportation gate, both noting that the other was fully armed battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“”You want to go too?”” They asked each other simultaneously, then grunting with annoyance, “”Do you want to die?””</span></p>

At this point, there was still an hour and fifty minutes before the prophesied time came to pass.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Powerhouses continued to rush towards the City of the Unsetting Sun one after the other, but even considering all of the Sacred Alliance the number of experts able and willing to participate in the war were scarce. Most of those who ended up going could only be called ‘experts’ in ordinary battles, not on the scale of the battlefields of despair, and even then a majority of those going weren’t doing so willingly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, not everyone was aware that the fourth and last of the epic-level Daxdians had already been sent retreating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>

Those who fought and killed with all their might had no clue about what was happening, and by now it was too late for any reinforcements to assist. The gathered experts from the other two empires could only rush in if the City of the Unsetting Sun fell, reclaiming it from the depleted Daxdians once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, there were 58 minutes to go until the end of the prophecy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within the core of the city, a saint’s sword suddenly hit the hard ground. The recoil caused him to gasp in pain, but he forced his arm to move and went into a defensive stance as he wiped away the blood that was covering his eyes. However, his eyes went wide as he realised that there was nobody in front of him. Hastily wiping his eyes once more and scanning around the nearby alleys, he nearly dropped his sword in surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those of his comrades who survived were the same. They watched in dazed disbelief as the enemy Daxdians ran away, not to their camps but far beyond into the dark wilderness. Finally, a difficult notion sprang up inside their minds:&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">had they just won?</span></p>
