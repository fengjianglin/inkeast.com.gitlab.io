 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline">3-1</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It is not impossible for Flowsand to return, but I suggest that you make certain it is the best ending for her,” the Eternal Dragon didn’t avoid the sensitive question, its answer stunning Richard a little, “When your own existence reaches new heights, you will realise that the emotions affecting a higher being are different. Simple happiness is completely meaningless; are you sure that you finding her will help her instead of hurt?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Richard was left speechless by this retort. He most certainly wasn’t a higher being, and he couldn’t really understand the difference.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just what did gods and archlords care about, what was important to them?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;He would have to think about this for a while.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It took a few minutes of silence before he spoke up again, “Then can I know about Sharon’s situation?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That is a question I cannot answer; it could harm the fundamental laws of my own existence.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two questions resulted in half of the divine grace fading away, despite neither being a truly satisfactory answer. However, Richard ignored that and continued, “I finished the Blood Path. Tradition should allow me to request the right to unlock one of the islands.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was something he had said for formality’s sake. When he left Faust, he had given up control of island 6-6. That control would have defaulted to the Eternal Dragon, who would then offer it to the next family that succeeded on their path. A brand of timeforce would serve as a key that allowed them to manipulate the island, passing it down according to tradition. He simply expected that the request to unlock an island would be refused, and the brand would be returned to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, that wasn’t what happened. Moments after his question, the Eternal Dragon’s voice rang out once more, “This grace is not enough to support such a request. Offer more, or recall it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This response was surprising, but thankfully he had more than enough offerings on hand. He quickly opened up a spatial ring and placed three more top-tier offerings on the altar, ones that he had originally planned to use for equipment supporting the reward point system. The sacrifices broke down into time force one after the other, flowing into the currents of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entirety of Faust shook, the Rainbow of the Moons glowing as a beam of light shot out from the Church of the Eternal Dragon to land on one of the floating islands. A protective barrier surrounding this island suddenly crumbled to reveal its interiors, and another beam shot down from it to the rainbow as it entered an orbit around Faust.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone in the city was alerted to this change, looking up from the streets or stretching their heads outside their window to stare at the massive island in the sky. The orbit of this island was far beyond anything else in Faust; there was an entire layer of sealed islands between it and even the next highest level!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One of the islands was being unlocked!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only a minority of long-lived veterans in Faust had actually witnessed the previous time an island had been unsealed, and Chairman Thor of the Mage Association was one of them. Standing before his window, he stared blankly as the island drew energy from the Rainbow of the Moons, the wineglass in his hand shattered without his knowledge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“H-How…” he rubbed his eyes forcefully, feeling like he was under an illusion. However, the sight before him truly was that of an island at the third layer, and it was even the first! He rushed back to his laboratory and spread out some paper, calculating the orbit to make sure. Repeated attempts only confirmed what his eyes had told him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Back at the Eternal Altar, Richard looked at the sphere of golden light that he had received with surprise. He had already expected an island to be unsealed for him with the Eternal Dragon’s previous statement, but that was only one of the remaining two islands in the fifth layer. He had never thought he would be granted access to 3-1.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was indeed an honour, and proof of his favour with the Eternal Dragon. However, the problem lay in the fact that such honour meant nothing to him; there was nothing much to higher layers of islands outside of surface area.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dragon seemed to read his mind, “The first three layers of islands are unique, this is a special reward. They grant the authority to control parts of Faust; you’ll know once you step foot upon the island.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Control Faust?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, consider this knowledge a part of your reward as well. Do your best to receive more grace, ascend to the top of the city. Once you reach the first layer, you will know the truth of this city. The same holds true for Flowsand’s return; the only path is to obtain immense amounts of grace. What you have now is nowhere close to what you need.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Feeling the conscient receding, Richard shouted anxiously, “How much do I need?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All he got in response was a laugh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The altar slowly returned to its ruined state, leaving a stunned Richard to pick himself up and depart the Church. For some reason, the dragon showed him more care than any others, but judging from how Philip and Ferlyn turned out that was definitely a bad thing. It was just that he always found it difficult to reject these offers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Noelene was waiting outside the altar, her gaze filled with a mix of happiness, envy, and even a pinch of fear. She nodded as he walked towards her, “Jacqueline wants to see you, she has things to say.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Richard frowned at the mention of the scheming priestess, recalling how her last attempt against him had ended. At that time, he had no idea what his title meant, only defending himself within reasonable limits. Now that he knew just how disposable she was, even if she didn’t realise this herself, he wouldn’t be as nice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What does she want?” he asked. He had no time to waste on someone whose only good point was her body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s about Ryan. He has mended his ways, and she feels like he is still the most suitable candidate to become Chosen. She wishes for your support.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Huh… And what do you think?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Noelene laughed bitterly, “Can we even interfere? Ryan has aptitude, but that doesn’t mean anything. She’s procured the support of ten different families, so there will be a ceremony to direct divine grace towards him very soon.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“She… Sigh,” he shook his head with a sneer, “She really thinks she can pressure me with the other nobles?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Inexplicable fear suddenly filled Noelene’s heart. She realised Richard’s attitude to this had changed completely from before; just standing there, the sense of oppression he was giving off was suffocating. It was only then that she remembered that none of the other nobles had dared to fight him on his Blood Path, and that he had even defeated Empress Apeiron herself.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How could someone like that be suppressed by a bunch of lesser nobles?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Richard continued, “Go call Ryan, and get Jacqueline and the others too. Let’s take care of it in one go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Noelene opened her mouth, wishing to say something, but no words came out. She could only turn around and carry out his orders, leaving Richard in the middle of the hall with all the frightened priests and paladins unsure of what to do. Some walked up to greet him as she left, but many others just sped away from the place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn’t long before Jacqueline and the two other grand priestesses were before Richard, accompanied by a Ryan who had outgrown much of his youth. The former prince was now taller, looking more mature and steadfast. He was still definitely a pretty boy, having inherited more from his mother’s side, but it wasn’t to the extent of Nyris who had looked devastatingly beautiful even before she transitioned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Richard, Ryan stepped forward and bowed, “It is an honour to be able to meet you again, Your Grace. The unprecedented glory of your Blood Path will definitely leave a splendid mark on the history of the Alliance. I wanted to ask forgiveness for the mistakes of my younger years. Many of the ancient families of the Alliance have been teaching me and helping me temper myself as of late, and I hope to learn from you as well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Richard glanced at Ryan, feeling an urge to applaud the boy for his performance. He clearly possessed talent as well, having gotten to level 18 in this short while. His words were calm and smart, showing the poise to admit prior mistakes but using that opportunity to point out that he had the support of several noble families. The hint was obvious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, such a threat was laughable to a Richard who was now strong enough to destroy the entire Alliance on his own. Ryan hid his hatred quite well, but not well enough to escape from Richard’s own eyes. Of course, Richard didn’t believe that a boy who had attempted to stab him at the tender age of twelve could ever truly be docile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Be it Jacqueline’s overbearingness in the past or Ryan’s flattery now, Richard understood that their only goal was the divine grace he could give them. He couldn’t blame them entirely— the rate at which he accumulated and spent offerings truly was insane— but that didn’t give him any respect for them either. He had made more than a third of Faust’s offerings even before he left, and now he certainly made more than all the other families combined. That made him a valuable ally, but that alliance had already been won by someone who was much more likeable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Richard looked into the youth’s eyes and laughed, “I don’t think you understand this yet. No matter how many families support you, you’re still nothing. This Chosen nonsense has been going on for so long now, I think it’s time to cut it off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Out.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">”</span></p>
