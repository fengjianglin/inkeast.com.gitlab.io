<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline">The Price Of Suppression</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Besides the pen, the case held three little potions. Rosie didn’t know what they were, but the magic crystal vials alone were worth tens of thousands of gold and showed just how expensive the contents would be. When she picked up an attached note and read it, her hands started trembling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The note was simple: “Mana Harmony Potion; legendary grade. For half an hour from consumption, one’s control over their mana is greatly enhanced.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These three bottles were basically priceless treasures for any runemaster; unlike Richard, many faced bottlenecks in stabilising their mana output. This mana harmony potion would greatly enhance their control, allowing them to jump the grade of rune they could create when used during a critical moment. Rosie was confident this would let her craft true grade 3 runes, taking her a long way along the path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, even that wasn’t the end of it. Below the three potions was a wand that was less than a metre long, loaded with three defensive spell slots that could also serve as a small mana bank for the holder. Next to it were two epic-grade rings and a bracelet. All in all, this would increase the mana she could call upon by a third and strengthen all her spells by a tenth. It also made for a total of seven defensive spells that could be cast in an instant; even if they were all grade 3, they would still greatly increase her ability to survive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We’re going to battle?” she asked after looking through it all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Richard nodded, “I’m planning to go to war with the gods this time, come with me. You won’t advance anymore without actual battles, I’m still waiting for you to become a grand mage.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Me too!” Rosie leapt up. Becoming a grand mage wasn’t just about mana or spell grades; her physique would change to the point that her life was extended. While the leaves of youth kept her looking twenty and the small amount of life blessing from Richard helped as well, such things only grew less effective with usage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Like them?” Richard smiled at her jumping like a child.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Of course I do!” she hugged him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Returning the embrace, Richard sighed, “I forgot about the flow of time; I should have visited you a few more times all these years. This present was long overdue.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not at all! You know how fast time flows when you’re crafting; it’s like I last saw you a few days ago. It’s fine!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was about to respond to the obvious lie, but she suddenly pulled back and pressed his mouth shut, a mischievous glint in her eyes as she whispered by his ear, “I have a present for you too. Close your eyes and don’t move!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rosie didn’t even give him a chance to object as she took out a silk cloth and covered his eyes, starting to kiss and touch all over him before slowly heading down. Richard shivered when she eventually found her target, sucking in a breath. A long time had passed in Faelor with Rosie’s magic and runecrafting improving by leaps and bounds, but she had clearly not forgotten her other skills either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Late in the night, Richard was on his back sweating profusely from the exertion, Rosie looking surprisingly lively having survived their most exhausting night yet as she was drawing circles on his chest. Moonlight was shining on them through the window, and feeling a cool breeze across his fatigued body Richard couldn’t help a wry smile. Even Rosie, who he had to be careful around before, could now keep up with him; it looked like the last bed he could win in was about to disappear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It felt like half a day later when Rosie spoke up in boredom, “Why the sudden crusade?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Richard sighed, “I need to take care of the issues here quickly, I don’t have much time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then what do you want? Influence? Strength? Something else?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Influence, strength… I want both, but that’s not the end goal.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now interested, she flipped over and put an arm on his chest, “Then what is?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The goal?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mm, are you still unsure?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Of course not!” he shook his head with a smile, “I thought of it long ago.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then? Tell me!” her eyes gleamed as the hand on his chest started crawling downwards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Richard trembled, but he suppressed his desire and shook his head, “I’ll tell you when you become a grand runemaster.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Grand runemaster…” Rosie’s smile suddenly grew dull, “Sigh, will there ever be such a day? I don’t… have the talent to become a grand mage.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This much was certainly true. While the Mensa Family had been wrong in misidentifying her talent at runecrafting, most of her achievements today still came from his guidance and her work ethic. If she were anywhere near normal, becoming a true runemaster would have been an enormous barrier in itself. Most families in Norland tested their core lineage thrice; birth, just before deciding on their class, and adulthood. Even the Archerons used their mages to test most of the family, with some of the most powerful warriors chiming in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Richard just chuckled and patted her face, “Don’t worry. I can’t promise more, but I’ll get you to level 18.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You mean the dragon… That’s so much money wasted!” Rosie grumbled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is it? Do you really think all your effort over these years isn’t worth at least that?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m already yours. You don’t need to compensate me for anything I do, it’s all yours.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“All mine, huh?” Richard smiled maliciously and hugged her hard, “Then shouldn’t you shut up and let me do what I want with you? If that means making you a grand mage, you don’t get to complain.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rosie glared at him for a moment, but then she put on a flustered expression as she bit at her lower lip seductively. Richard almost pounced on her immediately, but she shifted down herself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, he was left so exhausted he didn’t even want to move. For a moment, he felt like he would rather be in the Land of Dusk barely eking out victories over Daxdian saints.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Land of Turmoil would leave adventurers pale far before Richard’s rise, but in the dozen or so years since the Crimson Dukedom had been established many had cast their gazes towards the mysterious land of spatial rifts in the hopes of finding a secret passage to a new world. However, none of those that actually tried had returned, not even a full expedition led by a sub-legendary being. The enigma of this place had only grown with time, and it was now considered a forbidden land that not even the strongest beings of the plane would venture into.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A strange forest covered the heart of this land, the eerily synchronised swaying of the trees causing anyone to shiver in fright. Underground, one would find their roots penetrating a hundred metres into the earth to absorb every last drop of nutrition that could be found. At the centre of this forest were four enormous organic constructions that looked almost like beehives, but the most striking sight of all was a humongous insectoid creature that seemed to have raised its upper body as it stared towards the Crimson Dukedom with its dozens of eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Just you wait!” Zangru’s now-sweet voice resounded through the forest, “We’re not done here! I definitely won’t let you off if you don’t let me down right away!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Broodmother, I’m serious! Why aren’t you letting me down yet?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’ll have to put me down one day. I’ll show you what regret means when the time comes!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One could see Zangru on top of one of the nests, hanging from dozens of tendrils of various sizes as others with hollow tips were buried deep into him and drawing blood at a constant rate. He seemed to be in great pain, but there were occasions when his expression warped into a moan. Even otherwise, he didn’t look like someone whose blood was being drawn at all, extremely lively and shouting so loud that his voice travelled kilometres in each direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Still staring at the sky, the broodmother eventually deigned to answer, “Don’t you enjoy this?”</span></p>
