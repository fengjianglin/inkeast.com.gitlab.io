 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline">Acid Test</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Richard sat in his room with a minor headache, massaging his forehead as he thought about his rowdy daughter. Fiora technically wasn’t even a year old, but she was already a handful to deal with. Eccentricity was one thing, but she had a cunning to her that he could only chalk up to having grown up with the broodmother. However, she was also hot-blooded enough to truly be an Archeron, the combination of which would undoubtedly serve to hurt the prestige he had built up in Norland.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He sighed and put the matter aside, deciding to handle it calmly for now. He wrote down a few letters on magic paper and sent them out. Less than an hour later, both reward point battlefields were informed that the point system had been closed in Faelor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many powerhouses were confused at the news, unable to understand why Richard would suddenly cancel the battlefield in Faelor. Although none of them would choose to fight the reapers right now, some newcomers occasionally chose to try their luck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unless the reapers had been eliminated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those who managed to make the connection froze in place, unable to believe that thought. Some that had fled after near-death experiences even broke down upon hearing the news.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Were the reapers actually defeated? Weren’t they supposed to be the most frightening beings in existence?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Having fought the war machines themselves, these powerhouses knew just how dangerous this enemy was. Even the palm-sized warships were a headache to deal with, too fast to strike easily and capable of tearing holes in the average saint. The large ones were mechanical horrors that many wouldn’t even dream of defeating. Even if all the reapers were tied down and unable to retaliate, these saints would take years to destroy the largest warships.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The news was unbelievable, but the wording was clear and the imprint of the Archeron Family couldn’t be faked easily. One saint noticed a squad of rune knights heading towards the portal and stopped an old acquaintance, rushing over to hiss, “Did we really win?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The rune knight raised his head proudly, “Of course! We’re sending so many teams to tear down the reaper base now. Sorry, I’ve got to leave quickly; Captain won’t be happy if I’m slow.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The saint felt a strange sense of loss upon confirming the shocking news.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Would he have gotten better results if he’d stayed in Faelor?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;That question would never be answered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">News of the Archerons routing the reapers spread across Norland over the coming days, but the reaction this time wasn’t as obvious. Many lords fell silent as they heard the news, acknowledging it without much fanfare, but congratulatory letters flooded Richard’s study. Even knowing they would just be rejected, many nobles asked whether they could convey their regards in person; while the act itself seemed pointless, it was just one more way to endear themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Duke Orleans, Prince Tumen, the commander of the Sacred Tree Army, Archbishop Hendrick, Hidden Sword… All sorts of powerful characters reacted very mildly to the information, discussing it only for a few minutes before moving on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What could they even do at this point? Congratulate him?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Richard didn’t lack such a thing. What he’d needed were people like Asa and Greyhawk to help him through a critical period, and those like Calamity who joined the Archerons at their worst. Even someone like Romney who wasn’t of much use would be valued far more than anyone trying to suck up to them now; the saint assassin had actually put his life on the line to prove his loyalty. While those like him weren’t hard to come by, his actions were an integral piece of the puzzle that allowed for Richard’s success.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ever since Richard destroyed the Praton Family, the nobles of Norland had staunchly supported a military push to bring the Archerons down from their lofty throne. However, even in the worst moment of the war he had wiped out an imperial army that was 300,000 strong. With Sharon missing and Philip dead, he was now the premier powerhouse of Norland with the strongest army on the plane. Those like Duke Mensa could only hope they were insignificant enough for him to forget their feuds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reapers had been the best acid test of the Archeron war machine, and they had passed with flying colours. Now, any conflict with Richard was a death sentence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Richard was officially a part of the Sacred Alliance once more, it was the Millennial Empire that had the warmest response to his victory. Empress Gelan set up afternoon tea at her palace the very day the news spread, celebrating his achievement with some of the most important people in the country.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Alongside the Empress were Hidden Sword, Prince Tumen, and Princess Mina, her youngest daughter. However, the true stars of the gathering took a while to arrive, and when the steward opened the door for them Gelan’s hands started to quiver ever so slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the first time Greyhawk had returned to the Millennial Empire since he was captured all those decades ago, and equally his first appearance in front of her. The Empress had a lot to say and ask, but seeing her son and the woman who stole him away in front of her she found herself at a loss for words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brother!” It was the young princess who rushed over to him, burying her head into his chest, “Your hair…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Greyhawk’s long black hair truly was eye-catching, and had already left both the Empress and Hidden Sword lost in thought. However, he ignored the comment and smiled, “Look at you, almost as tall as me now! You couldn’t even speak properly when I left!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He then turned towards the Empress, hesitating for a moment before bowing with royal etiquette, “Mother.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gelan nodded, “You’re finally back. Don’t leave again this time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He’s coming back home with me,” Asa stated flatly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is that so?” Gelan’s voice remained dry, but she didn’t conceal her ridicule. Asa snorted and burst forth with bloodlust, but a deep green glow appeared in the depth of the Empress’s eyes even as Hidden Sword dissipated it all with two strokes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You think I’m scared because there’s two of you?” Asa scoffed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m more than enough to take care of you here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I could say the same in the Azuresnow Shrine, but I’m the one who dares to come and stand in your terrain.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sensing the situation had taken a turn for the worse, Greyhawk quickly pulled Asa aside even as he glanced at Mina, “There’s still a long time to go, and many opportunities in the future. Let’s forget it for now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mina ran behind the Empress and grabbed her shoulders eagerly, “It was so difficult for Brother to return, let’s not talk about this right now. I still want to hear how they defeated the reapers!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Standing by the side, Hidden Sword nodded solemnly, “Indeed, we need to assess the Archerons’ true strength. We can then decide whether to draw him in or subdue him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Subdue?” the Princess stuck out her tongue, “Don’t joke around, Uncle. You think you can beat Richard?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sword Saint froze up for a moment, but he still answered seriously, “How would anyone know if we haven’t yet fought? Besides, subduing him doesn’t necessarily require combat.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You mean like when you guys sent Macy? Didn’t he basically show no interest? It’s like I said before, that brat with no charm can’t seduce anyone. You might as well have sent me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hidden Sword actually choked on his tea at this straightforward statement, coughing a few times, “Well… Richard’s partners are truly powerful. You would have had no chance of victory.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m a level higher than Macy, my bloodline is purer, and my status is greater. I might not have battle experience, but you don’t need strength to seduce someone.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Empress Gelan finally lost her calm, rapping Mina’s forehead with the back of her hand, “How can you be so unreserved? This is the royal palace!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mina frowned, “What’s the use of reservation when it concerns my happiness? Richard isn’t like the trash that&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">some people&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">introduce me to every other day.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sensing her annoyance, both Hidden Sword and Prince Tumen turned away in embarrassment. One started coughing continuously while the other raised his head and stared at the ceiling.</span></p>
