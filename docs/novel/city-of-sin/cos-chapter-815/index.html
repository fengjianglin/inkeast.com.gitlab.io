I can use anything in these plains.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Richard nodded, “I’ll try my best to stay in control and not hurt you too much.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The barbarian youth was about to rage at that comment, but his eyes fell on Carnage and his eyes immediately narrowed, “That’s a good sword.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s a divine item.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No, it has to be more than that. Just a divine item wouldn’t feel so terrifying. You truly are a respectable opponent.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Carnage seemed to feel its presence in Klandor, the blade vibrating with excitement as a dark aura enveloped it. One could see goosebumps on Umur’s arms as he stared at the blade, while Balibali’s face was twitching. The tyrannosaur even just roared in fear and fell to the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fight began once more, and Richard side-stepped a punch before ramming Carnage’s handle into Umur’s rib. This should have been a powerful blow to a weak spot, but it felt like he had just slammed into a sheet of rock; his own hand started buzzing with pain, forcing him to fall back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The barbarian’s punches were extremely heavy. Richard dodged the ones he could, but every single one he had to deflect took a toll on his body. On the other hand, his own punches and kicks seemed to have no effect. Even a few boosted lightning bolts seemed to do nothing to him. Even worse, an invisible force field seemed to be growing in strength as the battle progressed; strikes that initially made contact were now being deflected before they even landed, and punches that should have been dodged were striking from even a metre away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Umur’s movements were quite simple, but Richard found almost no flaws to exploit in the flurry of blows. Even with his own advanced martial arts, there was almost no opening that he could wedge into, forcing him into a direct confrontation. Against someone with such defensive power, that was suicide.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only a few minutes into the battle, Richard had been hit several times. Although he had used his skills to lessen the blows, the injuries were starting to accumulate. On the other hand, Umur looked like a god of war as a giant phantom started growing out from his person. The phantom’s moves were perfectly in tandem with his, and as it grew more corporeal it became difficult to distinguish just who the actual person was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing the obvious end to this fight, Richard finally sighed and flipped Carnage around. He had been using the blade for defence all this while, but Umur left him with no choice but to get serious. He could feel the blade grow excited in response, the black aura converging back within in preparation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the eyes of the spectating Balibali, time seemed to speed up as shields of blue and white lightning started revolving around Richard’s body. Richard held Carnage up high with both hands, the blade pointed to the ground as he charged forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every movement seemed to leave an afterimage. Balibali couldn’t even keep up with Richard’s speed, and when his mind caught up once more all he could see was Richard squatting on the ground ten metres behind Umur. Blood was flowing down the corner of his mouth, dripping onto the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Umur remained in a punching posture, but he was looking down at his body with shock. A bloody mist burst out from the side of his abdomen, calling attention to a wound that was ten centimetres deep and nearly half a metre long. The barbarian studied the wound before looking at Richard once more, “That really is a good sword.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This kind of flesh wound was nothing to Umur, he could just clench his muscles to stop the bleeding completely, but he was well aware that his punch hadn’t even come close to Richard’s speed. The blood flowing from Richard’s mouth was only because he had restrained his power by force, avoiding any damage to the organs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You Norlanders really like your armour and weapons,” Umur commented again, “But then again, you’re even better than that blade of yours.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I want to continue,” Richard huffed, “But I can’t control myself like that again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s alright, you’ve already won. So— Hey!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“One sec! Today’s a good day, another old acquaintance is here!” Richard’s mocking voice faded into the distance as he dashed away, only leaving an afterimage behind. Umur wanted to chase behind, but speed was his one greatest weakness. There was no way for him to catch up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Far in the distance, the beast-like Heisa was making his way towards the battlefield. Having been interrupted in his ploy to kill Richard before and having grown much stronger since then, he wished to finish the job. His eyes went wide as he saw Richard rushing towards him voluntarily, but then he pulled a heavy mace off his back with a smirk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The mace didn’t even make it past his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sprinting over themselves, Balibali and Umur only saw an electric light flash before everything went silent. Richard was already ten metres behind Heisa, but this time there wasn’t even a flush on his face. A loud thud rang out as the mace fell to the ground, followed by the two halves of Heisa’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Carnage buzzed softly with satisfaction, as though it had just eaten the best meal of its life.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps it really had,</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Richard thought randomly.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He might have killed many stronger enemies in the Land of Dusk, but this was the first barbarian that he had struck down. After all, this blade was truly Klandor’s Carnage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Richard placed the blade back into his sword case before sprinting away, completely ignoring the two barbarians who realised just how easy he had been taking it on them. Having felt his sword cut through an enemy known for their bodily toughness as though he had been slicing butter, he suddenly had some doubts about the situation.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Had the Eternal Dragon known it would come to this? Was that why he had been given Carnage and the upgrade to it?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>

However, Richard strived to maintain his patience throughout the journey— he had learnt in the Land of Dusk that urgency against a strong enemy would only result in death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A few days later, right on the border of the plains and the rolling mountains, he came across a huge old tree with an abnormally tall black tyrannosaur underneath, a barbarian woman next to it leant against the bark while wiping her sword. She was an entire foot taller than him, her sword alone just as large as his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Richard frowned at the sight; he could feel that this would be his first true challenge since he arrived. Bringing Carnage out of the case, he started walking towards her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman looked up and down Richard, scanning over his now-local attire and the blade in his hand before asking hoarsely, “Richard?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My name is Krangma, I am a senior warrior of the Azuresnow Shrine.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I can see you’re quite powerful. I assume you’re here for the tooth as well?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In part, yes. My main purpose in coming here is to test your skills. Defeat me, and I will give you the qualifications to participate in the holy ceremony. If not, return the Tooth and return to Norland.
