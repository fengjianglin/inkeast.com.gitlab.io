He recalled something Sharon had told him about the Deepblue Dream: it was something that showed one the truth of the world, giving one a greater intuition for the future. She couldn’t explain just why this was, but she did know that this intuition would grow stronger the more accomplished one was. He hadn’t really tackled the question back then, and now his master was asleep even if he wanted to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He forced himself to calm down and stood up, but even so his heart remained restless. Feeling sweat dripping down his palms, he looked down to find that his fingertips were as red as blood! Lifesbane had been activated without him even consciously meaning to!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There could only be one explanation for this: his intuition was erupting with killing intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He quickly checked his body inside out, but there were no abnormalities at all. His bloodlines were fine, and the power of his truename still lay dormant as well. All rationality was telling him he was just feeling off-put for some reason.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And yet, he couldn’t bring himself to let go. His heart was still beating quickly, as though something extremely bad was about to happen. Shaking his head, he simply spread all of his equipment on the floor and started cleaning them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Lawrence came in, he found Richard sharpening Carnage and raised a brow in confusion; divine weapons didn’t exactly need to be maintained. He took a step back, asking cautiously, “Boy, what is it you want to kill?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Richard looked up at the old man, growing a little confused himself, “Why are you standing so far away?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lawrence actually retreated a couple more steps in response, “You’re radiating bloodlust. It feels like you’ll cut me down if I come within ten steps!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Richard laughed, “Why would I do that?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who knows? Maybe you just don’t find me nice to look at,” Lawrence desperately shook his head, “I cherish my life!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sigh… I do feel irritated for some reason, as if something bad is about to happen. But… I can’t say you what it is.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mage’s intuition,” Lawrence turned solemn, “If you feel it so heavily, then it must be something bad. I can’t help you, but here’s a suggestion: if you’re going to do something reckless, tell the royal family first. Also describe Mana Armament’s powers to Philip, just its power and abilities should be enough. He’s now famous in all of Norland, his support will ensure that some unscrupulous people don’t attack you directly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I will,” Richard said seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, kid,” Lawrence sighed, “I’m old now, this advice is all I can give you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Richard shook his head, “That’s eno—”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Right! I have some materials here, enough to make the ornamental runes. Finish them off before you go, with your ability it should only take a day. You can never be prepared enough.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The smaller components really were quite simple, but without the ability to calm down Richard made a host of mistakes in the process. It took an entire two days for him to finish, after which he heaved a sigh of relief and activated them immediately. Thankfully, these runes were nearly no burden to the bearer, depending purely on Mana Armament itself; he was already straining the limits of his carrying capacity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as he was about to test the new effects, he suddenly felt a bit of heat at his chest from the beast teeth that Mountainsea had given him. What was once a bracelet had been turned into a necklace for convenience, and the ornament that had been quiet all this while finally flashed with light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His heart trembled as he picked out a piece of shell in the middle, reading the words written upon it in cyan light, “Take me away.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The handwriting was something that he could recognise anywhere, and the shell’s functions had already been described to him before. As the cyan light dimmed and the shell turned to ash, he felt his heart almost come to a stop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Take me away…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He couldn’t begin to imagine just what meaning lay behind this sentence, what had pushed someone as strong as Mountainsea to ask him to come before their agreement. However, he had already prepared himself for something earth-shattering to occur, and since she had called him over he would go to Klandor again if it cost him his life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The barbarian continent that wasn’t much smaller than Norland, with the locals who had their own inheritance of totemic warriors that were no worse than mages. A princess born of a failed invader and the saintess of the Azuresnow Shrine, destined to carry the avatar of the Beast God…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The last time he stepped into Klandor, Richard had been a weakling. Now, he was a grand mage who had spent years tempering himself in the Land of Dusk. Of course, the enemies he met this time would be entirely different as well. Most of those he had encountered previously had refrained from killing him for Mountainsea’s sake, but now that she was calling for him there would be no such luck anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But then again, he wasn’t thinking of luck as Carnage flashed out of the sword case, landing in his hands. Stroking the blade softly, all he could feel was the murderous intent brimming within himself. He looked towards the magic case that already held the required equipment and supplies; he was prepared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had to leave right away!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Richard instinctively took a step forward, but then he remembered that there was still one thing for him to do. Convincing himself that he could wait a mere ten minutes, he rushed back to his desk and scribbled out a number of letters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The first two were for Emperor Philip, one mentioning that he was going to Klandor to pick up Mountainsea and the other detailing the effects of the grade 4 Mana Armament. Following that were letters to Sharon, Waterflower, Alice, Gangdor, Rosie, and even Senma and Asiris detailing their tasks for the near future and preparing them for any eventualities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was only when it came to Flowsand that he couldn’t figure out what to write, staring blankly at the empty page for more than two minutes. Eventually, he only managed a single sentence that comprised of two words:</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">I’m sorry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sighing softly, he folded the letter and started to place it in an envelope. However, before putting it in with the rest he remembered one more thing and opened up the letter once more, adding another sentence: “Careful of the broodmother.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The broodmother came from the Eternal Dragon, and the old dragon almost certainly had his ways to control her. She wasn’t difficult to deal with yet, a proper legendary being could kill her if they knew how to do it, but just like Io and Nyra she was no ordinary being. Of course, he couldn’t compare her to other broodmothers because he hadn’t seen one, but he felt like there had to be something special about her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at the stack of letters on the table, he found his faith starting to shake. He wondered if going to a foreign continent to steal away their princess was the right choice at all; every letter was a heavy responsibility on his shoulders, and he was basically throwing them all away for one. His blessings screamed at him that this was an extreme risk, and that he should actually recruit a few legendary beings with promises of runes before threatening the Azuresnow Shrine to hand her over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But that was a process that took time. He didn’t know what had happened to Mountainsea, but she had suddenly used the shell a long time before he was supposed to return. He could afford to wait,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">but could she?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Land of New Heroes was really powerful, a number of experts hidden within its depths. Greyhawk had been a generational prodigy himself, but his landing force had been completely subdued in one engagement. For a mere grand mage to wish to take on the entire continent was begging for death.</span></p>
