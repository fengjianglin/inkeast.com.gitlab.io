 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Duke Bevry had already wiped out all the small opposing fiefs nearby, leaving only those nobles who had a strong backing. Many nobles of the Sequoia Kingdom were already voicing vehement opposition to his act of destroying an earl of the Whiterock Dukedom, and the royal family was inclined to agree. If the Direwolf Duke took over the entire Whiterock Dukedom, then he would become the largest of threats to their existence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Still, there was nothing they could do. It was a long time ago now that the King had aided the Mage Association’s war against Richard despite knowing of his affiliation with Bevry. When the Association had been completely decimated at Richard’s hand, their own standing had dropped considerably.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bevry was currently winning battle after battle, but when it came to the unresolved issue of his son he felt greatly exhausted and helpless.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He seemed to have luck on his side now, but what about the next battle and the one after that?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Richard didn’t directly answer the Duke’s question, “Right now, the one thing I can be certain of is that the Goddess of Time Runai was the one behind Perrin’s problem.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The implied meaning was that there were only two ways to salvage Perrin’s situation. Either Runai had to withdraw her curse, something that had never occurred in history, or she had to be forced off her divine throne. It felt like the second was a choice of madmen, but with Richard’s arrival Bevry actually saw a glimmer of hope.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The day will come when I have to go against a deity…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">the Duke silently pondered, his thoughts calming down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for Richard, he continued to stare down at the nightly scene as he wracked his mind to determine which of his enemies this was. Thinking over it, he realised he had very many enemies wishing for his death. Almost everyone from the planes he was invading was opposed to him by default, and his greatest inheritance from Gaton was the number of enemies in Faust.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Schumpeters, Mensas, Josephs…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His mind suddenly wandered to thoughts of his father. The man had innumerable enemies, most of the recent years of his life spent embroiled in war and expansion.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Why had he only brought thirteen rune knights into Faust? Why had he waged war against four great families at the same time over the disappearance of his son? Why was it that he spared no expense for victory, accumulating a debt as high as the sky from Sharon?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He felt like he finally understood these things now. That man had never taken these so-called enemies seriously. To him, they were just pebbles on his path. Nobody could know the true extent of his ambitions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His own true enemies were not on Norland at all. A huge shadow loomed over Mountainsea in the snowy peaks of the Azuresnow Shrine, and a horde of nightmare creatures was waiting for him in the void. Even someone as powerful as Sharon was just left drifting, lifeless…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Richard suddenly felt like the entire universe was just an illusion. His thoughts suddenly weaved between truth and fiction, forcing him to blink a few times to recover.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His gaze now was a little more profound.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These people were not his enemies, just small stones for him to step over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A gentle breeze blew past the quiet and peaceful night, but a powerful murderous aura started to shroud the entire hill…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hurried footsteps suddenly rang out below the stone wall, the soldiers by the entrance announcing the arrival of Duke Grasberg and Countess Katrina. Moments later, the two new arrivals appeared at the top of the stronghold as well. Grasberg was dressed in a greyish-black armour, and Countess Katrina had switched to her own exquisite equipment instead of her standard skirt. The slight killing intent added a surprising element of beauty to the woman, but despite being more reserved than the duke beside her she outshone a powerful warrior like Anna nearby.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only now did Richard realise that this was Katrina’s real face.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How could a woman who only sought pleasures in bed be able to create an elite force?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was his first time meeting Duke Grasberg. This fellow was known for his scheming, but despite being an enemy of Bevry’s he had mobilised two-thirds of his personal army to aid Richard’s cause. Over 10,000 men had already arrived, and an equal number were on their way. All of his finest soldiers had been sent to aid in this battle, something that left Richard rather surprised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Duke Grasberg was a tall, skinny man, his head full of white hair combed down neatly and the wrinkles on his face seemingly carved in by a knife. However, this old man shared one trait with the younger Duke Bevry: a pair of wolf-like eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Zim had sent word that Grasberg would be sending his army over to join the alliance, Richard hadn’t expected the Duke to come personally. He walked over to the man and smiled, “Your Grace! What a pleasant surprise!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Grasberg returned the gesture, “I hope this will make that boy more obedient and keep him home.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Richard nodded with understanding. Continuing the bloodline was an important matter to any family; the war against the invaders was simply too dangerous, an unknown number of country guardians had perished in the previous battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Grasberg looked at the Direwolf Duke who still remained silent, “It’s only us two old fellows who can still fight in the kingdom. I’ve placed everything I have on you, Richard, I wanted to see this personally.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Richard flourished his arms at the fortress, “This is what I have for now, does it put your mind at peace?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Grasberg looked down and surveyed the area, able to make out the defensive strength of the location despite the dim light of the torches. His brows relaxed, “You have yet to disappoint.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Richard continued to smile, not saying another word.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Duke then looked around at everyone atop the stronghold. Every time his gaze landed on someone new, he seemed to be shocked inwardly. Bevry was an enemy he was familiar with, a sub-legendary expert just like himself that had fought him multiple times both personally and by proxy. It was no problem to ally with him in a war against outsiders. However, this time he felt something different about this old nemesis of his, a new power he could not quite pin down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And yet, that wasn’t the surprising part. None of Richard’s followers seemed high in level, but all of them had a suppressive aura. When his gaze landed on a female mage in a gold mask standing right behind Richard, his pupils constricted as though needles were piercing his eyes. Tears trickled down his face as he was forced to blink.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bevry suddenly spoke up, “We can’t use our normal expectations to judge these followers of his, I’m afraid.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Grasberg inhaled deeply, nodding his head as his eyes returned to normal. Veins started bulging in his eyes, soon turning it bloodshot. His secret technique to perceive another’s strength was much more powerful than Bevry’s, more accurate, but there was a price to pay whenever he tried to scan someone more powerful than himself. Fortunately, he wasn’t being hostile and Lina hadn’t retaliated; the final result was only a minor injury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Duke then regained his composure, “I bring some bad news. The expedition from the royal family met the invaders this morning for a second round of battle. Despite their advantage in numbers, they were destroyed. Even the five grand mages of the Association perished.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The royal family, just like Duke Grasberg, was a party that had constantly suppressed Bevry’s rise. However, the Direwolf Duke was not happy at this loss of theirs, an icy chill entering his heart. While the army for this expedition hadn’t been large, all of them were elites. “How many in total?” he couldn’t help but ask.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“70,000,” Grasberg said with a bitter smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bevry’s eyes narrowed, voice turning a little hoarse, “All 70,000 dead? Didn’t the invaders fight a bloody battle just yesterday?”</span></p>

First off, these invaders had destroyed the Baruch Kingdom’s army that had more than 100,000 men and killed most of its sub-legendary experts in one fell swoop. And only one night of rest later, they had killed another 70,000 elites formed by an alliance of the Sequoia Kingdom.</span></p>

Once the tides of battle turned firmly in one side’s favour, the losers would lose morale quickly. Even the most disciplined of armies would crumble and flee, forget this temporary alliance that was already filled with fear. On top of that, grand mages could normally leave a battlefield whenever they pleased. However, a whole five of them had been forced to remain.</span></p>

It seemed like the blade of this invasion could cut through whatever point it focused on.</span></p>

They couldn’t count on the little dukedoms in between to delay these attackers at all.</span></p>

Before the second battle, they had approximately 16,000,” Grasberg replied.</span></p>

If I were to lead 16,000 elite soldiers against that 70,000-strong army, what do you think of my chances of victory?”</span></p>
