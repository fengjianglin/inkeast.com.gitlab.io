 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline">Trouble</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Richard nodded at Apeiron’s question, his attention brought back to a menu placed on the table in front of her. Dozens of dishes were written on it, a single page not enough to list them all, but it looked rather old. He recalled a rumour that the Emperor didn’t change the menu for years at a time during his rule.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I haven’t looked around yet. Keep me company, the two of you,” the Empress said as she stood up. Pale gold light shining in from the window behind her, the silhouette of her face looked quite graceful and rather frail.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Richard and even Julian himself were surprised, the former bowed slightly with perfect etiquette to acquiesce. Of course, the latter’s obedience was never in question; Julian would follow her anywhere across the endless void without hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The royal palace was enormous with hundreds of rooms of varying sizes, but Apeiron made sure to look at every single corner. Sometimes she hurried through the maze-like corridors, while other times she stood still without moving for minutes on end. She didn’t seem to have any appreciation for the rare artefacts, instead spending ages fiddling around with rusty iron helmets and weapons. It took some time, but Richard finally realised that she was stopping at all the bloody spoils of war that should have been placed by Emperor Philip; she was lingering around wherever he had stopped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They continued to walk around throughout the day, only done when it was almost dinner. Apeiron ambled into Philip’s favourite dining hall to find dishes already laid out on the table, with the maids and a minister lying in wait. Taking a look around, she sized up the hall. Richard’s own gaze fell to the familiar food; this was the exact same meal the late Emperor had treated him to as a reward; the nearly raw dragon rib was a specialty he would never forget.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Empress eyed up the minister, who flashed a charming smile and bent so low it seemed like his back would break, “Please eat, Your Majesty; the soup will turn cold soon. If you do not like the flavours, I will have things changed promptly! If you will it, I can cook myself so long as you don’t mind me being out of touch.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How many years have you been with Philip?” Apeiron asked softly, “I seem to remember you being in the palace even before I left.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The minister froze, a hint of sadness flashing across his face that was quickly hidden away, “I had the fortune of being His Majesty’s aide for 29 years, Your Majesty.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“29 years? That’s quite a long time. I heard Philip granted you an earldom, why are you still here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“His Majesty was injured soon after the land was conferred to me,” the minister explained, “I was afraid a new hire would not be attend to his tastes well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Apeiron nodded, “Then you’re a Marquess now, you’ll get more land from the imperial territories. You can retire after tonight.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The minister immediately froze up once more, his head hanging low before he answered in a cracked voice, “Thank you… Your Majesty.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’ll be taking his place,” Apeiron turned to Julian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It will be my honour!” Julian immediately puffed out his chest, seeming truly elated at being assigned the role of an aide.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Empress sat at the head of the table and waved Richard over, “Take a seat, let’s eat together! This might be the last time we share a meal.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Richard sat calmly and asked, “May I know the reason?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Apeiron smiled, “This will be the only day I’m normal. By daybreak tomorrow, I’ll be back to how I was before.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn’t press further. If she were willing to explain, she would. He was already on guard from her actions the day before, and this day of normality wouldn’t lull him into carelessness. He immersed himself in eating just like her, knowing that every dish here was amazing. Even now, one of these meals would be a considerable boost to his physique.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was as though Apeiron hadn’t eaten in several lifetimes. The food disappeared down her mouth, the raw meat stuffed in so fast that she almost compared to Philip himself. The minister didn’t find this strange at all, while Julian stood solemnly by the side. Although his eyes glowed with desire for the dragon meat, he stood there without moving like a dog waiting for his master to throw him a bone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Empress ate and ate, but at some point her movements suddenly slowed down. In only a few minutes, she was staring blankly with a large helping of dragon meat in her mouth. The minister glanced at her from the side and saw a slight shimmer at the corner of her eyes, immediately ducking his head while afraid to look again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Richard obviously noticed it as well, but he decided to pretend to not notice the tear as well. He continued to engross himself in eating, eyes focused on the steak as though the raw flesh was the prettiest of paintings. Apeiron eventually started eating again, but she had trouble ingesting the meat in her mouth. She chewed and chewed but was unable to swallow, eventually resorting to stuffing it down with her fork.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Richard continued to play ignorant to it all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Having dealt with the food, Apeiron placed her fork and knife down and sat up, “Call all the concubines and the children back to the islands. No matter where they are now, they should be back by daylight tomorrow.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“As you wish,” Julian bowed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She then looked at Richard who was still eating with all his might, “Enough, stop pretending. You can’t eat anymore, can you? Just let it be.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Richard sighed and put his cutlery down, looking back up to see Apeiron looking him in the eye, “You’re afraid of me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Of course,” he answered honestly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Empress sighed, “You should be. Those who don’t know fear can’t tell the opponent’s true strength. So much stronger than Philip’s children, and a runemaster too, right? Who taught you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Her Excellency Sharon,” he said briefly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sharon?” Apeiron was surprised, “She hasn’t left the Deepblue yet? How is she?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before Richard could answer, Julian took a step forward and whispered something in her ear. He had clearly put in hard work to learn the current situation in the Sacred Alliance; while he was violent and acted like a dog, he was still useful for more than fighting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Empress listened to everything before looking back at Richard, her dark purple eyes suddenly lighting up as her expression changed, “You really are her student. Less than thirty, but you’ve already pushed the Deepblue Dream so far. You’re much stronger than that Voidbones or whatever he was.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Richard’s gaze immediately turned cold, “You’ve met Voidbones?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She nodded, “He lived in the Outlands for a while. He was quite the brat when he got there, but a few beatings brought him in line. It’s just that there aren’t many humans there, or even humanoids; I didn’t want to kill him. Julian’s been drooling over him for ages.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s common to starve for months at a time in the Outlands. Anything with meat is considered a delicacy,” Julian supplemented, expression not changing at all. It sounded rather trivial, but between the two Richard gained some understanding of the harsh conditions in the Outlands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You have a feud with him?” Apeiron suddenly asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes,” Richard answered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then you’re in trouble. He just reached Norland and is currently in the Deepblue. Apparently, Sharon is hibernating?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Richard shot up, but then he calmly bowed, “Many thanks for the warning, Your Majesty. I will never forget this favour. Forgive me for being unable to accompany you; I need to head over immediately. Since he wants to die, I need to oblige him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Empress actually smiled rather sweetly, “You’d be in trouble. He didn’t come alone, and judging from the aura the person that came with him would cause me trouble as well. You’re no match.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I appreciate your intentions, Your Majesty,” Richard said with a nod, “However, I need to leave regardless.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then I won’t keep you,” she stated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Richard immediately charged out of the palace and opened a short-distance portal, flashing over to the Archeron island and tapping Waterflower on the shoulder as he ran into his room. He didn’t have the time to explain the situation to his followers, so he immediately sounded the war horns.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">……</span></p>
