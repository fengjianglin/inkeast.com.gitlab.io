What ‘women’ were in that godforsaken place anyway? There were only killers, male or female.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll… see to it,” he said reluctantly. It wasn’t possible to turn down such a trivial request.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Excusing himself for a moment, he sent someone to gather his followers from Faelor before returning to the back hall. Without any pressing issues, he happily spent time talking with Ferlyn about the exploits of her past. After a few rounds, he asked to switch to wine instead. The alcohol shed all of his inhibitions, and he started chatting heartily with her like they were old friends.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re becoming bolder and bolder,” she said mysteriously at one point, “just like your father when he was young.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m just trying to please you,” he replied sheepishly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“For Flowsand?” she asked with a faint smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, sorry.” At this point, he started blushing red. The year spent mingling with commoners in the Land of Dusk had really dulled his sensibilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is that so? I know everything about you. You went to Klandor and almost got yourself killed for Mountainsea, and for Sharon you went to a battlefield of despair in a heartbeat. What about Flowsand? What does she mean to you? What do you plan to do with the three of them?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Richard was a little surprised; not by the fact that she had managed to find out— after all, she was someone who could even peek into the past— but by the fact that she was interested enough to look. Her questions were hard-hitting as well, causing him to look down in shame. He didn’t notice her glancing at a figure behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I… I…” he tried hard to find words but constantly fumbled. His hands started digging into the flesh of his calves in frustration.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Tell me what you think of Flowsand. Why didn’t you want to see her before you went off to the Land of Dusk?” Ferlyn pressed on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m not sure…” Richard took a deep breath and raised his head, “I’m not sure who’s more important to me, Master, Flowsand, or Mountainsea. I would give up everything for any of them, but it was just circumstance that I ended up having to go to Klandor and the Land of Dusk. If I had gone to see Flowsand, I might not have had the courage to go. I couldn’t let that happen.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Ferlyn still didn’t give up, “Then which one of the three is most important to you? If they were to fight, who would you side with?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was another pointed question that he had never even thought about. However, he now had no choice but to say something, so he thought for a long time and poured quite a few cups of wine down his throat before speaking apologetically, “Sorry, this needed a bit of courage. I think…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was at that point that he suddenly sensed something, turning to look back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Flowsand was at the door, having lost all of her normal beauty. Her skin was so pale that it could blend into the wall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If she were to leave him for good, the absence would be suffocating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Richard stood up in shock, but before he could even speak she had pounced forward and sealed his mouth with a kiss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It took an entire minute for him to break away, finally managing to get some words out, “You’re back so soon?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, she cupped his mouth and huffed, “Wait, let’s talk later. Head out for a bit, I have to speak to this old woman!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Richard was puzzled, but before he could say anything Flowsand just pushed him out of the hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You old hag!” Flowsand was raging at Ferlyn, her body wound up like a lioness ready to pounce on an intruder, “What were you trying to do, asking all those questions? Why did you have to tell him about us?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ferlyn continued to smile gently, “Look at you, so impatient. I almost got him to say the truth, but you just had to interrupt. Isn’t that what you always wanted to know?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These words seemed to pierce right into Flowsand’s heart. All of the tension faded away and she slumped to the floor, crying with her head in her hands, “I don’t want to know any more! So what if I knew, what difference would it make? If… if… Whatever, I just don’t want to know!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The question had constantly on her mind, surfacing time and time again. However, she had concluded that it didn’t matter at all.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So what if she mattered the most to him, would he give up on Sharon and Mountainsea? And what if he didn’t even care for her, could she bring herself to leave?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a question that was best left unanswered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ferlyn walked over, stroking her hair, “You’re a very smart girl, but too stubborn. But that’s alright, I will help you. Even if one is a powerhouse amongst legends and the other is the princess of Klandor, it doesn’t matter.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Flowsand continued to cry in Ferlyn’s embrace, constantly wiping away her tears, “I know he needs to get stronger. I know he’s doing it because of me, at least partly. But that’s not what I want! I just… I just…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You just want him to come home safe,” Ferlyn sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Flowsand broke down further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two ladies stayed in a silent embrace. They were the pride of Norland on any other day, but now they were no different from peasants wishing their beloveds a safe return. However, like most men, Richard and Philip were clueless and just did things their way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Richard was starting to get restless when the door suddenly opened and Flowsand walked out. She wrapped herself around his arm and said happily, “Come, let’s go to the altar. What stuff did you get?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’d never guess!” Richard beamed. This one moment was worth the entire year of battles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then there must be a lot!” she clung even tighter to his arm, her ample bosom constantly grinding against him. It took an inordinate amount of effort to keep himself from having a physical reaction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So?” she whispered softly in his ears, literally hanging off him at this point, “How many offerings do you have?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a runemaster who was also killing countless enemies in a battlefield of despair, Richard had accumulated a number of offerings over the past year. In fact, he now had more top-tier offerings than Beye did. His response was instant, but Flowsand’s words right after turned his pride into absolute fear: “Okay then, that’s the number of times you’re making love to me today.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ceremony was held immediately, and it took an exceptionally long time. The priestesses outside started to burn with jealousy as time went on, clearly realising just how much grace Flowsand would receive. However, Richard himself was filled with dread despite the numerous blessings he had received.

The bow was extremely powerful as well; combined with the two tracking arrows, it would be the death of any grand mage. However, that would have to wait until Olar or someone else was powerful enough to use it.</span></p>
