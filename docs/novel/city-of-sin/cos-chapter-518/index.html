 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The battle with the treants ended soon after Richard’s powerhouses arrived. However, the battle had left a logging team of 200 men with less than 50 survivors. Richard himself only managed to make it to the location afterwards, unable to help but sigh at the aftermath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pamir was squatted beside the corpse of one of the treants, examining its rings. He stood up soon after Richard’s arrival, “All of them are level 14, elites even in Norland. If only they were two levels higher… Tch, they would have had hearts.” The grand mage had a look of pity on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The saint Scherr kicked the corpse of one of the treants, “These things are valuable anyway.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Treants were moving treasuries, their core wood one of the best choices when creating superior-grade longbows. At level 16 they developed hearts where their life essence coagulated; these hearts had a wide range of uses, making them more valuable than the rest of their bodies combined. Still, even these corpses would be worth at least 10,000 gold each back in Norland.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A big part of the reasons humans in Norland had attacked the elves was to obtain high-quality hearts. They were so powerful the heart of a legendary treant could be used to formulate medicine to increase one’s lifespan. This was a temptation enough to drive anyone crazy; unlike the randomness of the Eternal Dragon’s divine grace, alchemy had known effectiveness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nyris approached Richard’s side, looking at one of the corpses, “So many treants were sacrificed to capture a single hostage, the elves are really going all out. It seems like that little druid isn’t as simple a character as we thought.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mm,” Richard nodded, “Have Olar monitor him carefully, and get a priest to watch over so he doesn’t kill the boy off by accident.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nyris fell into thought for some time before asking, “The elves should ask to exchange hostages soon. Is your knight… Erm… Important?” The implicit meaning was that they could take action while exchanging hostages, but that would put the knight’s life in danger. Of course, such a sacrifice was worth it in the eyes of the Fourth Prince; he had no lack of level 11 knights.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Whether he’s important or not depends on how you look at it,” Richard replied profoundly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nyris frowned, unable to understand what that meant. He decided to just ask directly instead, “Are we taking action when the elves come to negotiate?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No, we’re taking action now.” Richard’s words caused Nyris to look at him with anticipation, and he smiled in response, “Go, gather your men, but don’t bring more than thirty. We’re leaving soon, and we need to stay flexible.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No problem!” Nyris answered. As a prince in the running for the throne, he had a lot of competent subordinates. Besides, he had Agamemnon as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It didn’t take long for a small troop to be assembled in the city square. Richard took Lina, all of his followers, and all five of the rune knights along, while Nyris and Agamemnon brought Scherr, Pamir, and a selected group of guards that were all level 14 at minimum. This squad had the power to fight their way out even if they were surrounded by a big army.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Richard was not anxious to set off, instead meticulously checking on everyone’s equipment and rations. He then mounted his unicorn, “Be prepared, we might have to spend a few days in the forest.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that moment, a slender silhouette suddenly ran towards the square, “Wait! Bring me along!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Demi’s fiery figure, Richard’s face sank, “I’m attacking the elves’ nest directly this time. It will be extremely dangerous, this is not a joke!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Demi’s face lit up, “When have Archerons ever been afraid of danger!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You don’t have the ability, and there’s nobody willing to take care of you. This is not an excursion.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ve been in many wars already, I don’t need a caretaker. I’m an Archeron, not a little chick that needs its mother all the time!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing her refuse to back down, Richard couldn’t find it in himself to be annoyed. The girl had outstanding strength, progressing rapidly during their numerous battles back in Faelor. As a cursemaster her defensive abilities were already great as well. It was just that there was still a little bias deep in his heart. With Gaton having disappeared, he didn’t want the man’s children to suffer from any mishaps. Even if they grew to be a pride of tamed lions, it was better than them dying on another plane.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(33, 33, 33); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even amongst powerhouses, less than half of those who spent a long time in planar war survived. There were many who died in foreign lands before they even had that chance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Demi’s persistence reminded him of his younger self. He sighed, “If you want to go, then go get changed out of these red robes. I don’t care where you get the new clothing, but you have five minutes to do it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The girl didn’t hesitate, rushing out immediately. Looking at her departing figure, Richard sighed a little. If a lion didn’t want to enjoy the safety of its cage, then it had to be returned to the magnificent danger of the savanna.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most of the soldiers were out patrolling the city, but three warriors were sitting around lazily as they talked about home. They were shocked when Demi dashed into their room in the barracks, but immediately stood up to salute her. They knew that this fiery young lady was Richard’s blood sister.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Demi sized the three of them up, suddenly pointing one out and saying with a sweet smile, “You, come closer.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The warrior pointed to immediately moaned, “Me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who else?” she maintained her expression, pulling down on her collar to reveal almost the entirety of her breasts. The soldier immediately walked over without even thinking about it, the fair skin the only thing on his mind. His heart was beating so fast it was ready to spill out of his mouth. He didn’t see the pommel of a dagger smashing into him from behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The warrior swayed, eyes rolling back as he fell to the ground in disbelief, and Demi immediately started to remove his clothes. The other two soldiers were dumbfounded, unable to comprehend what they had just witnessed. However, they didn’t think Demi’s attack was an act of hostility. Thinking she just had some unusual preferences, they started looking forward to the scene they were about to witness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One that never materialised. Once done stripping the warrior down to his underwear, Demi cut a big hole into her skirt. Raising her head to see them still looking at her, she cast a pair of fear spells that sent them running with a cry. Not bothering with them any further, she tore off her skirt and quickly changed into the soldier’s uniform before dashing out of the room and the barracks. The unconscious soldier wouldn’t know until he woke up that Demi had chosen him merely because of their similar physiques.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">……</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Still sitting on the unicorn, Richard was silently counting the seconds as they passed by. He knew Demi loved red, and also that she hadn’t prepared any clothes for this expedition that weren’t robes. In the jungle where mobility was paramount, one needed to be dressed in trousers to be fully effective.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were exceptions to this, of course— Lina was so powerful normal terrain posed no obstruction to her regardless. However, he himself had switched out of his robes as well. Five minutes wasn’t enough time to borrow any clothes, it wasn’t even enough to explain the situation to someone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Richard knew that people would die in this battle. His ultimate hope was that Demi wouldn’t tag along.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Four and a half minutes,</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;he silently counted in his heart. However, he could already see a silhouette dashing over from afar. Demi’s silhouette.</span></p>
