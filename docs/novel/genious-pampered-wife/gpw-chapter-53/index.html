 <p><strong>Chapter 53 - Hell King’s Invitation</strong></p>
 <p>Just as Hexi left East street, she suddenly felt a shudder spread down her back, causing a tingling numbness to roam throughout her entire body.</p>
 <p>Her footsteps suddenly halted, and with an imposing expression, she stared at a point not far ahead of her, coldly shouting, “Who?”</p>
 <p>Her words were barely spoken when a man dressed all in black slowly appeared in front of her.</p>
 <p>This man looked to be about twenty five or twenty six years old. Silver string was used to tightly bind his hair, and he was wearing simple and plain clothes, yet his entire body was emitting a faintly biting cold and imposing aura.</p>
 <p>Hexi studied the man’s expression, unaware that the man’s heart was filled with bewilderment.</p>
 <p>To think that he is Qing Long, the Hell King's number one guard. As an expert in hiding, he had never before made a mistake when tracking an expert of the Gold Core stage, so he never would've expected that he could be so quickly found by an ordinary person that lacked spiritual power.</p>
 <p>“Who are you?”</p>
 <p>When he heard Hexi cautiously question again, Qing Long immediately diminished the imposing manner from his body, cupped his hands, and said, “Young Master please don’t be alarmed, this subordinate has merely come on behalf of my family's prince to invite Young Master to go to Wan Feng tea house to chat.”</p>
 <p>Hexi’s frowned slightly, her cautiousness not disappearing, instead she became colder and strictly asked, “However, I don’t know any prince, isn’t you who are mistaken?”</p>
 <p>Qing Long saw Hexi turning around to leave, and quickly moved to block her, “Young Master’s medical skill has reached perfection, how can I be mistaken? I humbly request Young Master to go to Wan Feng tea house.”</p>
 <p>Hexi’s eyes flashed with a touch of suspicion, she recalled that doctor Xie was hit on two of his vital points with energy, so at that time there was obviously someone hiding and watching them. It was likely that person is this mysterious man’s master.</p>
 <p>But, regardless of who, it was of no concern to her. Hexi slightly narrowed her eyes, and indifferently said, “Then if I don't go?”</p>
 <p>Qing Long's bright eyes turned cold with a threatening glare, his body emitting a bleak killing intention, “People invited by Master have never not come.”</p>
 <p>Hexi coldly stared at his face, and although from the bottom of her heart an intense fear that she was unable to resist surged, not the slightest trace of that fear appeared on her face. Her Invisible Needles quietly appearing in her hands instead.</p>
 <p>She, Hexi, will absolutely not accept coercion from anyone, “If your Master wants to invite me then I have to go? What is his status to make me have to obey him?”</p>
 <p>Qing Long, after listening to her, suddenly recalled the task his Master had sent him on. Once again he quickly diminished his killing intent, respectfully saying, “My Master's title is known as Hell King. In addition, Master told me tell you that he has something that Young Master wants, if Young Master goes you will not be disappointed.”</p>
 <p>Hell King?!</p>
 <p>Hexi was surprised, suddenly recalling the gossip from the group of missies’ mouths in the restaurant, about the extremely talented, handsome, unfriendly man. A legendary person at merely twenty years old, his cultivation base can already compare to those large sect masters.</p>
 <p>Thinking of the assessment that group of woman held towards this Hell King, Hexi’s eyes revealed a trace of interest.</p>
 <p>What sort of handsome appearance, demonically charming temperament, cold nature, and domineering behaviour, would attract countless beautiful women who advanced wave upon wave. All of them are defeated by his looks, while he's never interested enough to even glance at them. Oh...don’t say he can’t react towards women because he's a gay?</p>
 <p>Hexi suddenly had a little interest in meeting this legend, his Highness, the Hell King.</p>
 <p>Of course, the most important thing is that his strength and influence is so powerful, what kind of things could be in the man’s hands that would make her interested?</p>
 <p>Thinking until here, Hexi nodded towards Qing Long, and in an imposing manner coldly said, “Still not leading the way?”</p>
 <p>Qing Long staggered, almost causing him to fall. He, Qing Long, is Hell King Manor’s number one imperial bodyguard, an expert at Gold Core stage, how can he be reduced into becoming a servant by this youth that lacked spiritual power!</p>
 <p>He truly wanted to slaughter this arrogant and proud boy!</p>
