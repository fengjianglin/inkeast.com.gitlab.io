 <p><strong>Chapter 272 - Spiritual Demon Plant</strong></p>
 <p>Plants were afraid of fire so sure enough, as soon as the fireball touched the Purple Abyss Vine it instantly started burning.</p>
 <p>However, unexpectedly, even though the Purple Abyss Vine was bathed in the fire it didn’t seem frightened like it had when it was being struck by the lightning. Instead, it seemed to tremendously enjoy the fire.</p>
 <p>All of its purple vines swayed gently in the flames and at the same time, the spiritual power contained within the fire seemed to be diminishing. <em>These purple vines were actually devouring the spiritual fire??</em></p>
 <p>A moment later, all of the golden flames were completely extinguished.</p>
 <p>Hexi’s expression became grave as she prepared to withstand the Purple Abyss Vine’s next wave of attack. However, the Purple Abyss Vine once again responded beyond her expectations.</p>
 <p>They indeed moved towards Hexi, but it had no intention of attacking her. Rather, it entangled itself around Hexi’s feet and body with an action similar to fawning and acting coquettishly.</p>
 <p>Raising its sturdiest vine in front of her, it then swayed it to and fro. This pose made it seem like it was asking for something.</p>
 <p>For a moment Hexi was dumbstruck.<em> Could it be that this purple vine was an M? Did it enjoy being attacked and wanted more?</em></p>
 <p>During this time, Nangong Yu standing behind her stepped forward and taking out a porcelain bottle filled with Ninth Secluded Spring Water, he poured two drops onto the purple vine swaying in front of Hexi.</p>
 <p>In the next instant, the scene unfolding before Hexi caused her further shock.</p>
 <p>The leaves of the Purple Abyss Vine suddenly started emitting the hint of a violet light and during this, they all stood straight up and swayed in sync.</p>
 <p>Hexi could’ve sworn that if there was music, the purple vines would’ve been dancing around in a lively manner.</p>
 <p>After moving about for a while in a synchronised dance, the violet light faded without a trace and the sturdier vines once again eagerly wrapped themselves around Hexi; this time including Nangong Yu in its fawning. Then, almost as if it was impatiently begging, it rubbed its leaves together to make a rustling sound.</p>
 <p>Hexi still hadn’t completely come to terms with what had just happened when she heard Nangong Yu slowly speaking as he narrowed his eyes, “You want this?”</p>
 <p>As he shook the porcelain bottle in front of the purple vines, it immediately started swaying in exuberance. If it hadn’t been afraid that Nangong Yu would attack it with lightning like before, it would’ve already snatched the bottle away.</p>
 <p>Hexi, however, was stunned. “It can understand what we’re saying?”</p>
 <p>Nangong Yu answered, “There aren’t that many fifth rank spiritual plants capable of using Divine Sense, but the Purple Abyss Vine is one of them and is therefore known as a spiritual demon plant. Spiritual demon plants can generally communicate with people like spirit pets.”</p>
 <p>After saying that, Nangong Yu looked at Hexi with affection in his eyes. “Xi’er, you have a muddled dantian and possess the spiritual power of all five elements, so advancing the spiritual root of your wood attribute is immensely important for you. Although the rank of this Purple Abyss Vine isn’t particularly high, it’s still useful. Moreover, it’s possible for it to advance in the future so you should take it as your spirit pet.”</p>
 <p>Hearing that, Hexi’s heart was moved.</p>
 <p>You could say that possessing the spiritual power of all five elements would make Hexi exceptionally powerful, but at the same time, the road of ascension was also tremendously more difficult when compared to other martial artists.</p>
 <p>Since she was still a low-level martial artist it wasn’t too bad though as she could only accumulate a certain amount of spiritual power.</p>
 <p>But if she wanted to advance to Gold Core stage in the future, she would inevitably need to make a breakthrough on the spiritual power of all five elements. This would help to balance her spiritual power and raise her chances of succeeding.</p>
 <p>It wasn’t too difficult for her to advance the dual attributes of fire and water, but for several other elements, she had yet to find a method to help advance them. So in regards to this, it would definitely be useful for her to take a wood attribute spirit pet.</p>
 <p>But while many people took in all sorts of spirit pets, most of them were beast pets. How many of them were able to subdue plant spirit pets?</p>
 <p>Would the Purple Abyss Vine really want to be her spirit pet?</p>
