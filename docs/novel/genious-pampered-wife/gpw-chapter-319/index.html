 <p><strong>Chapter 319 - Too Shameless</strong></p>
 <p>Being ridiculed by these people didn’t make Wu Yu angry at all, and he instead chuckled, “As expected, my good intentions were ignored! Didn’t any of you discover that it’s only you guys who touched those sick people? If saving them was really that worthwhile, then why didn’t even one person from the Liu Li sect move to help? I hope you don’t regret your actions later!”</p>
 <p>Feng Lian Ying was filled with hatred when she heard that, but she didn’t look at Wu Yu, instead choosing to look at Hexi standing nearby.</p>
 <p>“Young Master Xi, it seems like you’re slyly trying to create discord in the relationship between everyone and the Liu Li sect. What are your intentions; you don’t want everyone to be saved? Or do you want to wait until everyone is dead so you can gain an advantage?”</p>
 <p>“Although I knew you were vicious, I didn’t expect you to be so vicious in such a situation!”</p>
 <p>When Feng Lian Ying spat out these words, everyone’s angry eyes turned to glare at Hexi.</p>
 <p>Hexi just leisurely smiled; she had absolutely no intention to respond.</p>
 <p>Wu Yu, however, sneeringly said, “Obviously it was me who spoke, but why did Ice Lotus Fairy accuse someone else? Rather than glare at me, why don’t you take a look at what’s happened to the people behind you?”</p>
 <p>As Wu Yu finished speaking, they all heard a few bangs from behind them.</p>
 <p>Several people had fainted to the ground! Their faces were flushed, and their bodies were burning hot. Some people even had red rashes on their faces.</p>
 <p>“How...how is this possible?!!” The martial artists exclaimed in alarm. “These people obviously hadn’t entered the medicinal field!”</p>
 <p>“I-it’s the pus! The pus on them is contagious!”</p>
 <p>“Everybody run, quickly--!!”</p>
 <p>For a moment, everyone’s faces were covered in fear and shock before they all ran away from those who were already sick.</p>
 <p>The previously ordered scene had once again become chaotic, and there was no one taking care of those who were sick.</p>
 <p>With their own little lives at risk, what noble character and gaining pleasure from helping others?! That was all empty talk!</p>
 <p>In just a moment, the entire scene was filled with chaos, and the medicinal field was a cacophony of terror.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Feng Lian Ying raised her voice, and indignantly asked, “Young Master Xi, since you knew that this disease was contagious, why didn’t you say something earlier? That would’ve prevented more people from being infected, right?!”</p>
 <p>Hexi looked at her with a smile that wasn’t a smile. “I thought you knew that. After all, aren’t you a fifth rank doctor? How could I dare to meddle in your affairs and tell you what to do?”</p>
 <p>Feng Lian Ying clenched her teeth, hatred gleaming in her eyes. “Human life is immeasurable. How could what happened before cause you to have a grudge against me, and neglect so many people’s lives?”</p>
 <p>“I was busy thinking about how to treat everyone’s ailments. Naturally, I couldn’t worry about so much at one time. But, Young Master Xi, you obviously knew yet you didn’t say it; for what purpose? Are the lives of these hundred odd people less important to you than your personal grudge?”</p>
 <p>After Feng Lian Ying spoke, everyone suddenly looked at Hexi with gazes full of contempt and resentment.</p>
 <p>Especially those people whose friends and relatives had fallen unconscious. They didn’t even know if they themselves were infected or not, so they felt even more hatred towards Hexi. They had all drawn out their Long Swords as they itched to rush forwards and kill her.</p>
 <p>Wu Yu was simply amazed at Feng Lian Ying’s ability to deliberately distort the truth.</p>
 <p>Previously, he was unaware of why Gu Liufeng and his Princess hated Feng Lian Ying so much. After all, he’d only met Feng Lian Ying a few times, yet, he also knew that she liked his own Master.</p>
 <p>But now, he’d seen the reason!</p>
 <p>She was a treacherous and vicious woman! She was simply too shameless!</p>
