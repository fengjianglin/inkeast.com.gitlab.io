 <p><strong>Chapter 251 - Hiding One's Ability By Keeping Quiet?</strong></p>
 <p>The corners of Gu Liufeng’s eyes twitched as he continued, “What I mean is, Ice Lotus Fairy, is that since you injured one of my people, let me return the favour to Fairy in the same way you injured him. That way, the grudge between us can be considered as settled!”</p>
 <p>“You!! Gu Liufeng, you’re clearly unable to differentiate between good and bad!” Feng Lian Ying’s entire body was shaking from anger. “If you were tactful you would scram, and if you don’t, don’t blame me for being impolite! Your cultivation base is rather equal with mine, but since I now have the assistance of a medicinal pill, my power far surpasses yours. Do you really think I’m afraid of you?!”</p>
 <p>Gu Liufeng laughed lazily, his eyes gleaming brightly. “Or, Ice Lotus Fairy could choose to make amends by apologising to my subordinate!”</p>
 <p>“You’re looking for death!” Feng Lian Ying furiously screamed, her whole body like a shadow sword as it shot over towards Gu Liufeng.</p>
 <p>Currently, what she hated the most was hearing others ordering her to kneel down and apologise. Xi Yue, that bastard, had humiliated her! In this lifetime she would never forget this!</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye two figures; one red and one white, were locked together in battle.</p>
 <p>The two people’s movements were extremely fast as they flew about in the air of the secret territory. They were constantly using formidable spiritual pressure wantonly, causing bright lights to bloom in the sky.</p>
 <p>Zhou Yan’an watched on in a daze for a while. He felt a tightness in his chest, and although he was also a Gold Core stage martial artist, his current level wasn’t enough for him to be a match in such a battle.</p>
 <p>Hexi watched on with an extremely serious expression, strangely able to follow the movements of the two people in the air.</p>
 <p>To her surprise, at this time the two seemed to be evenly matched in their fight, but she felt that Gu Liufeng’s strength seemed to be far more than what he was exhibiting. Was he...hiding it?</p>
 <p>Hexi frowned and seemed to be in trance, yet suddenly her eyes came into contact with a pair of eyes that seemed to be smiling yet not smiling.</p>
 <p>This pair of eyes resembled peach blossom petals. It was like they gleamed with the reflection of bright multicoloured sunlight, but in a flash, these lights disappeared without a trace.</p>
 <p><em>Gu Liufeng!</em></p>
 <p>In such an intense moment of fighting, he was actually still able to be distracted enough to look at her. Moreover, those eyes contained a smiling expression that was deep and yet tranquil, as if they could see through her mind.</p>
 <p>Hexi suddenly lowered her head, a touch of contemplation sweeping across her eyes.</p>
 <p>Zhou Yan’an noticed Hexi bowing his head. With the side of his face delicate and pale, his whole aura was that of a frail yet beautiful porcelain doll that could shatter at any time.</p>
 <p>He couldn’t help but comforted him with, “Young Master Xi, you don’t have to worry, as long as my Young Master is here nothing will happen to us. Although he’s only at Gold Core stage, he’s entirely different compared to such a useless person like me. I’ve also never seen a martial artist on the same level beat him.”</p>
 <p>Hexi raised an eyebrow without answering, instead suddenly asking him, “Shopkeeper Zhou, we only met by chance and I have no affection towards you, so why did you want to risk your life to save me?”</p>
 <p>From the beginning Hexi couldn’t figure out this point; she could understand why Dandan and the little Golden Dragon would save her, but Zhou Yan’an and her were only strangers by chance. Helping her might be normal, but risking his life to save her was really too strange.</p>
 <p>Zhou Yan’an’s face showed a trace of shame and indecision as he stayed silent for a long while, before replying, “To be honest, this humble one initially came to Zijin Palace to get the Inheritance, but it wasn’t for the Maha Inheritance! Rather, it was to get a pill prescription from Zijin’s Master.”</p>
 <p>Hexi’s face showed her surprise.</p>
 <p>She had already received Zijin Palace’s Inheritance, hence she naturally knew that there wasn’t any pill prescriptions included in the Inheritance of Zijin’s Master. At most he only left her an extraordinary pill furnace in Zijin Palace.</p>
