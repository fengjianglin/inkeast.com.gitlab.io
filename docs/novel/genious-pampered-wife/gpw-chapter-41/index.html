 <p>Hexi sneered, taking the remaining yuan she placed them in her storage ring. Probably less than three million yuan remained, as just within these last two days, Zhang Dezhong had actually managed lose about two million yuan.</p>
 <p>Because his mind was hypnotised, Zhang Dezhong was still kneeling expressionlessly on the ground like a foolish person, even saliva flowed out from his mouth. Due to the extreme fear, the stench of his faeces was overwhelming, making him look even more miserable than a beggar.</p>
 <p>Hexi’s eyes that were looking at him didn't show disgust, rather it was a coldness, just like a sharp blade dipped in poison, they flickered with a clouded purple light.</p>
 <p>She lightly placed her palm on Zhang Dezhong’s back, releasing a burst of internal energy, the Invisible Needles that currently resided in his brain shot out and flew back into her hands.</p>
 <p>Almost at the same time, her hand that was holding a dagger, with an unparalleled speed, cut across the meridians on Zhang Dezhong’s body and throat one by one.</p>
 <p>In a split second, blood wildly sprayed, his howls as if shaking heaven.</p>
 <p>That’s right, Zhang Dezhong had returned to his senses, his face shocked as he looked at Hexi. There wasn't a trace of resentment in his eyes, only desperate begging.</p>
 <p>Hexi, still holding the bloody dagger, raised it in front of his eyes and lightly touched the beads of blood on it, then indifferently laughed, “Butler Zhang, aren't you interested in selling people as slaves? Today, I'll let you personally taste it.”</p>
 <p><em>“Ah---! Ah---!”</em> Butler Zhang wanted to beg, however, he found that he simply couldn't make any sound. Even more, his muscles and veins had been cut, making him completely unable to move.</p>
 <p>Hexi's smile became more brilliant, so even though her face was now paled with disguise, it still looked bright and beautiful. “Are you afraid, looking at all of this blood? Don’t worry, you're a martial artist, your body can gain nourishment from spiritual power, this small injury is simply not fatal to you. However, I've already cut off all the meridians in your body, in this lifetime, don’t ever think you'll be able to move or speak again.”</p>
 <p>Butler Zhang’s eyes, that looked like dead fish eyes, bulged out due to fear and desperation. They started twitching, filled with begging as if to say: Please just kill me! Just kill me!</p>
 <p>“Butler Zhang, don’t worry, at that time you didn't kill me, so how could I be willing to kill you! Are you worried that since you've become crippled, you can’t be sold to the pig market? Hehe, how can that be possible?”</p>
 <p>Hexi took two steps forward as she laughed, looking down at him, every word she spit out sending him further into despair, “In the pig market, many people want to use a martial artist’s body to make all kinds of experiments. There are also people who want to keep ‘pig meat’, like yourself, to become a carrier, a body used to remove the impurities and poisons in crystal stones and spiritual plants. Butler Zhang, in the future you'll only need to lie down on the bed and there will be people to serve you, shouldn’t you thank me for finding such a good place for you to return to?”</p>
 <p>Because spiritual energy in the air was thin, martial artists needed to use crystal stones and spiritual plants to promote their cultivation base. However, most crystal stones and spiritual plants contained impurities and poison, so therefore they had limited uses. While they absorbed the spiritual energy, they had to get rid of the impurities, and like this it more or less affected the martial artist’s body, slowing down the speed of their cultivation.</p>
 <p>Therefore, some rich people had come up with the idea of ‘pig meat’, making ‘pig meat’ absorb the spiritual energy found in a crystal stone, and taking in the poison from a spiritual plant. Then the owner will absorb the spiritual energy from the body of the ‘pig meat’, this way they won't have any trouble with poison and also have an accelerated cultivation speed.</p>
 <p>As for those 'pig meat' slaves that accumulated a large amount of impurities and poison in their bodies, their owners wouldn't care about their misery or suffering.</p>
 <p>Zhang Dezhong issued <em>‘ka ka’</em> sound, only despair remained in his muddy and bloodshot eyes.</p>
 <p>What he didn’t expect, was that with only a moment of greed, he would actually fall to such an end! If only he had known earlier...if he had known earlier...</p>
