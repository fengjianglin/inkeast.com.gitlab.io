 <p><strong>Chapter 215 - Golden Bodhi Tree</strong></p>
 <p>He had barely finished speaking, when his eyes suddenly lit up, and he ran towards the forest. He was going so fast, that Hexi had to use all her strength just to keep up.</p>
 <p>Dandan ran for a quarter of an hour before abruptly stopping, allowing Hexi to heave a sigh of relief. Yet just when she was about to tell him not to go running off again, she noticed something in front of her and her expression suddenly changed.</p>
 <p>Less than five metres away from Dandan and herself, there was a Golden Python curled up motionlessly.</p>
 <p>Golden Python! The Golden Python was a sixth ranked magical beast. Amongst the existence of magical beasts, it belonged to a powerful class; its strength equal to that of a Nascent Soul stage martial artist. A magical beast of such rank, how could it appear here?</p>
 <p>Hexi sucked in a cold breath, and slowly turned around to retreat.</p>
 <p><em>What a joke! With her current level being Gold Core stage, she would barely be able to hit him. Against a Nascent Soul stage Golden Python, she would instantly lose!</em></p>
 <p>However, just as Hexi was about to run away, she noticed that Dandan had returned to his original appearance, and with his small and short legs, he ran straight towards the Golden Python.</p>
 <p>Hexi’s eyes widened in shock, and she stared blankly as she watched her small and foolish pet clinging to the giant snake’s body. Releasing a hiss, the Golden Python started rolling its body and continuously turning over.</p>
 <p><em>What the f*ck! Is that even possible?!</em></p>
 <p>Hexi watched as Dandan climbed passed the Golden Python’s spiralling body, and ran towards the base of a tree. Holding onto the thick and solid trunk, he started to climb up it.</p>
 <p>Hexi followed Dandan’s movements with her gaze, and was once again shocked.</p>
 <p>It unexpectedly turned out to be a Golden Bodhi Tree?! Compared to the Yuan Yang Fruit, this tree’s high level spiritual fruit simply couldn’t be found anywhere on Mi Luo Continent!</p>
 <p>Even the All Living Things Record said that the Bodhi Tree only bloomed once every thousand years, and that it took ten thousand years to bear any fruit. For a Bodhi Tree to become a Golden Bodhi Tree, it had to have bloomed and borne fruit at least ten times, causing its worth to be beyond measure.</p>
 <p>A single Bodhi Fruit didn’t only enhance a martial artist’s cultivation speed, but was able to strengthen a martial artist’s dantian and meridians, while it also helped to purify their spiritual power. As for the effects of a Golden Bodhi Fruit, it could be said that the advantages were in defiance of the natural order of things.</p>
 <p>Hexi’s heart leapt. <em>If she were to plant the Golden Bodhi Tree in her space; then wouldn’t she be able to get rich?</em></p>
 <p>However at this time, Dandan had rapidly been climbing up the Golden Bodhi Tree, plucking the Golden Bodhi Fruit, and then stuffing each and every one into his mouth. He also stuffed the last fruit into his mouth even though it had yet to ripen.</p>
 <p>A corner of Hexi’s mouth twitched. <em>This little good for nothing glutton, how could he eat this much again?! Her Golden Bodhi Tree and dreams of getting rich were just completely destroyed by him!</em></p>
 <p>Hexi no longer hesitated. With power fluctuating from her body as she used her Qing Gong and not her spiritual power, she lightly land at the base of the Golden Bodhi Tree. Then, using her hand, she gently knocked on the roots of the tree.</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, the Golden Bodhi Tree disappeared and Dandan fell from mid-air, his stomach distended from eating so much. As he landed on the ground with a thump, he looked up at Hexi with a foolish yet adorable expression.</p>
 <p>Hexi pointed at his small head and just as she was about to scold him, her expression suddenly changed. Grabbing Dandan and throwing him into her space, she then leapt to the side, narrowly avoiding a fatal blow from the Golden Python.</p>
 <p>The Golden Python released a furious snarl, its big blood-red eyes staring menacingly at Hexi. And as the venom dripping down its fangs landed on the ground, a sizzling noise could be heard as the ground corroded.</p>
 <p>Why would Hexi dare to stay? Condensing the spiritual power within her body to her feet, she then rapidly ran away as fast as lightning.</p>
 <p>But no matter how fast her speed, the Golden Python was even faster. Obviously its body was gigantic, yet it could somehow still move freely amongst the forest.</p>
 <p>With a fishy stench, black venom unceasingly hurtled towards Hexi. And wherever the venom landed, not even a single blade of grass was spared.</p>
