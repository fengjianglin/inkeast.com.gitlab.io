 <p><strong>Chapter 92 - Very Delicious</strong></p>
 <p>At this time, Xiao Li walked in while carrying a wash basin that appeared like it was more than half her size.</p>
 <p>Hexi quickly grabbed the basin, and removing a package of pastries from her space, she passed it to Xiao Li, only saying, “Eat it.”</p>
 <p>These days, Hexi had often been making food in her space. With the large supply of food ingredients and seasonings available to her, she was able to make many different kinds of foods.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, due to the existence of Dan Dan, that big stomach, no matter how much food she made, it was all devoured.</p>
 <p>Being able to bring food out from her space was very rare, and she had only managed it this time as she had done it secretly, withdrawing this package of pastries while Dan Dan was distracted.</p>
 <p>Xiao Li was flattered as she looked at Hexi, yet she was unsure of what to do with the pastries she held in her hands, “Miss, such a good dessert must be expensive right? You really...really want to give these to me to eat?”</p>
 <p>Even though the package containing the pastries was unopened, Xiao Li could smell their rich fragrance and sense a refreshing spiritual energy inside.</p>
 <p>Such a high quality dessert like this would be sold in the Intoxicated Immortal restaurant. Even if Xiao Li worked for a lifetime, she still wouldn't be able to afford it, right?</p>
 <p>Hexi frowned, “If I let you eat it then just eat it, why so much nonsense?”</p>
 <p>Seeing that Xiao Li still looked fearful, her small face full of longing as she strongly endured her hunger, Hexi couldn’t help but shake her head, “I made these myself. In the future, no matter how many you want to eat, I'll be able to give them to you...since you follow me, as long as you're well behaved and obedient, I naturally guarantee that you won't have to worry about your clothes and food.”</p>
 <p><em>“Ah--!”</em> Xiao Li's mouth opened in surprise as she stared at Hexi with eyes full of reverence, “Miss, you...you're a doctor with brilliant medical skills, yet you're actually able to cook spiritual food too! You're simply too awesome! That Xiao Li and Brother are able to follow you, we're really blessed!”</p>
 <p>After saying this, Xiao Li carefully opened the wrapping and reverently picked up a delicately shaped peach blossom cake, slowly placing it in her mouth. The peach blossom’s fragrance mixed with the sweetness of the pastry as it melted in her mouth, while the rich spiritual energy that touched her tongue was absorbed into her body, leaving her with a feeling of relaxation.</p>
 <p>Xiao Li's eyes opened wide as she stared blankly with shock. As she chewed the pastry in her mouth with all her might, it was almost like she was itching to swallow her own tongue to savour every crumb.</p>
 <p>So delicious...it was really delicious! In this lifetime, she had never eaten such delicious food before! Even when her Brother had once secretly brought her to their employer's house to eat expensive spiritual fruit, that fruit hadn't had one tenth of the deliciousness contained in this cake.</p>
 <p>As soon as she returned to her senses, she realised that only two red bean cakes remained in the bag that she held in her hands, yet she still wanted to continue eating.</p>
 <p>Xiao Li's face flushed with shame, her voice filled with panic and anxiousness as she spoke, “Miss, I...I didn’t mean to eat so many, but they were really delicious...you, you should punish me!!”</p>
 <p>“Calm down, it’s only a few pieces of pastry.” When Hexi saw the little girl's regretful crying expression, it touched her heart, causing the corner of her mouth to subconsciously rise, “You stuffed your stomach with all those cakes, but there'll be more delicious foods later and it'll be your loss as you'll be too full to eat more.”</p>
 <p>At this time, Hexi remembered that she couldn't always spend all her time cooking in her space.</p>
 <p>It wasn't just Dan Dan, the big stomach king who devoured everything she made to look after, there was also Wet Nurse Chen. Her body was so weak, and having been nursed back to health after not being able to treat the illness for so long, it now appeared, that rather than medicine to help her recuperate, it would be better to use healthy food.</p>
 <p>Of course, if Hexi could take advantage of this situation to teach Wet Nurse Chen how to cook, in the future everyone's meals would improve, while allowing for her to be lazy and cook less.</p>
 <p>In regards to Wet Nurse Chen's recovery, just as Hexi expected, the healthy food was very beneficial. After eating it for more than a week, Wet Nurse Chen's originally weak and unsightly complexion became rosy, while the impurities in her meridians also started to clear up.</p>
