 <p><strong>Chapter 48 - If It’s Cured?</strong></p>
 <p>But, after that?</p>
 <p>After that she lost her only brother forever.</p>
 <p>Looking at little girl's desperate crying face, Hexi suddenly made up her mind, she really didn't want for her to have an ending like her brother's.</p>
 <p>Everyone in the surrounding crowd, including shopkeeper Zhou, stared at Hexi with suspicion and doubt. However, how could Hexi care about their stares.</p>
 <p>She squatted down and grasped the youth’s hand while three of her fingers pressed down on his wrist, quietly feeling the throb of his pulse.</p>
 <p>The reddish gold colour of the setting sun graced the youth’s slender and fair hand, highlighting his well proportioned fingers like a piece of well carved art, but nobody could understand what this youth was doing.</p>
 <p>Could it be that to diagnose the state of an illness, he didn't have to use spiritual power to explore the person's body to sense the movement of their spiritual energy and circumstances? But there wasn't a trace of spiritual power being emitted from this youth’s body, how could he cure people?</p>
 <p>He must be wanting to show off to please people, right?</p>
 <p>Everyone’s gaze was full of loathing as they looked towards Hexi, even a trace of cold disdain flashed in doctor Xie’s eyes.</p>
 <p>This kid hasn't even finished growing his hair[1], yet he dared to disregard my words, he was simply asking for death!</p>
 <p>Hexi continued taking the boy's pulse for as long as it took an incense stick to burn. Everyone was starting to get impatient when she finally released the youth's hand, and faintly said to the little girl, “Rest assured, I can treat your brother’s illness.”</p>
 <p>The little girl became dumbfounded upon hearing this, her lips trembling, she was speechless for quite a while.</p>
 <p>But how could everyone believe her words, as one after another they ridiculed her, saying she had no sense of shame, a big talker.</p>
 <p>Even shopkeeper Qin that was behind doctor Xie burst into loud laughter, shouting with his sharp voice, “Where did this cocky and arrogant kid come from, his hair hasn't even finished growing but he already dares to say such lies here! Did you not hear our doctor Xie say that he was unable to do anything about his illness? What do you regard us as, is your rank higher than doctor Xie's?”</p>
 <p>Hexi completely ignored everyone who was ridiculing and verbally abusing her, indifferently saying, “I don’t have a rank.”</p>
 <p>When everyone heard what was said they roared with laughter, while other's reprimanded her for talking about a sick person's life as if it was a joke.</p>
 <p>Although shopkeeper Zhou’s words and attitude was not bad like the others, he couldn’t help but try to give advice, “This little Young Master, a doctor's concern towards human life really isn’t simple, they absolutely cannot let emotion affect one’s decisions or they will end up treating a sick person recklessly. Besides, this meridian fracture illness, since ancient times no one has ever been able to cure it, so you had better quickly go back home!”</p>
 <p>Hexi raised her head to look into his eyes, her face showed a somewhat respectful expression as she slowly spoke, “I naturally know that a doctor's concern towards human life isn't simple, therefore, I never talk big in this regard.”</p>
 <p>Heard what was said, doctor Xie coldly sneered, his face full of ridicule, “Inevitably, in this world there’s always someone who overestimates one’s capabilities, they dare to brag about anything in order to seek fame. Since you said you're able to treat him, then we won't stop you. But if your treatment is no good, if you don't have even the simplest of abilities, then I'll certainly have no choice but to report you to the doctor's association to judge you guilty as a fake doctor.”</p>
 <p>In this Mi Luo continent, the position and payment of a high rank doctor is extremely high. On top of that, even the lowest first rank doctor will hardly be seen in many remote places, leading to people pretending to be a doctor to show off and swindle others.</p>
 <p>Therefore, in order to put an end to this phenomenon, every country made impersonating a doctor a heavy crime. The law punished the most serious criminals by cutting off all their fingers, abolishing their cultivation base, and forcing them to become a labourer in crystal mine for the rest of their lifetime.</p>
 <p>However, the expression on Hexi’s face didn't change a bit, and upon hearing what was said she coldly gazed at doctor Xie, “Oh? Then if I can cure him?”</p>
