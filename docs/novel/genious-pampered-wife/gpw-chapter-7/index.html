 <p><strong>Chapter 7 – Slave Ownership Card And Slave Imprint</strong></p>
 <p>The Invisible Needles in her hand flew as if struck by lightning, accurately and quietly piercing into the four guards’ Sea of Qi acupuncture point.</p>
 <p>The flying swords in the hands of the four guards’ suddenly halted in mid air, followed by a <em>‘bang’</em>, the swords fell to the ground.</p>
 <p>The four guards’ faces filled with shock and disbelief, as they stared blankly at the faintly sneering little girl on the stage.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, one of them screamed, “Why can’t I use my spiritual power?!”</p>
 <p>“Evil woman, what did you do to us!!”</p>
 <p>Hexi laughed lightly as she leaped into the air, raising her foot she ruthlessly kicked the four guards who had lost their spiritual power.</p>
 <p>Under the bright lights directed onto the stage, the slender and petite little girl mockingly looked at everyone surrounding her as she towered over them.</p>
 <p>Around her were the Foundation Establishment stage cultivators, that were all howling and groaning. Furthermore, there was also Zhu Zhongba, that had been so scared of her, he had tumbled to the ground to land hard on his buttocks.</p>
 <p>This scene was simply too shocking and weird, obviously this thin and weak little girl seemed like a Queen inspecting her territory. It caused a person’s heart to tremble in fear, but also long to worship her.</p>
 <p>Zhu Zhongba’s frightened face looked at the little girl standing not too far from where he had fallen. Originally, he had gotten up after first being knocked down by her, but after his guards had been defeated by a little girl, he had collapsed to the ground in shock.</p>
 <p>He saw Hexi start to walk towards him and screamed repeatedly, rushing over to hold Wu Yu’s hand he yelled, “Save me……save me! That slut in your Gluttonous House has caused me such trouble, yet you don’t care? I’m your guest!!”</p>
 <p>“As long as you help me to subdue her, however much yuan you want, I’ll give it all to you!!”</p>
 <p>Wu Yu remained calm and collected while he separated their hands, his eyes overflowing with interest as he looked at He Xi, “Young Master Zhu, I already said earlier, once the product is sold, Gluttonous House will not have any responsibility.”</p>
 <p>“From the moment…I handed over the slave ownership card to you, this product no longer had anything to do with Gluttonous House.”</p>
 <p>Wuyu’s words make Zhu Zhongba’s mind go blank for a minute, then suddenly his face filled with an ecstatic light.</p>
 <p>He activated his spiritual power, condensing it into a small point to frantically pour it into the Slave Ownership Card, while nervously murmuring.</p>
 <p>“Loathsome lady, you are dead! You dare to attack me, this time you’re dead for sure!”</p>
 <p>The moment Zhu Zhongba had started to pour his spiritual power into the slave ownership card, Hexi had felt a burst of pain in her head, like being pricked with needles.</p>
 <p>This feeling of pain was very familiar. When she was at the entrance of the examination room, it had being due to feeling this pain that she had lost consciousness.</p>
 <p>Damn it—-! So this is what the slave ownership card was used for! It’s a form of slave control that had been imprinted in her body!</p>
 <p>Hexi’s eyes turned cold, exposing her anger. With lightning speed she started running away to find a way out.</p>
 <p>She want to leave, leave this place right away!</p>
 <p>Even if she had to die she, Hexi, absolutely refused to become a slave. Becoming docile and obedient to please others was an insult to her!</p>
 <p>But she hadn’t even managed to run five meters away when the pain in her head suddenly intensified.</p>
 <p>No longer able to withstand the pain in her head, Hexi felt her body fall towards the ground, once again powerless to stop from losing consciousness.</p>
 <p>Zhu Zhongba held the Slave Ownership Card tightly in his fist, as he very carefully walked towards He Xi, intending to confirm if she really was unconscious. When there was no response from Hexi, he let out an insolent laugh.</p>
 <p>“Loathsome lady, let’s see how you can still be cocky!” His foot fiercely kicked Hexi’s body.</p>
 <p>“Dared to attack I, this young master, you simply don’t want to live! I will let you know that if you dare to disobey me, your future will be miserable!”</p>
 <p>At this time, those knocked down guards finally managed stand.</p>
 <p>Their sealed Dantians had now been restored, it was no longer a situation where they were unable to use their spiritual power.</p>
 <p>Their faces revealed relieved expressions, but when they looked at the unconscious Hexi on the ground, their eyes flashed with fear and bitter resentment.</p>
 <p>Zhu Zhongba, with a face full of pride, waved a hand towards Hexi, “You couldn’t even deal with this loathsome lady, still needing I, this young master, to take care of her.”</p>
 <p>“Shut her in the cage and carry it to go back. If there are any mistakes see how I will deal with you!”</p>
 <p>While repeatedly answering yes, the guards’ roughly carried the unconscious Hexi and threw her into the cage, like an animal bought at the marketplace. Swaying with the weight of the cage they carried, they left the stage.</p>
