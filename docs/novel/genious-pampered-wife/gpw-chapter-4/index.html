 <p><strong>Chapter 4 – An Auction Product Naturally Should Be Sold Off</strong></p>
 <p>Nalan Hexi was repeatedly hit by someone until she passed out, and was sold to Gluttonous House. Before losing consciousness, she vaguely heard a vicious voice, “Don’t blame me, if want to blame someone, then just blame yourself for being trash. You even dared to block the Second Miss’ path.”</p>
 <p>Nalan Hexi’s appearance was quite ordinary and she was the good for nothing Miss who couldn’t cultivate. Her only worth was to be bought by Gluttonous House and sold as a low grade furnace. Before the auction, she was humiliated by some vulgar and low rank martial artists, and in the end she was unable to endure it and killed herself in the cage.</p>
 <p>When her eyes next opened, the soul that occupied this weak body was no longer Nalan Hexi, rather, it’s the assassin that has come back from hell – He Xi.</p>
 <p>He Xi looked at the corpses on the ground, her eyes hiding any trace of emotion.</p>
 <p>Any slags who dared to provoke her would be damned. She would not show any mercy.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, she lifted her head and gazed towards the back of the room. The corner of her mouth hooked into a cold smile.</p>
 <p>She immediately turned around and walked towards the entrance.</p>
 <p>However, after only taking two steps, her expression suddenly changed. Her beautiful phoenix eyes emitted a cold and blade-like aura.</p>
 <p>Damn it—-! Someone’s been watching me all along—-!!</p>
 <p>He Xi’s mind was just flashing this thought, when a <em>‘tumph’</em> sound could be heard, and she fainted to the ground.</p>
 <p>****</p>
 <p>Dim light shined onto the room’s entrance. Two tall figures slowly walked towards the unconscious Hexi.</p>
 <p>One of them looked at the room that was filled with corpses and could’t help but be speechless, “Who could have thought that such an unremarkable little girl, could unexpectedly be so ruthless. Not even one person was spared.”</p>
 <p>The other person’s face was hidden in the shadows, making it impossible to clearly define the appearance. The whole body emitted an imposing aura, warning people to be terrified.</p>
 <p>He looked down, seemingly as if engrossed with watching the unconscious little girl on the ground. His eyes showed a ruthless interest while looking at her, as if she were a rare prey.</p>
 <p>“But when this girl was killing people, I didn’t feel any spiritual fluctuation. I don’t know what kind of secret method she used. Master, what should we do with her?”</p>
 <p>The man’s head slowly lifted as he raised his eyes to look at the other person, indifferently he replied, “Wu Yu, she is an auction product belonging to Gluttonous House. Since she is an auction product, naturally she should be sold off. You still require me to teach you this point?”</p>
 <p>Wu Yu’s heart trembled in fear and he quickly bowed, “Wu Yu understands. I will strengthen the slave control placed on her and put chains directly around her body, so she has no way to escape. I believe that such an exceptionally good furnace will certainly be able to fetch a good price.”</p>
 <p>The man who was being called ‘Master’ slightly hooked up the corner of his mouth, his eyes filled with an overflowing curiosity “I’m looking forward to it.”</p>
 <p>Finished speaking, he faintly swept a glance towards the little girl on the ground, then rapidly left.</p>
 <p>****</p>
 <p>At this moment it was already midnight, the city gate had been closed, not a sound could be heard, only Gluttonous House was still brightly lit up.</p>
 <p>“The next item is the finale for this auction.”</p>
 <p>The host, who was wearing magnificent gold coloured clothes, clapped his hands. Soon, a huge golden cage dropped down from the sky. At the same time, a brilliant golden light pointed towards the middle of the stage, landing on the cage.</p>
 <p>Suddenly the auction was enveloped in chaos. As it turns out, what was placed in the cage was not goods, rather, it was a living person.</p>
 <p>It could be seen that the person was a little girl, no more than seventeen years old. Pale skin, thin figure, and completely lacking in attractiveness.</p>
 <p>At this time, her eyes were tightly closed, her thin hands and feet were bound together with an iron chain. A heavy silver lock secured the chains, while she lay motionless in the middle of the cage.</p>
 <p>After the little girl in the cage was clearly seen, everyone present started arguing.</p>
 <p>“We’re participating in the auction for a premium product! We each paid one thousand yuan to Gluttonous House for a ticket, how could you sell us such inferior goods?”</p>
