 <p><strong>Chapter 313 - Intuition</strong></p>
 <p>Gu Liufeng moved closer to Hexi, and smiled lazily as he said, “Little Yue’er, you’d long ago seen the problem with these spiritual herbs?”</p>
 <p>Hexi’s expression was indifferent as she slowly nodded.</p>
 <p>However, all the bodyguards from Hell King Manor suddenly returned to their senses, and despite the fear they were all feeling, they were looking at Hexi with expressions full of gratefulness.</p>
 <p>Just now, if it weren’t for their Princess stopping them, they could very well have ended up with a horrific appearance too!</p>
 <p>It was no wonder that Master doted so much on Princess and was so trusting in regards to her medical skill! There were so many high level martial artists here, and even a fifth rank doctor; but Princess was the only person who saw through the strangeness of this medicinal field.</p>
 <p>“How did you know that there was a problem with the spiritual herbs?” A cold voice suddenly asked, interrupting everyone’s arguing.</p>
 <p>It was unknown when Feng Yunjing had moved to Hexi’s side, but he was now leaning his head towards her with his eyes burning as he waited for her answer.</p>
 <p>Hexi glanced at him before indifferently answering, “Intuition.”</p>
 <p>This perfunctory answer caused Feng Yunjing’s face to frown in anger.</p>
 <p>He hadn’t expected that even though he’d discarded his honour to ask, Hexi would dare not to give him any face.</p>
 <p>But, in fact, Hexi didn’t actually lie.</p>
 <p>When it came to the spiritual herbs within this medicinal field, whether it was colour, shape, scent, or spiritual power fluctuations; they all were exactly the same as real herbs.</p>
 <p>She couldn’t accurately pinpoint what was wrong with the herbs, but her doctor’s natural instinct made her feel naturally sensitive towards poisonous substances.</p>
 <p>This was also coupled with Dandan’s warning from her space in the beginning. “Mother, there are dangerous things here; be careful!”</p>
 <p>Therefore, she could be sure that there must be a problem with this medicinal field.</p>
 <p>The Liu Li sect’s disciples who’d followed behind Feng Yunjing couldn’t bear to see their Young Master being ignored in such a way, and couldn’t help but scorn, “So as it turns out it wasn’t because of genuine talent, but only blind luck!”</p>
 <p>A fan suddenly appeared in Wu Yu’s hand, and while fanning himself, he laughingly said, “I’m afraid that some people here don’t even have blind luck, and yet they still think that they’re amazing.”</p>
 <p>Gu Liufeng promptly joined in, and laughed as he said, “Exactly! And who was it that said that intuition is not a type of strength? Perhaps some of the people who are a part of a certain sect will not have the strength to bluff well enough.”</p>
 <p>They both played off each other and ridiculed the Liu Li sect and Feng Lian Ying. When the disciples of Liu Li sect heard such mocking words, they were filled with indignation.</p>
 <p>Nie Jinchen was even more incensed and started cursing, “Gu Liufeng, don’t f*cking pretend to know what’s best!! Do any of you have the qualifications to slander Little Sister Lian Ying and the Liu Li sect? Do you think that I won’t kill you?!”</p>
 <p>Wu Yu waved the fan as he chuckled, “Ohh, so you’re going to kill people to silence them? I’m so scared! I wonder who it was that was just in the Major Cloud array asking my Master not to kill them!”</p>
 <p>Since eating Hexi’s delicious food, Wu Yu had firmly established the principle of unwaveringly holding the Princess’s words on a high pedestal.</p>
 <p>If Princess were to ever argue with his Master, he would undoubtedly support Princess to the end.</p>
 <p>Yeah, everything is worth it for food!</p>
 <p>Gu Liufeng saw Feng Lian Ying’s extremely unsightly faced, and sneered, “Which one our words was slanderous? Wasn’t it because of your Liu Li sect’s Ice Lotus Fairy that more people lost consciousness?”</p>
 <p>At that time, many martial artists had entered the medicinal field and fallen unconscious because of Feng Lian Ying’s Assembling Soul Fragrance.</p>
 <p>Feng Yunjing glanced at Wu Yu, then looked at Nangong Yu; a corner of his mouth rising slightly. “How come I was unaware that the servants from Hell King Manor could be so uncontrolled?”</p>
