 <p><strong>Chapter 67 - The Legendary Hell King</strong></p>
 <p>Hexi smelled it and disdainfully curled her lips, throwing the bottle towards Xumi Palace, “So arrogant and yet it’s only a second rate medicine, the quality not even achieving complete fusion. Dan Dan, I'll give this to you to eat!”</p>
 <p>Dan Dan happily swallowed the medicine, shouting frankly that it still wanted more.</p>
 <p>This little guy, from head to tail and from top to bottom, really is an eater. Wanting to eat the sword and spirit tools, spiritual plants and magic pills, it also wants to eat properly cooked food. It eats so much, yet why doesn't it show even the tiniest sign that it's shell will crack, does it want to make her bankrupt?</p>
 <p>Hexi helplessly came out from her space, secretly praying in her heart. She only wished that when Dan Dan hatched in the future, it wouldn't be so spoiled, otherwise, she would become penniless.</p>
 <p>***</p>
 <p>Waking up the next day, Hexi happily discovered that the pain in her meridians and dantian had almost disappeared.</p>
 <p>After hesitating for a while, she finally decided to go on time to meet Nangong Yu at Wan Feng tea house.</p>
 <p>Although Zhu Que’s warning and attack yesterday had made her very unhappy, being able to advance her strength is more important.</p>
 <p>However, just before she left, Hexi called Mo San to ask him about Hell King’s background.</p>
 <p>Mo San’s face now looked lively, it was no longer in a state of panic like when he was controlled, his attitude towards Hexi more respectful, “Answering Master, His Highness, Hell King, can be said to be our Jin Ling country’s number one man. Regardless of whether it's his strength or control, the power in his hand makes even Jin Ling's royal family, and every influential family, not dare to rashly provoke him.”</p>
 <p>“This subordinate once heard that he possessed amazing innate talent, becoming a Gold Core martial artist at the age of fifteen. At the time his core was formed, the Ninth Heaven's Black Thunder appeared in the sky, shocking the entire Mi Luo Continent. Afterwards, because all the influential parties were afraid of his powerful innate talent, they at once sent the highest level martial artists to secretly kill him. But no one was able to injure the Hell King in the slightest, instead, they all died in his hands.”</p>
 <p>Hexi frowned, her heart shocked by Nangong Yu’s powerful strength. He was just fifteen years old when he had reached Gold Core stage?</p>
 <p>Mo San continued, “It is said that the Hell King’s outward appearance is handsome, just like a demon, surpassing the beauty of a woman, yet his temperament is extremely cold and mercilessly cruel when killing. Two years ago, the troops from Magical Beasts in the West of Gui Jin mountain range suddenly assembled, invading Jin Ling's border in a large scale attack. The King of Jin Ling dispatched several tens of thousand elite troops to face the enemy, but their General was killed by Magical Beasts, then the whole army was destroyed. At that time, people in Jin Ling were panicking, thinking that the day people would starve and their country would fall to ruin had come. Though unexpectedly, the mere eighteen year old Hell King had suddenly led thousands of Metal Qilin troops to the Gui Jin mountain range, and with his strength, he killed the leader of Magical Beasts, then annihilated the troops from Magical Beasts.”</p>
 <p>“Some people said that the war was extremely tragic, flesh and blood flying everywhere, people blown to pieces, until the soil on the battlefield on Gui Jin mountain range was soaked by blood, so that to this day, it's still a reddish brown. If ordinary people near the battlefield, their seven apertures[1] will shed blood because of the impact of the land. The title of his Highness, the King of Hell, was bestowed from the war, it means ‘King of the Underworld, ruling over the life and death of the human world, controlling the Six Paths of Reincarnation[2]’.”</p>
 <p>Hexi momentarily couldn't calm down after hearing Mo san's recounting.</p>
 <p>Extremely cold temperament, mercilessly cruel when killing...ruling over the life and death of the human world, controlling the Six Paths of Reincarnation...but what appeared before her eyes was only a man with demonic charm and an annoying smiling expression. Were these two very different people really the same person?</p>
 <p>***</p>
 <p>Hexi ate breakfast, then seeing the time had reached Chen[3], she prepared to leave.</p>
 <p>After just leaving the courtyard's small path, under the mount cliff not far away, she could see two children squatting.</p>
 <p>The boy looked to be around fifteen to sixteen years old, while the girl looked to be around seven to eight years old, both of them wearing shabby clothes.</p>
