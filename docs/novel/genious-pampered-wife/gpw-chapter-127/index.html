 <p><strong>Chapter 127 - Annihilated</strong></p>
 <p>Nangong Yu looked down at them with an indifferent expression, his bloodshot eyes covered with a layer of frost, “Speak! If you tell me who the mastermind is, I'll let the assassins from Drought Demon Organisation off.”</p>
 <p>That means that he really intends to destroy all of the assassins from Drought Demon Organisation if they don't reveal anything!</p>
 <p>The hopeful expression on the leader's face crumpled, changing into one of utter despair. But, when facing this excessively strong young man, he didn't have any courage to resist answering, “We...we don’t know who requested the mission. All the Drought Demon Organisation deals with is receiving the mission from the black market, we just take the money without asking questions.”</p>
 <p>“Since this is the case…” The corner of Nangong Yu’s mouth raised into a cruel smile, “Then your existence is unnecessary.”</p>
 <p>He had barely spoken, when a bright ball of spiritual power suddenly formed on his slightly raised left hand.</p>
 <p>The assassin kneeling at Nangong Yu’s feet screamed with fear and he wanted to flee, but without being able to take even a single step, the ball of spiritual power ball wrapped itself around his body, and that of the other assassin.</p>
 <p>Soon after their bodies felt like there was something drilling into them, and the surface of their skin began to swell with uneven bumps.</p>
 <p><em>“Ah ah ah ah---!!”</em> The assassins screamed in pain, and following that their bodies ripped apart, leaving only blood and bones splattered around.</p>
 <p>However, the ball of spiritual power hadn't finished its destruction yet, continuing to burn the blood and bones with a faint blue flame until it completely eroded everything, leaving nothing but ash. Only then did the spiritual fire slowly disappear without a trace.</p>
 <p>Nangong Yu glanced at the wind spreading the ash of the two assassins into the air. Then sneering, he held Hexi, and rapidly flew back to Hell King Manor.</p>
 <p>****</p>
 <p>Hell King Manor.</p>
 <p>Qing Long, Bai Hu, and Zhu Que were standing at the gate, from time to time they would look at the sky with worried expressions.</p>
 <p>Bai Hu incessantly muttered out of nervousness, “It's already reached this point, the time when Master’s illness is about to flare, so why would he suddenly go out? Why has he still not returned?”</p>
 <p>At this moment, Zhu Que who was standing next to him had her face covered with a veil, concealing that eye catching scar.</p>
 <p>Hearing what was said, her eyes filled with worry, “Qing Long, do you know why Master went out today, leaving his closed door cultivation early?”</p>
 <p>It was to lift the seal on Xi Yue, the Genius Doctor Xi’s dantian!</p>
 <p>Of course Qing Long knew what his Master went out to do, and he extremely disagreed with it. But Master is the Master, and as long as he is commanded not to say anything, even if Qing Long was anxious, he would never speak without permission.</p>
 <p>He has always been quiet from the beginning, refusing to answer any questions, so Bai Hu and Zhu Que weren't surprised.</p>
 <p>However, as Qing Long looked at the sky for a long while, a gloomy expression covered his face and he opened his mouth to say, “Bai Hu, Zhu Que, if someone’s existence will harm Master, but Master wouldn't hesitate to protect him, you...what would you do?”</p>
 <p>Bai Hu answered, “Of course Master’s will is the priority!”</p>
 <p>While Zhu Que answered, “Of course the cheap person who will threaten Master must be killed!”</p>
 <p>The two people almost responded in unison, and after they finished speaking they looked at each other in dismay, each with a complicated expression on their face. Even Qing Long’s eyebrows were creased, his face twisted.</p>
 <p>Just then, Qing long’s expression lit up and he shouted with a low voice, “Master’s returned!”</p>
 <p>The next moment, Nangong Yu descended from the sky with his robes floating around him, landing by Hell King Manor’s big gate.</p>
 <p>Qing Long was just about to come forward, wanting to follow, when suddenly he looked at the bloody figure in Master’s arms, his eyes opening wide, “Master, this...is this Genius Doctor Xi?!”</p>
