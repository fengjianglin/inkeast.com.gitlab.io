 <p><strong>Chapter 316 - Last Hope</strong></p>
 <p>Nangong Yu grabbed Gu Liufeng’s collar and dragged him back like a small chicken, throwing him in front of Hexi. Then, leaning close to her, he softly whispered, “Reward!”</p>
 <p>Hexi remained silent. Looking over, she saw him with his face turned to the side and staring at her with a look which explicitly demanded that she kisses him. Hexi immediately turned away.</p>
 <p>Nangong Yu wasn’t annoyed. Instead, he took her into his arms and lightly pecked her on a corner of her mouth, and then with a husky voice, he whispered in her ear, “Princess refused to take the initiative and reward me, so I had to collect it for myself. I had to exert myself and make an effort; I can’t lose at all!”</p>
 <p>“Scoundrel!” Hexi fiercely glared at him, then turned her head away and refused to look at him. However, both of her cheeks were bright crimson.</p>
 <p>Feng Yunjing saw this scene from where he was standing, and his expression suddenly became gloomy. A cold aura, like a poisonous snake, seemed to circulate within his deep eyes.</p>
 <p>“Ah-ahh--!!”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, an ear-piercing scream came from within the medicinal field.</p>
 <p>The martial artists who’d been unconscious in the medicinal field abruptly started to awaken; one after the other.</p>
 <p>But the red rash on everyone’s faces had morphed into red and purple blood blisters; some people’s blisters seeming to grow faster than others. In a moment, the blood blisters continued to swell, and then pop!</p>
 <p>Next, yellow-red blood flowed down their bodies; their appearances were even more horrible than the evil spirits that crawled out of hell.</p>
 <p>The faces’ of everyone standing outside the medicinal field were full of fear, and they quickly rushed backwards.</p>
 <p>Some of those who had small guts and a weak tolerance had already started wailing while rushing to the side and vomiting.</p>
 <p>The medicinal field before their eyes was like a scene of hell on earth.</p>
 <p>Abruptly, a person whose whole body was decaying, his original appearance unrecognisable, rushed while stumbling towards Feng Lian Ying.</p>
 <p>He kneeled down in front of Feng Lian Ying, hissing and wailing, “Ice Lotus Fairy, save me! I’m Shangguan Rui!”</p>
 <p>“You can break the Mind Confusion scent; you must have a way to heal us! You’re also the direct disciple of Thousand Venom Valley’s Master! No one in the world can save us except for you! I’m begging you!”</p>
 <p>When Shangguan Rui said this, everyone in the medicinal field who had been filled with despair suddenly latched onto those words as their last hope.</p>
 <p>People immediately surged towards Feng Lian Ying like a tide, and shouted, “Ice Lotus Fairy, save us!!”</p>
 <p>These people were currently unaware of how horrible their appearances were at this moment.</p>
 <p>Moreover, even after having been alive for so many years, none of them had ever seen such a terrible illness before.</p>
 <p>Now, they all had the appearances of zombies; it was almost like they’d been sentenced to the death penalty.</p>
 <p>However, while no one really wanted to die, they also didn’t want to live as they were either. As long as there was a glimmer of hope, they would hang on to it at all costs.</p>
 <p>What’s more, who in all of Mi Luo Continent didn’t know of Ice Lotus Fairy’s reputation.</p>
 <p>At such a young age she was already a fifth rank doctor, an intermediate level member of the Doctors Association, and a direct disciple of Thousand Venom Valley’s Master.</p>
 <p>With her here, maybe they still had a chance...No! With Ice Lotus Fairy here, they would undoubtedly be saved!</p>
 <p>Feng Lian Ying saw all of their sinister and disgusting faces, and the fear and loathing in her heart reached extreme levels.</p>
 <p>She felt like the air was filled with a fishy smell, making her itch to kick these nauseating people away.</p>
 <p>However, it was at this moment that Wu Yu waved his fan, and raised his voice as he said, “Everyone can rest assured, Ice Lotus Fairy has the heart of a Bodhisattva; kind and charitable. When everyone is suffering so terribly, how could she just bear watching?”</p>
 <p>“Not to mention, her medical skills are excellent, and she has a crucial position in the Doctors Association. Naturally, she can find a way to heal you. If even this cannot be done, wouldn’t she be ruining her name as Ice Lotus Fairy?”</p>
