 <p><strong>Chapter 249 - Mutual Destruction</strong></p>
 <p>Feng Lian Ying held the red medicinal pill in her hand with a conflicted expression on her face.</p>
 <p>This red pill was called a Red Phosphorus Pill. It was one of Liu Li sect’s secret protection methods, and a pill that was used to save a life in a crisis.</p>
 <p>Once you took a Red Phosphorus Pill, no matter how serious a martial artist was injured it would heal in a flash. Regardless of being infected by any poison, it would also completely clear up. Even the user’s cultivation base would rise in a short time period, with their spiritual power increasing several fold.</p>
 <p>However, this powerful red pill wasn’t without side effects. After taking a Red Phosphorus Pill, the martial artist’s meridians would be damaged to a certain extent, and they would lose the possibility of advancing for at least three years. Therefore, unless they had reached a moment where they needed to use it as a last resort, the disciples of Liu Li sect absolutely wouldn’t take it.</p>
 <p>Feng Lian Ying had always been ambitious and lofty. Desperately pursuing Nangong Yu’s steps, she had initially planned to advance to Nascent Soul stage within ten years to be on an equal level with him. However, if she took this pill her desire would become only a dream, because it would be impossible to improve her cultivation base in such a short time, let alone reaching Nascent Soul stage.</p>
 <p>But just the thought of Hexi, that bastard, as well as his and Nangong Yu’s intimate scene, Feng Lian Ying was burning with the fires of jealousy; completely losing all rationality.</p>
 <p>So much so that she didn’t carefully notice that at this moment, the poison that had been congealing in her dantian was slowly weakening and dissipating.</p>
 <p>After all, when Hexi had made her poisons she was only at Foundation Establishment stage. So for a Foundation Establishment stage’s cultivation base being able to manufacture a poison harmful to a Gold Core stage martial artist, that was as difficult as wanting to ascend to heaven.</p>
 <p>If only Feng Lian Ying had being paying attention, instead of being blinded by her jealousy and fear, she would’ve known that the poison simply couldn’t injure her. At most, it could only add a few dark spots on her skin.</p>
 <p>Feng Lian Ying’s expression twisted, and suddenly raising her hand, she swallowed the Red Phosphorus Pill.</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, her spiritual power increased sharply from the energy throughout the secret territory, giving off an ominous feeling.</p>
 <p>The Ice Crystal Sword abruptly appeared in her hand once more, and Feng Lian Ying’s body slowly rose into the air to hover in place.</p>
 <p>She then looked down in contempt and disgust at Hexi and Zhou Yan’an below her, like she would stare at tiny ants.</p>
 <p>“Xi Yue, you made this Fairy lose the Inheritance, and made me pay such a big price by taking the Red Phosphorus Pill. I swear that today I’ll cut off your limbs and destroy your dantian, making it so that you’ll spend the rest of your life as neither a person nor a ghost in a boundless hell! This is the price you have to pay for committing an offence against me, Ice Lotus Fairy!”</p>
 <p>After her words, Feng Lian Ying’s body shook, and the Ice Crystal Sword fused together with her body as she charged straight towards Hexi like a tornado.</p>
 <p>Zhou Yan’an exclaimed out loud, his face filled with despair.</p>
 <p>Hexi pursed her lips as she stood her ground, a formidable spiritual power vortex slowly condensing in her hand.</p>
 <p>This spiritual power wasn’t only her made of her own power, but part of her space’s unimaginably vast spiritual power.</p>
 <p>Once this spiritual power vortex exploded, not only would Hexi and Feng Lian Ying die, this entire area of the secret territory would be affected.</p>
 <p>However, Hexi’s expression only showed a cold determination. There was neither remorse or indecision, rather, there was a determination capable of destroying heaven and exterminating earth; a conviction to die in mutual destruction.</p>
 <p>She had said once before that even if she should die, she would certainly make Feng Lian Ying pay a painful price! That price was death!!</p>
 <p>But, just as the condensation of her spiritual power vortex started spinning faster and faster, and the Ice Crystal Sword in Feng Lian Ying’s hand drew closer to her...</p>
 <p>A sudden scarlet light shone before Hexi’s eyes; blinding her. But before she had time to react, it enveloped herself and Zhou Yan’an.</p>
