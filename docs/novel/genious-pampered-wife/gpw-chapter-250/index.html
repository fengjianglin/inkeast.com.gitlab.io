 <p><strong>Chapter 250 - Gu Liufeng</strong></p>
 <p>A loud bang echoed around the area, and the Ice Crystal Sword very quickly turned into steam and evaporated into the air as it hit the barrier of red light. Additionally, the barrier of red light slowly dissipated from the impact of the Ice Crystal Sword, similar to when ice and fire collided and melted.</p>
 <p>The next moment, Feng Lian Ying’s body was thrown backwards far into the distance. And as she coldly and gloomy glared at the barrier of red light, it disappeared without a trace.</p>
 <p>Before Hexi had time to react, Zhou Yan’an became startled and shouted in delight, “Young Master, you finally came!”</p>
 <p>Along with Zhou Yan’an’s words, a figure in bright red clothes appeared in front of Hexi.</p>
 <p>From Hexi’s angle she could only see that this person was slender and wearing a white mask on his face. Painted on the white mask was a queer ghost pattern, making the person look somewhat sinister. His pair of peach blossom eyes that weren’t covered by the mask were gleaming like the reflection of waves under sunlight; a beauty that gave people a one of a kind feeling of attraction.</p>
 <p>Once Feng Lian Ying noticed the white mask on the person’s face, she couldn’t help but cry out in alarm, “Gu Liufeng!”</p>
 <p>Although Hexi had never heard the name of Gu Liufeng before, she was very aware of Sheng De Hall in Yan Jing City. While its appearance was that of a small medical store, in actuality, it was a powerful intelligence organisation. And the organisation behind it mustn’t be underestimated.</p>
 <p>And it could be assumed, that the man addressed as Young Master by Zhou Yan’an, was the owner of Sheng De Hall.</p>
 <p>Gu Liufeng unhurriedly opened his mouth and said, “Ice Lotus Fairy, long time no see. I trust you’ve been well since we last met?”</p>
 <p>Having heard what he said, the look on Feng Lian Ying’s face twisted with fierceness!</p>
 <p><em>She didn’t understand; all she wanted to do was kill a Foundation Establishment stage brat! It should’ve been very easy, but why did someone constantly appear to hinder her? Is that brat really so lucky?</em></p>
 <p>Feng Lian Ying grit her teeth as she answered, “Gu Liufeng, can it be that you want to meddle in my business too? Granted that if you want to meddle, you have to consider whether or not your strength is a match with Liu Li’s sect!”</p>
 <p>Since Gu Liufeng was wearing a mask his expression couldn’t be clearly seen. But even so, his voice gave a sense of laziness and indifference. “Fairy is so serious, the thing I dislike the most is meddling in other people’s business. Similarly my, Gu Liufeng’s people, also absolutely don’t turn to other people to teach someone a lesson! I wonder how shopkeeper Zhou offended Fairy, to the extent that Fairy was using heavy hands on him?”</p>
 <p>Feng Lian Ying’s gaze shot back and forth between Zhou Yan’an and Gu Liufeng, a glint of coldness flashing within her eyes as she said, “The one to start a feud with this fairy wasn’t really shopkeeper Zhou, but rather that Foundation Establishment stage stinky brat. So if you grab your man and leave now, making him vow to never reveal what happened today, I’ll let you off. How is it?”</p>
 <p>After Feng Lian Ying finished speaking, the look on Zhou Yan’an’s face became apprehensive.</p>
 <p>He anxiously looked at Hexi and couldn’t help but move his gaze to Gu Liufeng, taking quite a while before he mustered enough courage to say, “Young Master, I owe Young Master Xi a debt for saving my life, I...I can’t abandon him, no matter what.”</p>
 <p>However Gu Liufeng seemed as if he hadn’t heard him, he just slightly narrowed his eyes as he stared at the arrogant Feng Lian Ying in front of him and faintly sighed, “It seems as if Ice Lotus Fairy has misunderstood my intentions. Who said I asked you to let shopkeeper Zhou off?”</p>
 <p>Hearing this, a smug smile graced Feng Lian Ying’s face. “Since Young Master Gu understands the advantages and disadvantages, then that’s for the best. Zhou Yan’an has dishonoured this Fairy, so he should be given a lesson. I can promise that this Fairy will be able to keep his little life.”</p>
