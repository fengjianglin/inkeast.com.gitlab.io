 <p><strong>Chapter 248 - Terrible Poison</strong></p>
 <p>But Hexi didn’t stop to rest, and instead waved the White Bone Whip in her hand. Her aura picturesque as she flew over and appeared before Feng Lian Ying.</p>
 <p>Feng Lian Ying, who was immersed in her shock and hatred, suddenly snapped out from her thoughts with a burst of killing intent within her eyes.</p>
 <p>“Bastard, so you want to sneak attack me with your minuscule abilities?! In your dreams!”</p>
 <p>After speaking, about a dozen swords appears in her hand and she immediately charged towards the White Bone Whip. As they collided, the White Bone Whip was chopped apart inch by inch under the sword’s swinging; falling to the ground like small worms.</p>
 <p>As Hexi’s body was strongly pulled forward by Feng Lian Ying, she felt a palm harshly strike her chest.</p>
 <p>However, the moment the spiritual power reached Hexi’s body she swayed, and like a kite that had its string snapped, she flew into the air before spitting out a mouthful of blood.</p>
 <p>Feng Lian Ying had missed Hexi’s vital organs, but it was still enough oppression by immense spiritual power to make her Qi and blood surge, as well as cause pain in her five internal organs.</p>
 <p>Feng Lian Ying sneered in loathing, detest, and contempt. At this moment, the wound on her stomach had started to recover, and she used her towering frame to look down at Hexi. “No matter how hard you struggle, you’re just like a mantis trying to stop a chariot. Do you really think that with just your tiny cultivation base, that you can successfully attack me?”</p>
 <p>“You think I sacrificed my White Bone Whip and risked being injured in order to attack you?” The corner of Hexi’s mouth curled into a sneer as she continued, “Feng Lian Ying, could it be that until now you still haven’t realised that there’s something wrong with your wound?”</p>
 <p>Feng Lian Ying became alarmed and lowered her head to see the wound on her abdomen in disbelief, noticing that it had already started to coagulate with dark spots appearing around the wound. Her previously arrogant voice was now trembling due to fear. “You...what did you do to me?”</p>
 <p>Hexi supported her still stiff left shoulder as she stood up, laughing coldly, “I only smeared the drop of an interesting poison on you...this poison initially had no effect towards you Gold Core stage martial artists since the moment you become poisoned, you just need to take the antidote and you’ll be fine. But, Ice Lotus Fairy, apparently you let jealousy affect your mind. Now the poison has invaded your dantian and begun to spread throughout your meridians. How does it feel?”</p>
 <p>“This is impossible! How could your poison hurt me?!” Desperation and panic flashed on Feng Lian Ying’s face.</p>
 <p>It must be known that martial artists of Gold Core stage were basically already immune to poison, unless it was highly poisonous like Dense Viper Orchid which was manufactured by a high level martial artist. Otherwise, a martial artist’s body itself would naturally repel the impurities from the poison.</p>
 <p><em>But now her body had really shown signs of being poisoned, and the circulation of her spiritual power was also slowing down! That brat was nothing but Foundation Establishment stage trash. He seemed to be about sixteen to seventeen years old, so how was it possible that he could concoct such a terrible poison?</em></p>
 <p>The Long Sword appeared once more in Feng Lian Ying’s hand as she aimed it at Hexi and screamed, “Bastard! If you don’t want to die, then immediately hand over the antidote!”</p>
 <p>Though Hexi’s complexion was pale and her voice was weak, her face still wore an indifferent sneer. “It should be me saying those words. If you want me to hand over the antidote, I can! Now kneel down and apologise for me!”</p>
 <p>“Very well! Did you think that with just an insignificant poison that this Fairy would really be afraid?!”</p>
 <p>Feng Lian Ying’s expression twisted, and suddenly, a dark red medicinal pill appeared on her hand.</p>
 <p>As soon as that medicinal pill appeared, it emitted a delicate fragrance. Even if you were to merely smell this fragrance, it could give anyone a feeling of their spiritual power becoming incessantly agitated.</p>
