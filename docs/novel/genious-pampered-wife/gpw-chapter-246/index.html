 <p><strong>Chapter 246 - Dual Attributes Of Water And Fire, Heavenly Spiritual Roots</strong></p>
 <p>“Bastard, if you have the abilities then don’t hide! Do you think that just because you can hide, you can really avoid my attack?!”</p>
 <p>Feng Lian Ying gnashed her teeth, and with her figure blurring, a barrage of blazing darts flew everywhere.</p>
 <p>With the darts practically flying all around, no matter how fast Hexi moved, it was impossible for her to dodge this round of attack.</p>
 <p>Internally overjoyed, the corner of Feng Lian Ying’s mouth curled into a sinister smile as she imagined all the holes about to be poked into Hexi; turning her into a sieve.</p>
 <p>However the next moment, her wide smile froze.</p>
 <p>She watched as those burning darts, after gaining a few meters, suddenly seemed like they encountered something. Unexpectedly it slowed down their speed, and somehow, it began to force the darts to face a different direction, before they wobbled in the air and fell to the ground.</p>
 <p>Next, the flames slowly extinguished. When she saw this, Feng Lian Ying’s face was so gloomy that it looked like it was almost dripping water, appearing particularly cold.</p>
 <p>Hexi unhurriedly appeared before Feng Lian Ying once more, but this time, she was accompanied by countless clones that flashed into view one after another.</p>
 <p>Each one of the clones had a contemptuous sneer on their face, while a melodious and penetrating voice rang out carrying a cold murderous aura, “Ice Lotus Fairy, your trick was only so-so!”</p>
 <p>This was a technique that Hexi had used when she was still an assassin; Illusionary Step. Originally, if she would’ve used this technique on a martial artist with a high Divine Sense, it wouldn’t have been effective at all. However, now that Hexi had advanced, her spiritual power and speed had greatly increased.</p>
 <p>In this world of martial artists, only the swiftness of a person’s speed defined the winner. Therefore, now that she was using Illusionary Step, even Feng Lian Ying on Gold Core stage was unable to see where Hexi’s real body was.</p>
 <p>“Good, very good! I never would’ve thought that mere Foundation Establishment stage trash could’ve pushed me up to this point!”</p>
 <p>The fury on Feng Lian Ying’s face slowly vanished, transforming into a deep coldness. Loosening the grip of her right hand, her Long Sword worth several million spirit stones fell to the ground and produced a clang as it hit.</p>
 <p>“It seems that you obtaining Zijin Palace’s Inheritance wasn’t purely by luck. But since it’s this way, it’s even more reason for me to not allow you to keep on living! People like you would be a threat to me in the future, so it’s better to eradicate you while you’re still weak. Moreover since you also attempted to seduce Brother Yu, if I’m unable to kill you today, I’ll be in great trouble!”</p>
 <p>The next moment, the shadow of a sword slowly formed in Feng Lian Ying’s hand.</p>
 <p>But this sword was different from the previous fire attribute Long Sword; this sword’s entire body seemed to emit the coldness of ice spiritual power. The sword flickered, and the spiritual herbs around the sword completely froze, and at a speed visible to the naked eye, the frost spread to cover the ground all around it.</p>
 <p>Zhou Yan’an cried out in alarm, “The Ice Crystal Sword! A top-graded weapon, the Ice Crystal Sword...you...don’t you have fire spiritual roots? Why are you able to use the Ice Crystal Sword?”</p>
 <p>Feng Lian Ying slightly raised her chin, an arrogant smile breaking across her face. “Why do you think this Fairy can be called the thousand year unparalleled genius martial artist of Liu Li sect? It’s because I have the rare dual attributes of water and fire, two of the heavenly spiritual roots of the world.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Yan’an was dumbstruck. Dual attributes of the heavenly spiritual roots, where both attributes were completely unrelated! The dual attributes of water and fire, two of the heavenly spiritual roots, were represented when a martial artist practiced water and fire attribute cultivation methods. If practiced correctly, instead of each attribute cancelling each other out, it could result in each one complementing the other.</p>
 <p><em>If you were a martial artist with just one attribute of the heavenly spiritual roots, you were already considered to be a rare genius in the world. Yet Feng Lian Ying was a Gold Core stage martial artist with dual attributes of the heavenly spiritual roots...how could Young Master Xi ever hope to defeat this woman?!</em></p>
