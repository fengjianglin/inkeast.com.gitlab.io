 <p><strong>Chapter 284 - Green Wood Realm</strong></p>
 <p>“I say Little Yue’er, you can’t favour one and discriminate against the rest, we’re partners that just fought side by side! You gave this guy something to eat, so can’t you give me something to eat too? We’ve not eaten for quite a while, so quickly give me some roast chicken too!”</p>
 <p>This time it was Zhou Yan’an’s turn to facepalm and shake his head; <em>He never would've thought that his Young Master could also be so shameless!</em></p>
 <p>Hexi felt her head started to pound due to these noisy guys. Hence, she took out several roast chickens that she had prepared long ago from her space and threw one to each person.</p>
 <p>Finally, the surroundings quieted down, leaving only the muffled noise of chicken being chewed.</p>
 <p>When it was Nangong Yu’s turn catch a roast chicken, he moved closer to Hexi and looked at her with resentment on his face. “I want an assorted cake, shark fin soup cooked over purple sand, Dragon and Phoenix golden nest…”</p>
 <p><em>Obviously, before it had only been him who was able to eat the dishes made by Xi’er, yet now this group of brats had managed to taste it! Nangong Yu was unwilling to accept it! Extremely unwilling!</em></p>
 <p>Seeing them all eating with looks of enjoyment, he was really itching to squish their stupid faces into a mud pit.</p>
 <p>A corner of Hexi’s mouth twitched as she retrieved her hand that was about to give him the roast chicken. “It’s up to you whether you want to eat it or not, I don’t care!”</p>
 <p><em>This guy actually dared to order food, did he think of her as a cook?</em></p>
 <p>Nangong Yu quickly grabbed the roast chicken from her hand and taking advantage of the situation, her embraced her waist and whispered in her ear, “I said before that you’re not allowed to make food for others to eat as Xi’er’s taste only belongs to me, hmm?”</p>
 <p>Hexi responded by kicking him away with distaste.</p>
 <p>****</p>
 <p>After lunch, they took a moment to take a break and reorganise before preparing to continue on their journey.</p>
 <p>According to the map on the jade slip that Nangong Yu had previously obtained, they were currently located in the Green Wood Realm, in the inner layer of the Sealed Dragon Domain.</p>
 <p>There were no treasures that people would fight over in the Green Wood Realm, only many fierce demonic beasts that were roaming around. Therefore, not many martial artists would specifically go out of their way to come here.</p>
 <p>However, according to Wu Yu’s exploration, there was a medicinal field located in the Green Wood Realm where Zijin’s Master had grown his lifetime collection of spiritual herbs. Originally, the medicinal field had a strong rate of herb survival and after a thousand of years of growth, the plants inside must be very precious.</p>
 <p>Nangong Yu knew that Hexi’s medical skill was superb and that she was very interested in collecting uncommon spiritual plants. Since Gu Liufeng and the others didn’t have anything they particularly wanted to do, they decided to proceed towards the medicinal field.</p>
 <p>In fact, the thing Hexi most wanted to find at this moment was the ‘key’ to gain control over the secret territory. Unfortunately, she had had no idea that each layer of the secret territory was so dangerous and anyway if they wanted to leave the Green Wood Realm, they needed to find the formation[1] location which couldn’t be done within a short amount of time. Hence, she could only give up.</p>
 <p>Moreover, there would certainly be many precious spiritual plants to be found in Zijin Master’s medicinal field and she wanted to take the opportunity to see if she could find the Divine Dragon Fruit that the little dragon needed. If she could, then that would be great.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, she recalled something that the little dragon had said about the Burning Heaven Realm. Green Wood Realm...Burning Heaven Realm...did this mean that the Burning Heaven Realm might also be part of the Sealed Dragon Domain? The more she thought about it, the more likely she figured that she was correct. She was now starting to become a little impatient about gaining control of the secret territory.</p>
 <p>Green Wood Realm wasn’t large, so in merely half a day they had managed to spot the location of the medicinal field and found that it was enveloped by a white fog.</p>
 <p>The reason there was a fog was that this area could be considered the most sought after location in the entire Green Wood Realm.</p>
 <p>The white fog should be covering Zijin Master’s medicinal field where he had planted the spiritual plants, but examining it from the outside, the scene inside was indistinct and they were completely unable to see anything clearly.</p>
 <p>There were at least a dozen martial artists surrounding the white fog. Most of them were only Meridians stage, but there were also a few Gold Core stage martial artists. All of them were gazing towards the fog with a grave expression; an excited and anxious aura surrounding them.</p>
 <p>When Hexi and her group approached, they all turned around and glared at them, many of their faces morphing into a grave and dreadful expression.</p>

 <p>[1] Formation – Divided into battle formations and spell formations; although they are often just called “formations”. Battle formations are tactical formations used by several cultivators or martial artists attacking in concert. Spell formations are also called Arrays. They’re essentially magic circles which cast a continuous area-of-effect spell on the location the formation encompasses.</p>
