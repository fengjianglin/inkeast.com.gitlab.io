 <p>Nangong Yu’s expression was indifferent, and he carelessly said, “He’s new and still doesn’t understand the rules. Yunjing, you don’t have to bother about him.”</p>
 <p>At this moment, Wu Yu was disguised as an ordinary bodyguard, but where was there a bodyguard who had enough guts to provoke the Feng family! This, together with Nangong Yu’s cold attitude; Feng Yunjing clearly understood that he was being lied to!</p>
 <p>Wu Yu wanted to say something more, but Qing Long stepped forward and lightly pressed his hand down on Wu Yu’s shoulder; shaking his head at him.</p>
 <p>Now was not the time to cause trouble with the Liu Li sect. Otherwise, all of their Master’s previous work would be ruined.</p>
 <p>Wu Yu curled his lip as he closed his mouth and didn’t say anything further.</p>
 <p>At this moment, the two men who had appeared with blood blisters and pus dripping down their bodies started crawling away from the medicinal field.</p>
 <p>As soon as they saw Feng Lian Ying, their eyes lit up, and they staggered towards her.</p>
 <p>Wherever they went, the other martial artists avoided them as if they were poisonous snakes.</p>
 <p>Feng Lian Ying also wanted to run away, but because of her fear, her feet failed to move.</p>
 <p>“Ice Lotus fairy, save us-!!” Wretched shouts resounded throughout the medicinal field.</p>
 <p>The two men plopped to the ground to kneel in front of Feng Lian Ying, hissing in pain as they yelled, “I’m...the Master of the Murong family; Murong Zhangfeng. My Murong family has always been on peaceful terms with the Liu Li sect. I beg you; please save us!”</p>
 <p>As soon as the words left his mouth, everyone couldn’t help but be surprised.</p>
 <p>These two people covered in blood blisters who couldn’t be recognised unexpectedly turned out to be the Master of the Murong family; Murong Zhangfeng, someone from one of the four major families of Yan Jing City.</p>
 <p>The other was Murong Zhangfeng’s Father, the Elder of Murong manor; Murong Hai, Yan Jing City’s famous third rank doctor.</p>
 <p>These two people suddenly threw themselves before Feng Lian Ying, their fingers stretching to touch her delicate hand. Their pus and blood covered hands already clutching her snow-white clothes.</p>
 <p>Feng Lian Ying was so terrified that her complexion lost all colour, turning a sickly pale as she stepped back several paces. Her eyes were full of horror and disgust.</p>
 <p>Feng Yunjing, who was watching from the side, frowned when he heard the two people reveal their identities, and asked, “How did you end up like this?”</p>
 <p>Seeing that the person questioning them was the Young Master of the Feng family; Feng Yunjing, how could they dare to delay answering? Enduring the acute pain wracking their bodies and the fear in their hearts, they quickly told the whole story.</p>
 <p>It turned out that the Murong family had been the first people to enter the medicinal field through the Major Cloud array.</p>
 <p>When they had first entered the medicinal field, they’d also discovered that there was the scent of Mind Confusion in the air that could cause a person to lose their mind.</p>
 <p>However, the Murong family had Murong Hai with them, a third rank doctor. Therefore, they were naturally unafraid of such a trifling poison.</p>
 <p>As soon as the Mind Confusion scent had been removed, they began to collect the herbs within the field.</p>
 <p>There were countless fifth grade spiritual plants within the medicinal field. And later, when someone noticed the hill that was glowing with colourful rays of light, they found sixth grade spiritual plants that could make one go insane with greed.</p>
 <p>But just as the Murong family were ecstatic, people from their group began to faint and become feverish.</p>
 <p>No matter how much Murong Hai examined them, he couldn’t discover why they’d fallen unconscious.</p>
 <p>What’s worse, was that the red rash began to spread on the faces’ of the unconscious people. The red rash grew at a speed that was visible to the naked eye before they then turned into giant blood blisters.</p>
 <p>These blood blister growing on their bodies were extremely itchy. So itchy, that even people with sharp minds couldn’t help but scratch.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, even if you didn’t scratch at them, after a while, the blisters would still pop and turn into a horribly bloody mess.</p>
 <p>Once the blood blisters began to burst, the person’s skin and internal organs would start rotting until they died.</p>
