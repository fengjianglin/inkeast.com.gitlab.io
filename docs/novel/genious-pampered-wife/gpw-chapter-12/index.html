 <p><strong>Chapter 12 – Kindness Will Be Repaid, Wrongs Must Be Avenged</strong></p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Having heard what Hexi said, the four guards relaxed. They looked at Hexi with extreme disdain.</p>
 <p>“Humph! You know your worth, it's good you know you don't the have qualifications to go against the Zhu Family. Release us immediately, perhaps our Master and his family will let you off!"</p>
 <p>Hexi ignored them, continuing with what she had been saying, “Killing all of you is simply too good for you. Since you look down upon ordinary people so much, in your lifetime, you should properly experience feeling like an ordinary person!”</p>
 <p>Finished speaking, the Invisible Needles in her hands suddenly flew.</p>
 <p>This time though, the Invisible Needles didn’t shoot towards the acupuncture point used to seal their Dantian. Rather it was towards their central Dantian, Sea of Qi.</p>
 <p>Their ears seemed to hear a soft ‘chi’ sound, the next moment intense Spiritual Energy flashed throughout the air.</p>
 <p>“Ah ah ah ah--------!!!!” Mournful sounds suddenly erupted. Like the wailing of ghosts and the howling of wolves, the screams resonated through the sky.</p>
 <p>The four guards suddenly felt as though they had been broken, they could no longer store spiritual power. Every inch of the meridians in their bodies’ no longer carried any spiritual power.</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, they could no longer feel the pulse of their Dantian. They couldn’t even feel any activity in their spiritual energy.</p>
 <p>And so their complexions, with a speed visible to the naked eye, rapidly aged! Just a few short breaths, and they changed from being in their thirties, in the prime of life, into sixty year old men.</p>
 <p>Having their Dantians’ broken caused the stored spiritual energy to dissipate, their cultivation bases’ disappearing in a flash.</p>
 <p>A person's Dantian was hidden in the body, their spiritual power like a shelter for it. It's very near impossible to be able to destroy a person's Dantian.</p>
 <p>However, with Hexi relying on her formidable needle technique, and her understanding of the human body structure, she can easily accomplish it.</p>
 <p>From now on till forever, these four guards would no longer be able to cultivate. They would be unable to advance their cultivation stage. They have become what they most despised, ordinary people, a group of incompetent old men.</p>
 <p>Watching from the side were guards with cultivation bases at the Qi Refining stage. As quiet as a cicada in winter, they trembled in fear.</p>
 <p>Hexi glanced at them, “I have always repaid debts of gratitude with kindness, but enemies will be repaid with revenge. They messed with me so this is their fate. There are no grievances or hatred between us, so naturally I will not make a move on all of you.”</p>
 <p>When this was heard everyone exhaled in a long sigh, their hearts relaxing. The next minute, each and every one of them began to close their eyes and pretend to sleep.</p>
 <p>Even when Hexi started dragging Zhu Zhongba and those four guards, they still pretended not to see anything.</p>
 <p>This must be a joke, if the master of the Zhu family were to punish them, that is a small matter. If they provoked this great aunt, they would end up with a crippled cultivation base. Then if that happened, in this lifetime, they could considered to be finished.</p>
 <p>Therefore, Young Master Zhu, you have no other choice than to seek good fortune for yourself!</p>
 <p>At this time, the young master Zhu that was being pitied by everyone, looked like a dead pig as he was dragged to the courtyard's Welcoming Hall.</p>
 <p>When Hexi tied him to a pillar, the swollen pig headed face of young master Zhu slowly started to awaken.</p>
 <p>“You….what are you doing?”</p>
 <p>Zhu Zhongba’s eyes opened wide, his entire body was in pain, like someone had separated his muscles from the bones.</p>
 <p>But he was unable to do anything because suddenly, before his eyes, Hexi’s demonic smile once again appeared on her face. This type of psychological attack caused his mind to shutdown, breaking his spirit.</p>
 <p>Not waiting for Zhu Zhongba to speak, Hexi took out three Invisible Needles. With a flick of her hand, she threw them at Zhu Zhongba’s body.</p>
 <p>Zhu Zhongba could feel the meridians in his body become sluggish. His Dantian felt like it was sealed, no longer was he able to use spiritual power.</p>
 <p>Of course, this kind of technique of sealing the meridians and Dantian, was different to becoming permanently crippled. It was merely sealing the cultivation base for a short time.</p>
 <p>This time Hexi had used three Invisible Needles. The Zhu Zhongba that had a cultivation base on the Qi Refining stage, for a short time, he wouldn’t be able to use spiritual power internally.</p>
 <p>Immediately after, Hexi took out several needles attached with the Slave Restriction spell, ruthlessly inserting them into Zhu Zhongba’s brain.</p>
 <p>The Invisible Needles instantly disappeared into his huge head. Hexi placed her hand on the vein on Zhu Zhongba’s wrist. Confirming that the Invisible Needles and Slave Restriction spell were already in his internal brain, forming the Brain Domain Restriction spell, she released her hand.</p>
