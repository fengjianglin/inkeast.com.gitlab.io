 <p><strong>Chapter 264 - Believe In Your Man</strong></p>
 <p>While carrying Hexi, Nangong Yu exerted himself to turn around, then he gently pushed her to the side.</p>
 <p>Almost at the same time as she was in the air, Hexi turned her head to see behind her and noticed that a gigantic Roc bird had appeared.</p>
 <p>The Roc’s whole body was light brown. When its two enormous wings were spread out, it almost covered the entire valley. Its sharp beak seemed to flash like the cold tip of a bent blade as it faced their direction, threateningly aiming to pierce them.</p>
 <p>The appearance of this Roc was too sudden as it had appeared without any warning at all. It was as if it had torn it’s way out of an invisible space, so even Hexi’s Divine Senses hadn’t detected it.</p>
 <p>However, Nangong Yu had managed to sense it. Moreover, his first reaction was to shove Hexi aside.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, the Roc’s powerful and sharp beak severely pierced Nangong Yu’s left shoulder during his protection of her.</p>
 <p>Blood instantly splattered everywhere, dying Nangong Yu’s body with blood, and adding an additional wound on top of his previous one.</p>
 <p>“Nangong Yu…!”</p>
 <p>Hexi screamed in fear and wanted to rush towards him.</p>
 <p>But the next moment she found out that she couldn’t move, because her body was enveloped by a transparent spiritual barrier.</p>
 <p>She was confined by a void spiritual barrier!</p>
 <p>The moment Nangong Yu had pushed her away, he had wrapped her in a void spiritual barrier to protect and confine her.</p>
 <p><em>What does that bastard think he’s doing?!</em></p>
 <p>Just then, Hexi saw Nangong Yu stumble back several steps due to the impact, yet a corner of his mouth curled into a sneer.</p>
 <p>His hands suddenly gripped the Roc’s beak that was as solid as iron, and with all his strength, he lifted it up using its beak. Then, he ruthlessly smashed it to the ground.</p>
 <p>The strong smell of blood wafted towards the tip of Hexi’s nose. Examining Nangong Yu’s bloody left shoulder, as well as the wound on the left side of his chest that had yet to stop bleeding, she could no longer bear it and yelled, “Nangong Yu, you bastard, quickly release me!!”</p>
 <p>Although it was only for a short moment, Hexi had clearly sensed that Nangong Yu’s spiritual power was weakening.</p>
 <p>She recalled the warmth that had wrapped around her and protected her when space had ripped apart and twisted with that vortex, as well as Nangong Yu’s overly pale complexion.</p>
 <p>He must have expended too much spiritual power in that space distortion to protect her, and coupled with the injury on his chest, his current strength would be about thirty percent less than normal.</p>
 <p>However, that Roc was a fierce beast with a horrible amount of spiritual power pressure; it was even more powerful than the Golden Python. How could the current Nangong Yu deal with it and escape unscathed?</p>
 <p>After throwing the Roc, Nangong Yu’s figure swayed slightly and his face paled further.</p>
 <p>When he heard Hexi’s words, he laughed proudly, “Xi’er, you have to...believe in you man!”</p>
 <p>Just as his words faded his right hand unfolded, and in a flash a dark, slender, and Long Sword appeared in his hand.</p>
 <p>A black aura curled upwards from the sword’s body, and accompanied by the sword’s spiritual power, the originally clear blue sky of the secret territory suddenly turned completely dark.</p>
 <p>Next, following lightning and thunder, a gale erupted. It was a force that slowly built up power in the valley, capable of extinguishing heaven and earth.</p>
 <p>And at this moment, the Roc that had been knocked down stood up. But because of Nangong Yu’s attack, the feathers covering its entire body we’re now puffed up, while its brown beak was stained with blood. With its pair of fierce, bloodshot eyes, it appeared particularly frightening.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the Roc’s wings fiercely flapped, creating a violent gale that mixed with sand and pebbles as it attacked Nangong Yu.</p>
 <p>Hexi’s heart felt like it was being squeezed by something, and as she spoke, the voice escaping her mouth was hoarse and trembling, “Nangong Yu, quickly release me, do you hear me?!”</p>
 <p>Within the gale, Nangong Yu’s hair was being blown in every direction. His entire body was dyed red with blood and his clothes were disheveled. But nonetheless, he gave off a wild and unruly charm.</p>
