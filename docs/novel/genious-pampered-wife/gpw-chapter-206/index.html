 <p><strong>Chapter 206 - High Grade Spiritual Supplement Pill</strong></p>
 <p>Zhangsan believed in his Young Miss’s medical skill and ability. <em>If she was able to make him, a low level martial artist, advance from the third rank of Qi Refining stage, to the sixth rank of Qi Refining stage within a few short months; how could it be possible that the medicinal pills she refined were just an ordinary product?</em></p>
 <p>Zhangsan was waiting for quite a while, and after the servant boy had sent off the last client and noticed he was still sitting and waiting, he couldn’t help but sneer. “Fool, it’s useless for you to wait! In a moment, the result will come out and you’ll find out that you wasted one hundred crystals, you can’t…”</p>
 <p>The servant boy’s words hadn’t yet finished, when suddenly, a white bearded old man abruptly rushed out from the evaluation room.</p>
 <p>While he was running with an excited and/yet nervous look on his face, he yelled, “Number ninety seven? Who brought medicinal pill number ninety seven in to be appraised?”</p>
 <p>Zhangsan and the servant boy both stared blankly for a moment, before Zhangsan looked at the number plate in his hand. He was number ninety seven.</p>
 <p>With a glance, the white bearded old man caught sight of the wooden number plate in Zhangsan’s hand, and like a whirlwind, he rushed over to him. Grabbing Zhangsan’s hand, he shouted, “Was it you who brought in medicinal pill number ninety seven?”</p>
 <p>Zhangsan answered, “Yes, I am. Was there a problem with the medicinal pill?”</p>
 <p>“Was it you who found this medicinal pill? Where did you find it?” Zhangsan’s cultivation base was only at the sixth rank of Qi Refining stage, and moreover, it seemed that his overall innate talent was only ordinary. Of course the old man wouldn’t think that Zhangsan had refined this medicine.</p>
 <p>Zhangsan shook his head. “That medicine was refined by my Master, I didn’t find it.”</p>
 <p>The white bearded old man’s brows suddenly rose in surprise, a radiant light appearing in his muddy eyes. “You mean, your Master is the one who refined this medicinal pill? It wasn’t found? Do you have any other medicinal pills in your possession apart from this one?”</p>
 <p>Zhangsan nodded, and he couldn’t help but ask, “So how was it? What are the results of the medicinal pill?”</p>
 <p>However, the white bearded old man ignored his question and asked impatiently, “Which Great Master is your Master? Quickly take me to see him!”</p>
 <p>Zhangsan’s brows wrinkled. “If you have something to tell my Master, you can tell me instead. My Master is very busy; he has already given me full responsibility to handle all matters dealing with the medicinal pill.”</p>
 <p>Zhangsan had always been a shrewd person, so he was obviously aware that Hexi didn’t want her identity revealed. How could he stupidly expose Young Miss’s information?</p>
 <p>Hearing this, the white bearded old man became frustrated. However, thinking about how all Great Masters were temperamental and eccentric, he was also relieved.</p>
 <p>This time, when he looked back at Zhangsan, he was smiling. “So it’s like this; the results of your medicinal pill appraisal have already come out, and no one expected that it would actually be a first grade medicinal pill of the highest quality. Moreover, the appraisal found that the composition of the medicinal pill was perfect. This old man has never before seen such a perfect medicinal pill! Your Master’s strength absolutely already surpasses that of this Sect Master!”</p>
 <p>“How could that be possible?!” The servant boy exclaimed nearby, his expression one of shock and bewilderment as he looked at Zhangsan.</p>
 <p>As for Zhangsan, when the old man had passed over the appraisal results, he only glanced at it before his eyes widened with shock.</p>
 <p>First grade Spiritual Supplement Pill: contains ten crystals worth of spiritual power, ninety nine percent essence purity, and suitable for unrestricted long term usage.</p>
 <p><em>This...this information...was it really that of a first grade medicinal pill?! It was even stronger than a mid-level second grade medicinal pill!</em></p>
 <p>Firstly, the spiritual power contained in most top level first grade Spiritual Supplement Pills was at max only three crystals worth of spiritual power, and secondly, the ninety nine percent essence purity...that was enough to make martial artists go crazy with longing! It meant that even if a martial artist consumed many spiritual pills, they wouldn’t have to worry about an overaccumulation of spiritual power.</p>
 <p>This was practically an amazing way for a low level martial artist to advance by medicinal pill!</p>
 <p>“I am the Vice-Head of this Imperial Pharmaceutical Institution, and also a fourth ranked doctor. On behalf of the Imperial Pharmaceutical Institution, I wish to sign a long term contract with your Master for this high grade Spiritual Supplement Pill. If there are any conditions you may have, we can discuss…”</p>
