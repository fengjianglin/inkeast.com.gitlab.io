 <p><strong>Chapter 245 - Kowtow To Apologise</strong></p>
 <p>When Zhou Yan’an didn’t see him moving, he became anxious. “Young Master Xi, my...my spiritual power is used up, and my meridians are damaged. It’s certain that I won’t be able to escape, so you should quickly go...otherwise, it’ll be too late…”</p>
 <p>Hexi didn’t pay attention to his words. Rather, she rapidly took out her Silver Needles and in a flash sealed several of his major acupuncture points.</p>
 <p>As his acupuncture points were sealed, the spiritual energy and power that leaked from Zhou Yan’an’s damaged meridians slowly stopped, and his pale complexion began to return to normal.</p>
 <p>Not waiting for Zhou Yan’an to say anything further, Hexi quickly fished out a few spiritual supplement pills and stuffed it into his mouth, before indifferently saying, “It’s only a small injury, why should you make out as if you were half dead? Rest assured, you and I won’t die!”</p>
 <p>Slowly he felt spiritual energy gathering in his dantian, and even his meridians which had previously been burning gradually started to cool down.</p>
 <p>Zhou Yan’an was astonished, and as he looked at Hexi, his gaze steadily became more respectful. Yet when he saw Feng Lian Ying’s dark expression as she walked towards them carrying her sword, he couldn’t help but become anxious. “Young Master Xi, even if you were able to save this humble one’s life, with just our strength alone, we’re simply not able to be a match with Ice Lotus Fairy. I’ll only drag you down…”</p>
 <p>Zhou Yan’an’s words hadn’t yet finished, when he suddenly felt his throat clog and he could no longer utter any sound.</p>
 <p>Hexi coldly withdrew her finger that had been pressing on his voice acupuncture point, and indifferently said, “You’re too noisy, go to the side and obediently watch. Who said that we weren’t a match with that damned woman and could only die? Even if I really have to die, I must shed a layer of that vicious white lotus’s skin! In this world, no one can injure my, Xi Yue’s people, without paying the price!”</p>
 <p>Feng Lian Ying’s eyes were still dark; as if they contained venom. Yet hearing this just as she was starting to calm down caused her to burst into a fit of loud laughter, “Who do you think you are? You’re merely Foundation Establishment stage trash! You think that since you received Zijin Palace’s Inheritance that you’ll be able to go against me? In your dreams!”</p>
 <p>Once that was said, Feng Lian Ying’s expression became extremely dark and sinister. “If you hand over the Golden Bodhi Tree and Zijin Palace now, this Fairy will kindly leave your corpse intact. Otherwise, don’t blame me for being merciless. My Liu Li sect has so many methods to torture people, and at that time, I’ll let you have a taste of what it means to live in agony yet be unable to die! By then, even if you beg for forgiveness, it will certainly be too late!”</p>
 <p>Hexi sneered, then took a confident step forward before indifferently saying, “If you want me to hand over the Golden Bodhi Tree and Zijin Palace, I can! That’s as long as you, Feng Lian Ying, kneel on the ground and kowtow towards me, shopkeeper Zhou, and my spirit pets to apologise. Furthermore, admit to the people in this world that you, Ice Lotus Fairy, are nothing but a reputation with no substance; a woman with a venomous heart. Then, I’ll give the Inheritance to you, how is it?”</p>
 <p>“You!! You bastard, you court death!!”</p>
 <p>Once she heard that, Feng Lian Ying flew into a rage. With a blazing flame springing up around her entire body, the Long Sword in her hand formed out countless Sword-lights[1] that shot straight towards Hexi.</p>
 <p>Hexi immediately threw Dandan and the little Golden Dragon into her space, and seeing the Sword-lights flying towards her, she abruptly brandished the White Bone Whip in her hand.</p>
 <p>The White Bone Whip transformed into a whip with layer upon layer of shadow, and mixing with a murderous aura that was as cold as ice, it then enveloped the Sword-lights into a ball.</p>
 <p>With the movement of Hexi’s feet blurring into shadow, she disappeared from where she was currently standing in the blink of an eye.</p>
 <p>Hexi’s ice spiritual power was of course unable to resist a fire attack by a Gold Core stage martial artist. So the icy cold energy was rapidly engulfed by the flames, turning it into steam before it disappeared without a trace.</p>
 <p>But within this split second gap, Hexi had also disappeared. This resulted in the Long Sword hurtling past and returning to Feng Lian Ying’s hand without success once again.</p>
