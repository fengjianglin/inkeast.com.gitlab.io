 <p><strong>Chapter 324 - I Believe In You</strong></p>
 <p>“Or, will you kill your Uncle for your selfishness?”</p>
 <p>Gu Liufeng closed his eyes, and when they opened again, they were calm and tranquil. “I’ve made my decision.”</p>
 <p>Nie Jinchen laughed and said, “Since you’ve thought about it, why don’t you hurry up and kowtow to Little Sister Lian Ying, acknowledging your mistake…”</p>
 <p>However, before Nie Jinchen could finish speaking, Gu Liufeng had already stood up. Then, looking straight at Hexi, he slowly said, “Please, cure my Uncle!”</p>
 <p>Hexi raised an eyebrow, and a glint of surprise flashed in her eyes. “Have you properly considered everything? I don’t have a doctor’s rank, and I’m not a member of the Doctors Association.”</p>
 <p>Without the slightest hesitation, Gu Liufeng responded, “I believe in you!”</p>
 <p>Looking at this scene, Nie Jinchen’s words of humiliation and ridicule seemed to be stuck in his throat. His entire face was flushed red, and it was a long while before he exclaimed, “Gu Liufeng, are you insane?! You actually believe that lying stinky brat who doesn’t have any achievements?! After you cause your Uncle’s death, you’ll regret this decision!”</p>
 <p>The faces’ of the other people in the medicinal field were all showing their disapproval, and they gazed at Gu Liufeng like they were looking at an idiot.</p>
 <p>This man would rather reject Ice Lotus Fairy, a fifth rank doctor, and instead chose to believe a boy only on Foundation Establishment stage.</p>
 <p>Seeing the resolute gaze of Gu Liufeng, a corner of Hexi’s mouth lifted into a slight smirk. “In that case, then I need you go into the medicinal field to pick up some herbs such as Purple Monkey Flower, Pomegranate Fire Fruit, and Dragon Grass!”</p>
 <p>As soon as she said this, everyone was in an uproar.</p>
 <p>“My god, did I just hear it correctly? Did he just say to pick herbs from the medicinal field? Doesn’t he know those herbs are poisonous and that whoever eats them will die?”</p>
 <p>“This is what saving people looks like? It’s clearly wanting to kill people!”</p>
 <p>“Not to mention, the herbs he just named are the same ones as Ice Lotus Fairy. This clearly means that he doesn’t understand anything! He’s just copying the diagnosis and prescription of Ice Lotus Fairy.”</p>
 <p>“This guy is just too shameless!”</p>
 <p>The surrounding was filled with noise, yet Hexi’s expression didn’t change in the slightest; she merely watched Gu Liufeng with a relaxed gaze.</p>
 <p>Gu Liufeng looked at his Uncle who was now unconscious yet still groaning, and clenched his teeth as he said, “Okay, I’ll go!”</p>
 <p>“Insane! This guy must be insane!”</p>
 <p>“Entering the medicinal field is equal to courting death! Did that beautiful boy deceive him? How could he make such a decision??”</p>
 <p>“I know about the one who wears the mask; he’s the Boss of Sheng De Hall, Young Master Gu. With his shrewd intelligence, how could he unequivocally believe the boy’s words yet not believe in Ice Lotus Fairy to help?”</p>
 <p>“Perhaps he was seduced by the boy’s pretty face, so he doesn’t even care about his Uncle’s safety. Hahaha…”</p>
 <p>Gu Liufeng angrily grit his teeth, and in a flash, he entered the medicinal field.</p>
 <p>He was a person who ran a pharmacy, so even though some herbs such as Purple Monkey Flower, Pomegranate Fire Fruit, and Dragon Grass were uncommon; he could still recognise them easily.</p>
 <p>Soon, he had used jade boxes to hold a lot of these three kinds of herbs and brought them in front of Hexi.</p>
 <p>When he came out of the medicinal field, Gu Liufeng’s forehead was covered in fine layer of sweat, but his gaze was extremely resolute.</p>
 <p>At this time, Feng Lian Ying’s concerned voice was heard from afar. “Young Master Gu, since you entered the medicinal field, it’s very likely that you’ve already been infected with the Intoxicated Blood poison. You should quickly take one of my Five Elements Blood Coagulation pills! I don’t want you to kowtow and admit your mistake; I just hope that you and your Uncle stay alive... After all, we’re doctors; we must have benevolent hearts and be charitable in deeds. How could I act like Young Master Xi, and treat a patient’s life as a trifling matter in order to show off?”</p>
