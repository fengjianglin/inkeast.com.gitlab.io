 <p><strong>Chapter 97 - Spiritual Kitchen Expert</strong></p>
 <p>Unsealing her dantian to enhance her strength was her top priority at the moment. Unfortunately, it just so happens that besides Nangong Yu, there was no other person she could think of to help her.</p>
 <p>Heard the commotion outside, Wet Nurse Chen rushed to greet her Young Miss, yet was shocked upon seeing Nangong Yu sticking very closely to Hexi.</p>
 <p>A strong and noble aura could be felt from Nangong yu’s body, while his face was so handsome that it could stun and dazzle a woman. It was simply too oppressive!</p>
 <p>“Mi-Young...Young Master, you've returned?” Wet Nurse Chen cautiously watched Nangong Yu, still struggling to catch her breath as she asked, “And this person is…?”</p>
 <p>Hexi glanced at Nangong Yu and saw his indifferent expression. With his ice cold eyes, it was like he was an immortal, looking at ordinary people as if they were ants. His aura was one that was so imposing that it deterred people from coming close, and compared to his appearance when he was in front of her, it was like there was two different people.</p>
 <p>When Nangong Yu was like this, it more resembled the legendary King of Hell who was known to be cold hearted, cruel, and capable of killing without remorse, right?</p>
 <p>“This is...Young Master Yu, and his subordinate, Bai Hu.” Hexi's face was taut as she introduced them, reluctantly adding, “My circumstances nowadays is thanks to their help.”</p>
 <p>Wet Nurse Chen uttered a shocked exclamation, and suddenly her expression as she looked at Nangong Yu and Bai Hu was full of gratefulness and admiration.</p>
 <p>Hexi had purposely spoken vaguely, letting Wet Nurse Chan mistakenly believe that Hexi was able to escape from Gluttonous House, and to now also be able to have such strong skills, due to Nangong Yu. This was her Miss’s saviour!</p>
 <p>Suddenly, her instinctual fear of Nangong Yu was forgotten as she politely invited the two guests to enter the house. Even Hexi was thrown to the back of her mind.</p>
 <p>“Young Master Yu, since you've come all this way to this small and remote courtyard, then it would be better if you could stay and have a meal. We don’t have much, but I can assure you that we have the most delicious spiritual foods in the entire Jin Ling city here! Young Master Yu, you must taste it!”</p>
 <p>Following behind Nangong Yu, Bai Hu finally couldn’t help but laugh, “The most delicious spiritual food, hehe, which type of most delicious food in this Jin Ling city hasn't my master yet tasted? Wet Nurse, isn't your boast a little too big?”</p>
 <p>Especially looking around at this small shabby courtyard where there is no spiritual power fluctuations. This courtyard also didn't have a protection spell, how could they have enough crystal stones to build an expensive spiritual kitchen?</p>
 <p>When Wet Nurse Chen heard this she didn't feel the slightest bit humiliated or angry, instead, she proudly turned her head to look at Hexi's cold face, then mysteriously said, “Young Master Yu and Young Master Bai Hu wouldn't know, but our family's Young Master is a spiritual kitchen expert. I even dare to say that the delicious food she can make can’t be matched by the top chef from the Intoxicated Immortal restaurant.”</p>
 <p>Bai Hu's face still showed ridicule as he didn't believe her in the slightest.</p>
 <p>However, Nangong Yu raised his brows in interest, and with a smirk, he looked over at Hexi, “Why didn't this King know that Xi Er also had this kind of skill?”</p>
 <p>Hexi’s expression didn't change as she lightly said, “Wet Nurse Chen only selfishly said nonsense, don’t believe it.”</p>
 <p>“How can it be nonsense!” Wet Nurse Chen said anxiously, “Mi-Young...Young Master, anyone in this courtyard who's eaten your cooking has highly praised it! If this old slave has lied, then let heaven's thunder strike me!”</p>
 <p>“If you say it like that, then I must definitely taste it.” Said Nangong Yu as he lightly smiled.</p>
 <p>In Hexi’s heart she really wanted to be able seal Wet Nurse Chen’s mouth, but without the chance she could only gnash her teeth and say, “We don’t have enough fresh ingredients in this courtyard, let's try it another day.”</p>
 <p>This wasn't a lie, because although the courtyard stored many foods, most of it was low rank spiritual beast meat used to prepare food for Xi Jia and the others. Xi Jia and the other’s bodies were way down on the cultivation line, so their food didn't require much spiritual energy at all, but if Nangong Yu were to consume this low rank spiritual beast’s meat, the effect would be the opposite of the desired result.</p>
