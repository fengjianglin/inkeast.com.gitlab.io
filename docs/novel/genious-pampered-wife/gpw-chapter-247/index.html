 <p><strong>Chapter 247 - Paying The Price</strong></p>
 <p>If Zhou Yan’an were to know that Hexi; who to his eyes had no chance of winning possessed five attributes of the heavenly spiritual roots, his jaw would probably drop in shock.</p>
 <p>Feng Lian Ying’s gaze was filled with contempt as she looked at Hexi. “Don’t think that just because you were a little smart and have a tad bit of skill that you can regard yourself as a genius. Compared to a real genius, you’re still far from that and remain as trash. Ever since this Fairy got this Ice Crystal Sword I’ve never let it touch blood, so today, the two of you can be the first. Consider it a privilege!”</p>
 <p>Finished speaking, Feng Lian Ying brandished the Ice Crystal sword in her hand. Following that, crackling sounds were heard that could make anyone’s teeth ache, and in the blink of an eye, it was as if even the air was frozen.</p>
 <p>Those shadows of Hexi’s dispersed into the air one by one; disappearing without a trace.</p>
 <p>Shortly afterwards, a figure who was running away was firmly frozen by a layer of ice and was completely unable to move; it was Hexi.</p>
 <p>Feng Lian Ying burst into laughter, quickly stepping forward. “I said before that I would certainly dismember your body. Brat, now you shall break apart with my capsule of ice!”</p>
 <p>Feng Lian Ying raised the Ice Crystal Sword, and fiercely threw it towards the frozen Hexi.</p>
 <p>However, before her sword could reach Hexi, the capsule of ice suddenly exploded with a bright red light.</p>
 <p>Feng Lian Ying was startled, but before she had time to react, she suddenly felt an acute pain in her abdomen. This caused her utter a miserable and mournful cry.</p>
 <p>At the same time she felt pain, her Ice Crystal Sword had stabbed into Hexi’s shoulder. The broken capsule of ice shattering into an icy powder that sprinkled the tops of their heads.</p>
 <p>Both of them had beautiful appearances and under the fall of glittering ice dust, they seemed both stunning and breathtaking.</p>
 <p>But Feng Lian Ying’s current expression was like she had met a ghost; terrified and filled with disbelief.</p>
 <p>The two of them were standing very close together. The dagger that had just been held in Hexi’s hand was now nestled in Feng Lian Ying’s abdomen; while Feng Lian Ying’s Ice Crystal Sword was deeply embedded into Hexi’s left shoulder.</p>
 <p><em>Why? Obviously he had been frozen, but how was he able to thaw the ice capsule?</em></p>
 <p>Cold energy from the Ice Crystal Sword slowly spread throughout Hexi’s wound, but before it could completely freeze the left side of her body, the corner of her mouth curled up into a meaningful smile. “Ice Lotus Fairy, it seems that I forgot to tell you; it isn’t only you who possesses a gift of dual attributes of the heavenly spiritual roots!”</p>
 <p>“Furthermore, you seem to have forgotten what I said before. If you injure my people, you must pay the price! Even if I’ll die, I will certainly make you pay a big price first!”</p>
 <p>“No! This is impossible!” Feng Lian Ying screamed as she fell backwards.</p>
 <p>As the two separated, a squelch could be heard as the dagger and sword were pulled out of the pair, causing fresh blood to pour from their wounds.</p>
 <p>Feng Lian Ying covered the wound on her abdomen with her hands, her face filled with shock, resentment, and defiance. “No! I don’t believe it! You’re just trash, a useless person! How could you and I have the same innate skill!”</p>
 <p>It was at this point that Feng Lian Ying finally realised that Hexi had deliberately been frozen by her. This was in order for her to draw closer to Hexi and loosen her guard while thinking that she was winning.</p>
 <p>Just before, Hexi had used her formidable water attribute cultivation method, so Feng Lian Ying had thought she was a martial artist with a single water attribute spiritual root. Hence, she had never thought that Hexi would be able to escape with only her left side being frozen; until Hexi broke free.</p>
 <p>Hexi reached out her hand to briefly press down on several of her acupuncture points, blocking the cold energy from spreading further. She then used her fire spiritual power to heat the cold energy corroding her meridians.</p>
 <p>Thus, her complexion became pale, and her body tottered on the verge of collapse due to the excessive use of spiritual power to halt the ice-cold energy invading her body.</p>
