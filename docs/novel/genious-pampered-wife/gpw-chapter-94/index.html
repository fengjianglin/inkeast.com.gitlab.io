 <p><strong>Chapter 94 - Magical Hands That Can Revive The Dying</strong></p>
 <p>While Xiao Li, Xi Jia, and the others were thinking about Hexi, she had at this time left the remote suburbs to come to the bustling Yan Jing city, arriving at General Ouyang’s Manor.</p>
 <p>This time Ouyang Haoxuan wasn't lying in the bed, but instead sitting in a rattan chair in the courtyard.</p>
 <p>It was now already the third time that Hexi had come to treat Ouyang Haoxuan, the thin Silver Needles penetrating into several of his acupuncture points.</p>
 <p>As Ouyang Zhixiong quickly stepped forward, he started transferring some of his spiritual power to his son’s body.</p>
 <p>The Silver Needles inserted into Ouyang Haoxuan’s body shook slightly, as if there was an invisible hand shaking them. Yet unlike with the previous times, this time was different as there was now no longer any thick black liquid seeping out.</p>
 <p>“Done.” Hexi lightly uttered, her face showing a satisfactory smile.</p>
 <p>The youth’s skin was as fine as white porcelain, almost transparent under the sunshine. When a shallow laugh sounded, the youth's whole person was surrounded by a faint golden light, the beauty stunning and dazzling people.</p>
 <p>As Ouyang Haoxuan reclined on the rattan chair he momentarily felt stunned, his heart feeling as if it was grabbed by something. With a ticklish, heavy pressure in his chest, his breathing started to unconsciously speed up.</p>
 <p>Ouyang Zhixiong was pleasantly surprised as he looked at Hexi, “Genius Doctor Xi, today we didn't see any poison seep out, does that mean that Haoxuan is already completely recovered?”</p>
 <p>Hexi nodded her head, and after returning the Silver Needles to her space, she then sat down beside Ouyang Haoxuan.</p>
 <p>Her voice was as ice cold as her jade-like slender fingers as they grabbed Ouyang Haoxuan’s wrist, gently pressing down on his veins.</p>
 <p>His wrist sensed the cool touch of those soft and slender fingers, more exquisite than mutton-fat white jade.</p>
 <p>Ouyang Haoxuan suddenly felt his whole body tense, and feeling like the hand on his wrist was actually pressed against his heart caused him to be unable to suppress the shudder that shook his body.</p>
 <p>Hexi glanced at him strangely before she then withdraw her hand, saying, “The poison in Young Master Ouyang’s body has been completely removed, his broken tendons repaired, and his dantian is now able to once again accumulate spiritual power. Unfortunately, due to the fact that Young Master’s body has been declining for more than a year, his body is now extremely weak. Not just his body though, his meridians are also very fragile, so Young Master Ouyang’s body needs some time to exercise and recover completely.”</p>
 <p>Ouyang Zhixiong nodded repeatedly, and looking at Ouyang Haoxuan reclining on the rattan chair, he could feel his eyes start to redden.</p>
 <p>His son had been lying on the bed for over a year, and with a pale complexion and an unshaven beard, the whole image he had portrayed was one of an abandoned beggar, completely dejected.</p>
 <p>Yet now, although Ouyang Haoxuan’s body was still weak, he had regained his refined and proud demeanour, and with his eyes clear, his whole person now resembled a brilliant pearl. It seemed that compared to his previous disposition, the him of today was far more imposing.</p>
 <p>This is all thanks to Xi Yue, the Genius Doctor Xi with the magical hands capable of reviving a dying person with a miraculous method!</p>
 <p>Ouyang Zhixiong repeatedly thanked her, and ordering his people to carry out a large chest of crystal stones, he insisted that Hexi accept it.</p>
 <p>Hexi was raising a small pet that loved to eat crystal stones, so of course she was extremely short on funds. Since General Ouyang was so enthusiastic to give them, she certainly wouldn't argue with him and refuse.</p>
 <p>Yet it was now only proper to return politeness for politeness, so Hexi treated Ouyang Haoxuan’s body extra carefully. Not only did she leave a lot medical pills for Ouyang Haoxuan to take to restore his meridians, she also wrote out a detailed recuperation program to help return him to peak physical condition.</p>
 <p>Of course, those medical pills were something she had learnt to make in her previous life using a refining method unknown in Mi Luo continent. After all, she couldn't use spiritual power, so of course she wouldn't be able to refine pills by controlling fire.</p>
 <p>Ouyang Zhixiong's mind was finally at peace after Hexi had accepted the remuneration, but he couldn’t help but think that the black poison had almost completely eroded his son’s body, making it near impossible for him to ever fully recover.</p>
