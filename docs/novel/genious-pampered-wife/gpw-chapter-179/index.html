 <p><strong>Chapter 179 - Compensation</strong></p>
 <p>Hexi’s mouth twitched as she said, “Who says I will become your Princess sooner or later?”</p>
 <p>Nangong Yu raised his eyebrows. “You don’t want to?”</p>
 <p>Hexi glared at him. “We've barely known each other for a month…”</p>
 <p>“Right, we've known each other for a month, but we’ve embraced, as well as kissed. Xi Er, we already have such a close relationship, yet you have the heart to say that we’re only strangers?”</p>
 <p>Hexi’s forehead filled with black lines. <em>What is he talking about, embracing and kissing? Clearly I was being forced!</em></p>
 <p>Nangong Yu leaned closer to her ear and asked, “Xi Er, are you unwilling to become my Princess, to become my legitimate wife?”</p>
 <p>The man’s warm breath fanned against her ear, and with his exquisite face so close to her, Hexi could feel her heart jumping in her chest and her face slightly blushing. “This isn’t a problem of being unwilling or not…”</p>
 <p>Nangong Yu immediately beamed with joy. “Ooh, then it means you want to? Since Xi Er is willing, then the rest isn’t a problem, I'm very happy that we agree.”</p>
 <p>“Who’s agreeing with your opinion?!” Hexi’s long shapely brows frowned due to her anger.</p>
 <p><em>Since when did this man become a scoundrel! Clearly the first time she met him he had the manner of a ruthless and handsome tyrant!</em></p>
 <p>Nangong Yu swiftly switched positions, moving closer to where Hexi was sitting. He then gently placed his hands on her slender waist. “Alright, my Princess, now can you accompany me to eat? You see, I've had your dishes specially lined up for you, yet you haven't touched any at all. Are you ignoring me?”</p>
 <p>When the watching servants saw their Master’s completely peaceful countenance, totally opposite to his usual behaviour, their eyes widened till they nearly popped out. They gazed at Hexi like they were seeing a rare creature.</p>
 <p>Princess indeed is the Princess! They had never seen their Master pamper and act so lovingly to anyone like this before.</p>
 <p>Hexi could feel herself being watched by the servants, causing her ears to turn red. Casting an angry glare at Nangong Yu, she said, “Get your hands off!”</p>
 <p>“No,” Nangong Yu replied, like it was only to be expected that he could touch Hexi. “Princess and I will be eating like this in the future. We have no need for you to serve us, you can all withdraw for now.”</p>
 <p>The servants heard the order and promptly complied. With them hurriedly retreating, soon, only Hexi and Nangong Yu were left in the room.</p>
 <p>Nangong Yu said, “This way, no one will disturb us. Xi Er, you don’t need to be shy anymore.”</p>
 <p><em>Who is shy! You’re shy, your whole family is shy!</em></p>
 <p>Hexi was fuming, she really wanted to kick this shameless man.</p>
 <p>Nangong Yu immediately changed his tone to one of grief. “Xi Er, we clearly came to an agreement yesterday, and I wanted to see you as soon as I opened my eyes. I've been waiting for you since early this morning, shouldn’t you compensate me?”</p>
 <p>Hexi recalled that scene from before she left yesterday, and she couldn't help but blush. “Who told you to wake up so early? Don’t tell me that because you might wake up in the middle of the night, I also have to keep watch over you at all times?”</p>
 <p>“That’s a good idea,” Nangong Yu’s eyes lit up. “Indeed, you're my Princess, living in this manor with me is only proper. Someone come…”</p>
 <p>Hexi anxiously covered his mouth. “What are you doing?”</p>
 <p>Nangong Yu grabbed her small hand, and holding it in his palm, he innocently said, “Ordering my people to arrange a room for you. Ahh, arranging one beside my bedroom would be good, or perhaps...you would prefer to share the same bed with me, Xi Er? That’s exactly what this King has been waiting for!”</p>
 <p>Hexi noticed that he was becoming more and more outrageous, and quickly interrupted him. “Enough! What crazy things are you thinking about so early in the morning?! Hurry up and let me go!”</p>
 <p>Nangong Yu not only didn't let her go, instead, he encircled her waist with his arms, tugging her closer to him. “I can let go, but I've been waiting since early this morning. So Xi Er, you must compensate me.”</p>
