 <p><strong>Chapter 66 - Scars Remain For A Lifetime</strong></p>
 <p>Zhu Que’s heart was filled with hate, but remembering her Master’s imprint, she only glanced at Hexi with gloomy and cold eyes, before flinging her sleeves and leaving.</p>
 <p>It wasn't until Zhu Que’s figure and scent had completely disappeared from the room, that Hexi finally couldn’t bear it any longer, vomiting out a mouthful of blood. Her already pale face lost even more colour, becoming paler.</p>
 <p>She hadn't expected that a martial artist of Gold Core stage only needed to casually move their hands, and they would be able to injure her to such a degree.</p>
 <p>She really was too weak!</p>
 <p>***</p>
 <p>Hexi endured the pain all over her body and entered her space. The existence of her space and the real world was like a mirror, it's the reason why when she eats in her space, she wouldn't be hungry in reality.</p>
 <p>Therefore, when her consciousness entered her space, she was still wearing a thin bloodstained nightdress, her complexion unsightly due to the heavy injury.</p>
 <p>The rich spiritual energy in her space fused into her body, soothing the pain Hexi felt, helping her to relax a lot.</p>
 <p>Although Dan Dan was in the Xumi Palace, it was still able to know all that happened in the space, so when Hexi returned injured, it suddenly started crying loudly, “Mother, are you in pain? Does it hurt? Dan Dan is useless, I can’t do anything to help mother.”</p>
 <p>Hexi’s face held a helpless expression, yet her heart was somewhat touched, “Good Dan Dan, wait until you can come out, then you can help mother!”</p>
 <p>“Um, when Dan Dan comes out, I will help mother beat that bad person! Whoever dares to bully mother, Dan Dan will make him humiliated!”</p>
 <p>It's soft and immature child voice was full of anger and hatred. So much so, that Hexi was able to imagine a child with its small fists tightly clenched and pouting cheeks, swearing an oath with an adorably angry appearance. The depressed feeling in her heart suddenly lessened.</p>
 <p>She arrived at the edge of the Ninth Secluded Spirit Spring, drinking some of the spring water. The burning pain in her meridians disappeared in a flash, like cooling water across a burn, making her sigh in comfort.</p>
 <p>When she recalled that Zhu Que had looked at her with disgust, as if she had been watching an ant, on top of her insulting words and actions, it made Hexi’s eyes glint with a sharp trace of killing intent.</p>
 <p>Zhu Que was it? Very good! This debt, I will remember this. Inevitably, there will be a day where I will pay it back.</p>
 <p>As for that small wound on Zhu Que’s face, Hexi sneered while touching her own cheek. That can remain as her having received an advanced payment.</p>
 <p>In Zhu Que’s eyes, she was nothing but an ordinary person. Her face having received such a small wound was already enough to insult her, so she simply didn't care about it.</p>
 <p>However, what Zhu Que didn't know, was that Hexi was known as “Bai Wuchang[1]”, the double poisonous doctor. In her previous life, her opponents had been afraid to come within ten meters of her, and that is because anytime, anywhere, there would always be extremely poisonous and incurable poisons in her hands.</p>
 <p>And Zhu Que, if she discovered that the scars were unusual earlier, perhaps there would still be time to use spiritual power to tend to the poison, but if it’s too late...hehe, she should be prepared to live with the scars for a lifetime!</p>
 <p>Although she was already very tired, Hexi still took out the spiritual plants she had bought today, proceeding to concoct all kinds of poisons.</p>
 <p>There was anaesthesia, Blood Sealing Throat poison, and a large assortment of poisons that could either injure or kill a person. There were also poisons that could cause a person to be in so much pain, they would want to die...the confrontation with Zhu Que had made Hexi profoundly understand, that in this world, it was those with power that had the upper hand.</p>
 <p>Before she was able to remove the seal on her dantian, she must have strategies in place to defend herself.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, in her mind, there flashed an image of Nangong Yu’s handsome and outstanding appearance, his eyes luminous as they gazed towards her. Hexi narrowed her eyes, quickly dispersing this visual from her mind.</p>
 <p>Once all the poisons were concocted properly, Hexi released a relieved breath.</p>
 <p>Just as she was about to exit her space, she suddenly touched the bottle of medicine in the pocket of her nightdress. Opening the bottle's lid, a strong and pure medicinal fragrance permeated the air. What Zhu Que had said was right, this is indeed a good medicine.</p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p>[1]Hei Wuchang always bring disaster, while Bai Wuchang, although also scary and feared, is believed to sometimes bring wealth too. Wuchang means changeable and unpredictable. Understandably, it would be terrible to have to deal with someone or something that’s devoid of constancy and reliability. The Heibai Wuchang, literally "Black and White Impermanence", are two deities in Chinese folk religion in charge of escorting the spirits of the dead to the Underworld. As their names suggest, they are dressed in black and white respectively. They are the subordinates of Yama, the ruler of the Underworld in Chinese mythology, alongside the Ox-Headed and Horse-Faced Hell Guards. They are worshipped as fortune deities in Chinese temples in some countries. In some instances, the Heibai Wuchang are represented as a single being – instead of two separate beings – known as the Wuchang Gui, literally "Ghost of Impermanence". Depending on the person it encounters, the Wuchang Gui can appear as either a fortune deity who rewards the person for doing good deeds, or a malevolent deity who punishes the person for committing evil.</p>
