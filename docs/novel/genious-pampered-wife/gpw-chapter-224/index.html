 <p><strong>Chapter 224 - Conversation Between Spirit Pets</strong></p>
 <p>“You’re a bad guy! Don’t fake kindness, I already know you deceived Mother into accepting that something Inheritance, so now Mother is in pain. If Mother dies, I’ll bite you to death, whaa…”</p>
 <p>This little pink pig was without a doubt Dandan. He and Hexi’s life essences were connected; in Hexi’s space he saw all that Hexi experienced, and although he couldn’t feel what she was feeling, he still knew that something was wrong.</p>
 <p>He didn’t quite understand the meaning of Inheritance, but what he did know is that his Mother was now in pain, a lot of pain, and he didn’t want his Mother in pain.</p>
 <p>The little Golden Dragon gaped in shock, and glancing at the pale complexion of Hexi as she meditated next to him, he suddenly had a realisation and said, “You’re this little girl’s spirit pet? Ahhhhh, is her brain rotten? How could she accept such a useless little pig as her spirit pet?!”</p>
 <p>One must know, that once a martial artist accepts a spirit pet, he’s accepting them for a lifetime. The spirit pet and the martial artist’s life essence will then be strongly tied together. Because the contract between a martial artist and a spirit pet consumes a lot of life essence, a martial artist wouldn’t usually accept a useless animal as a spirit pet.</p>
 <p><em>He’s the majestic Golden Dragon, and now he’s unexpectedly become a spirit pet together with this little pig, this...this is too outrageous!</em></p>
 <p>“Dandan isn’t a little pig!” Dandan was so angry, that his both cheeks bulged. Then, after he pounced towards this hateful little dragon, he bit him on his tail! “Scoundrel, you better return my Mother, return my Mother now!”</p>
 <p>“Oww! Don’t bite, don’t bite!” The little Golden Dragon shouted and cried. He wanted to shake off this little pig, but since his tail was being bitten by him, he couldn’t even use his techniques and could only shout, “Your Mother has a great opportunity and if she can endure this trial, she can gain countess benefits! How are you not able to differentiate between good and bad, and instead, you prefer to question my good intentions?”</p>
 <p>Dandan finally released the little Golden Dragon’s tail, yet his expression was one of profound sadness rather than relief. “But I heard that handsome Big Brother say that if Mother doesn’t pass the trial, that she will die...whaa, Dandan doesn’t want Mother to die!”</p>
 <p>“Rest assured, your Mother is extremely powerful so she’ll definitely pass this trial. It isn’t that difficult, so don’t cry.”</p>
 <p>Dandan rubbed at his tears as he happily asked, “Really? Mother will really be okay?”</p>
 <p>“Of...of course,” The little Golden Dragon felt guilty and averted his eyes, then laughed out loud, “I’m your Mother’s newly accepted spirit pet. Since Master and spirit pet share both honour and disgrace, how could I deceive her?”</p>
 <p>Hearing that, Dandan immediately lit up with a happy smile, and he looked at the little Golden Dragon with a gaze brimming with kindness and adoration.</p>
 <p>The little Golden Dragon’s conscience felt heavier, and he kept his gaze averted. What he didn’t say, was that the agreement sealed between himself and Hexi was an equality contract, and that he had only urgently signed the contract with Hexi because she had the Abundant Dragon Ring. The Abundant Dragon Ring had been necessary for him to be able to untie the seal; allowing him to leave that sealed space.</p>
 <p>As long as he could leave that sealed space, he would be able to slowly gain his strength back. In the future when his strength surpassed Hexi’s, it wouldn’t be a difficult matter to undo the contract and dump her.</p>
 <p>And if Hexi died during their contracted time, the little Golden Dragon would naturally receive some damage, but it would only be a minor injury, with his cultivation base dropping a little. Later on, he could still find another person to sign a contract with him again.</p>
 <p>But seeing this adorable little pink pig’s worshipping expression before his eyes, the little Golden Dragon suddenly thought…that maybe becoming this little girl’s spirit pet wasn’t so bad. <em>Oh, how about I find a way that will allow her to pass the trial?</em></p>
 <p>The little Golden Dragon coughed, but just as he was about to speak, his expression abruptly changed slightly and he whispered, “Don’t speak, someone’s coming!”</p>
