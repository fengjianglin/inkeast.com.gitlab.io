 <p><strong>Chapter 10 – You Dead Fat Pig, Just Dream On For Your Entire Life</strong></p>
 <p>As it turns, out they weren’t at the main Zhu Manor, rather it was the Zhu Family’s other courtyard.</p>
 <p>This was where Zhu Zhongba’s personal courtyard was located. Usually he brought women from good families that he forcefully snatched, and where he lived a life of dissipation[1].</p>
 <p>Very quickly the cage was brought to Zhu Zhongba’s room. The little girl was carried out from the cage, and thrown onto the soft bed.</p>
 <p>Of course, her hands and feet were still tied by iron chains so there was no danger.</p>
 <p>“You all go out, no one is allowed to come in and bother me!”</p>
 <p>Zhu Zhongba waited until everyone had completely left the room, before a sordid smile spread across his face, and he climb onto the bed, “If it were not for you having a body of pure Yin, how could this young master touch an ugly person like you!”</p>
 <p>The was room lit using night pearls for illumination, specks of light softly landed on the little girl’s face.</p>
 <p>An oval face, long and shapely eyebrows, a beautiful small nose, and exquisite red lips. Slightly fluttering eyelashes rested against her cheek’s, and a fine chest that gently moved up and down with each breath.</p>
 <p>The dim light had weakened the little girl’s pale skin and the sallow, dark circles under her eyes, made her look delicate and beautiful.</p>
 <p>Unexpectedly, the dimly lit room could make her look like an exceptional beauty?</p>
 <p>Zhu Zhongba swallowed the saliva pooling in his mouth, his heart beating wildly like a drum, and all the blood in his body rushed forth to the lower part.</p>
 <p>“I didn’t pay much attention before, but she’s a little beauty!”</p>
 <p>With his saliva to starting to pool again, his fat paws reached out to grope the little girl’s chest, “Little beauty don’t worry, this young master will soon let you experience the taste of being in seventh heaven……Ah—-!!”</p>
 <p>Zhu Zhongba’s hands had not yet touched the little girl’s clothes when he was already flying in the air, landing heavily on the ground.</p>
 <p>This time being thrown had made him confused and dizzy, his mind buzzing.</p>
 <p>He Xi leisurely sat up on the bed, the thick iron chains scattered around her.</p>
 <p>Obviously, the iron chains couldn’t hold her.</p>
 <p>Zhu Zhongba’s shaking finger pointed at her, “You….how can you break free from the iron chains?”</p>
 <p>He Xi stepped forward, her face revealing a cold smile, “Young Master Zhu really isn’t clever, I broke free from the iron chains in the auction, so how could it be that I can’t break free a second time? You think changing the iron chains with thicker ones can keep me chained?”</p>
 <p>“You….don’t you come near me!”</p>
 <p>Zhu Zhongba used his hands and feet to crawl backwards. Suddenly remembering, he quickly pulled out the Slave Ownership Card. Holding it in his hand, he frantically poured his spiritual power into it.</p>
 <p>He Xi immediately held her head, a painful expression appeared on her face as she fell back on the bed.</p>
 <p>Zhu Zhongba’s heart calmed, he burst into loud laughter while struggling to get up from the ground, “I advise you that it would be a smart decision to obediently listen to this young master’s words, if you serve me properly you can suffer less!”</p>
 <p>Even if this woman went on a rampage again and was difficult to deal with, as long as he had the Slave Ownership Card in his hand, it didn’t matter. She had to be obedient, and move back and forth with every order he gave her.</p>
 <p>Moreover if this aloof and remote woman wasn’t afraid to approach him, bullying her would make him very comfortable!</p>
 <p>Zhu Zhongba’s eyes flashed with excitement, an excessively demonic appearance on his face. Holding the Slave Ownership Card while swaggering forward, he raised his chin, “You still haven’t quickly come over to undress this young master, if you provoke this young master again there will only be more suffering for you!”</p>
 <p>He Xi’s body had half curled up from pain and she was shivering slightly.</p>
 <p>When she heard Zhu Zhongba’s words she was silent for a long time. Slowly, she extended her hand to grab Zhu Zhongba’s neck.</p>
 <p>“So long as you listen obediently, this young master will not treat you unfairly!”</p>
 <p>“Is that right? You want me to be obedient!” He Xi suddenly lifted her head, her cold smile meeting Zhu Zhongba’s eyes, “You dead fat pig, just dream on for your entire life!”</p>
 <p>He Xi had barely finished speaking when she had already raised her foot, and ruthlessly kicked Zhu Zhongba to fly off his feet.</p>
