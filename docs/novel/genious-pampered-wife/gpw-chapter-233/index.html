 <p><strong>Chapter 233 - Regardless Of Life Or Death</strong></p>
 <p>Hexi’s gaze indifferently landed upon Feng Lian Ying. “Ice Lotus Fairy, I’ve already passed my part of the test. Since it seems that you’re reluctant to swallow the medicinal pill, does that mean you’re ready to forfeit the Inheritance?”</p>
 <p>“Why would I give up!” Feng Lian Ying shouted in a frail tone, her whole face flushing a deep red. “Anyway, it’s merely differentiating the antidote, that’s all! Do you think I’ll lose to you?!”</p>
 <p>With that, she poured out a pill from the red bottle. But just as she was going to stuff the pill into her mouth, there was distinct fear in her eyes.</p>
 <p>This was Dense Viper Orchid; once it was swallowed, the whole body would be covered with scales, becoming more ugly than a beast’s.</p>
 <p>Hexi saw that Feng Lian Ying was so scared that her face had turned white, so she couldn’t help but shake the empty red bottle held in her hand and leisurely say, “Ice Lotus Fairy, there’s no need for you to force yourself. If you don’t dare to swallow the pill, then you had better immediately admit defeat!”</p>
 <p>“Who said I don’t dare!” Feng Lian Ying felt her anger surge as she was taunted by Hexi, and without thinking, she swallowed the pill.</p>
 <p>A red line soon appeared on her fair arm; and like a line of death, it continually spread towards her heart.</p>
 <p>Feng Lian Ying’s eyes filled with horror, and even her movements of seeking the antidote by opening the white and blue striped bottles became frenzied. This caused the bottles to knock into each other and produce clanking sounds as she searched.</p>
 <p>As time passed and was about to run out, Feng Lian Ying still hadn’t found the antidote.</p>
 <p>“Arghh! I don’t want to become ugly!” Feng Lian Ying looked at the skin on the back of her hand, and finally unable to bear it any longer, she collapsed to the ground. “Save me! Zijin’s Master, save me!”</p>
 <p>However, Zijin’s Master had no intention of saving her, and with the same gentle smile on his face as before, he said, “All the tests need to be accomplished by the prospective new owner of the Inheritance. Regardless of life or death, it’s the responsibility of your own misfortune or good luck, so it’s unnecessary for me to save you!”</p>
 <p>Feng Lian Ying looked at Zijin’s Master, then looked at Hexi watching indifferently from the side. With a hateful look aimed at the two of them, she grit her teeth till they nearly broke.</p>
 <p>Eventually, while still clenching her teeth, she fished out a tiny silver-white jade bead that she had kept hidden on her body all this time. Firmly pinching it to crumbs, she then smeared it onto her eyelids.</p>
 <p>The next moment, Feng Lian Ying’s eyes shined brilliantly, and her weak Divine Sense suddenly increased.</p>
 <p>Looking once more at the black pills that she had previously poured out, her eyes soon lit up as she picked up one of them and quickly swallowed it.</p>
 <p>As soon as the antidote entered her body, the red line and dark patch on her hand disappeared without a trace in a flash. Her dantian that had already started burning quickly restored to its original state; the poison finally cured.</p>
 <p>Zijin’s Master laughed faintly, then stood up to say, “Congratulations to the both of you, you both pass the second test once again. However, again, the outcome isn’t decided on who will be able to receive the Inheritance, so we can only proceed to the third test to see the result.”</p>
 <p>When Hexi heard that, her expression was only indifference.</p>
 <p>Feng Lian Ying, on the other hand, tightly massaged her arms, her eyes lowered. During the test a moment ago, she had used the precious Bright Sense Bead that her Master had given her. Unfortunately, the Bright Sense Bead was a single-use only item. When it was used against an enemy, it could increase her Divine Sense to limitless possibilities; increasing her speed and five senses. It was a very formidable weapon that could save one’s life, but today, she had unexpectedly used it in such a place!</p>
 <p>Moreover, just because she was too late in detoxifying the poison, while most of the scales on her skin had disappeared, she now had a black mark remaining on her left arm. Feng Lian Ying had always been beautiful, yet now she had such an ugly mark on her flawless left wrist! How could she be willing to accept this!</p>
