 <p><strong>Chapter 332 - Disobedient And Unfilial </strong></p>
 <p>This youngster before them was only about fifteen to sixteen years old with a cultivation base at Foundation Establishment stage, but no one expected that his medical skills would be so formidable.</p>
 <p>The crowd was in a daze at first before they suddenly returned to their senses. Then, all of them suddenly rushed to her and kowtowed before her.</p>
 <p>“Godly doctor, a person as great as yourself would, of course, forgive such offences committed by us lowly people, right? Please save us!”</p>
 <p>“That’s right, that’s right! Saving our lives will be a most meritorious deed. Please be merciful and give us a cure!”</p>
 <p>Watching those shameless people now begging Hexi, Wu Yu waved his fan as he sneered, “My my, I wonder who was it that just finished insulting my Young Master Xi and said that he was a quack who would kill people?”</p>
 <p>“And who was it that said my Young Master wasn’t even worthy of carrying Ice Lotus Fairy’s shoes, and saying that they mustn’t let him leave the medicinal field alive?”</p>
 <p>“Now that you know that my Young Master is extremely skilled, you turn to him to seek help from him to save you! I wonder how many faces you all have?”</p>
 <p>Everyone was so ashamed, to the point that their faces’ were filled with resentment. Wu Yu’s words were obviously too relentless, making them all lose face.</p>
 <p>However, as they felt the poison within them flare up once more, their little lives flashed before their eyes. How could they still consider their reputations?</p>
 <p>They didn’t respond to Wu Yu’s words, and instead kept incessantly weeping for help with faces filled with snot and tears.</p>
 <p>At this time, a man covered in blood and on his last breaths suddenly crawled out from the crowd. He didn’t crawl towards Hexi as everyone else did, rather, he crawled to Gu Liufeng and tugged at his clothes as he hoarsely said, “Liufeng, you’re Murong Liufeng, right?!”</p>
 <p>Gu Liufeng looked down at him. Although the person before him was completely different, he recognised his identity at a glance - he was the head of the Murong family; Murong Zhangfeng.</p>
 <p>Gu Liufeng narrowed his eyes, and suddenly, a blade appeared in his hand, and he quickly cut off the corner of his clothes that was being pulled by Murong Zhangfeng. Then, he coldly asked, “Who are you? Do I know you?”</p>
 <p>“Don’t pretend! I heard all your conversations with Gu Yidao!” Although Murong Zhangfeng had tried to lower his voice as much as possible, his extreme anger still made his voice sharper. “You’re a disobedient and unfilial bastard. Obviously, you’re offspring of the Murong family, yet these past few years you’ve actually been colluding with strangers to attack Murong family’s medicinal hall!! You bastard, Murong Feng is your Father. The Murong family is also a place where you were born and raised, but you actually dare to bite the hand that feeds you! Don’t you fear retribution for what you’ve done?!!”</p>
 <p>Gu Liufeng’s face was covered with a mask, so the only things visible were his cold eyes and the slight smirk hanging on a corner of his mouth. “You people from the Murong family are devoid of consciences and unafraid of retribution for your bad deeds. So, why would I be afraid?”</p>
 <p>“You-! You-! You are indeed Murong Liufeng! You bastard!” Murong Zhangfeng was so enraged that he suddenly raised his voice and continuously bellowed, “You’re the same as that shameless Mother of yours, nothing but cruel and unscrupulous! We of the Murong family raised you for nothing!”</p>
 <p>Murong Zhangfeng’s curses were said in such rage that the speed of the poison in his body become faster because of his emotions, causing him acute pain that made his anger be quickly replaced by fear.</p>
 <p>He looked up and saw Gu Liufeng slightly lowering his head until he couldn’t see his expression. He was embarrassed and ashamed of cursing, so he quickly said, “I can overlook this these small matters. Now, quickly get me the antidote from that kid. When I return to the Murong family, I’ll ask for you to be dealt with leniently.”</p>
