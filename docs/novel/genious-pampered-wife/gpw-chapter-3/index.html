 <p><strong>Chapter 3 – Asura Stepped Out From Hell</strong></p>
 <p>Everyone was stunned, causing the room to be enveloped in a split second of silence.</p>
 <p>“Did....did she die?” Someone opened the cage and dragged her out to check if she was breathing.</p>
 <p>“Smelly girl, refusing our goodwill only to forfeit her life, really, what bad luck!” One of them ruthlessly kicked the little girl’s body, unhappily spitting out a mouthful of saliva, “What a pity that there was only this furnace today, it’s ruined I, your father’s, good mood!”</p>
 <p>Old Jiang squatted on the ground, reaching out, he touched the little girl’s smooth skin to measure the softness, “Even though she can no longer be used as a furnace like this, if we peel off this body’s soft skin, it’s good enough to make a human skin drum with....”</p>
 <p>As Old Jiang was speaking, his hand that had been stroking the little girl’s body, suddenly froze.</p>
 <p>His muddy eyes stared into a pair of pitch black phoenix eyes.</p>
 <p>“She....she didn’t die!” Someone exclaimed.</p>
 <p>The next moment, everyone heard a miserable howl from Old Jiang, “Ah Ah—-!! My hand! My hand—-!!”</p>
 <p>Old Jiang’s hand, that had originally been caressing the little girl, now hung limply below his elbow. It was so flexible that it seemed like there weren't any bones. In actuality.....all the bones in his hand were crushed!</p>
 <p>Freezing in shock, everyone stared at the partly clothed little girl as she slowly stood up.</p>
 <p>Just a moment ago she was a crying and weak slave, shivering in the cage. Now she was like an Asura, one that had stepped out of hell.</p>
 <p>The blood that was flowing down her forehead was similar to a red poppy in full bloom.</p>
 <p>Dark energy filled the air, while a cold, dense mist diffused inside the room. The people inside the room trembled in fear, the atmosphere was as if a Death God had waved down a scythe.</p>
 <p>“You....who are you?”</p>
 <p>The speaker barely finished asking when a cold blade suddenly flashed through the air. A ‘ka la’ sound was heard, and before everyone’s eyes there was a person with his neck cut, cutting off his breathing, his eyes wide open.</p>
 <p>“Don’t....don’t you come here—-!”</p>
 <p>“Quickly, summon Gluttonous House’s guards!”</p>
 <p>The room used to examine the auction products was in complete disarray. People were running away frantically, forgetting that they themselves were martial artists. Most were at least Qi Refiners of the first level. They had also forgotten that just a moment ago, she was a slave who had timidly trembled inside a cage, while they had bullied and humiliated her.</p>
 <p>However, is there anyone who can escape from the Death God’s scythe?</p>
 <p>No!</p>
 <p>A piercing cold wind swept past, and with not enough time to react, they suddenly felt an intense pain in their necks’. With the blink of an eye they all lost consciousness.</p>
 <p>Ten breaths, just a mere ten short breaths, and the room had noiselessly filled with dead people.</p>
 <p>The little girl’s bare feet stepped lightly amongst the dead bodies. With an icy expression and gloomy eyes she whispered, “You’re all a thousand years too early harm me as I, He Xi, live once more.”</p>
 <p>****</p>
 <p>Inside Yan Jing City there was a famous place called Gluttonous House. It was here there had been a weak and pitiful slave, who had been bullied and humiliated until she died. When she once again opened her eyes, she had already become the gold medal assassin of the 21st century – He Xi.</p>
 <p>The moment He Xi had crossed over she had gotten the former’s memories.</p>
 <p>Coincidentally the former owner of this body had also been named Nalan Hexi.</p>
 <p>However, the former’s life was very different from the current He Xi. Nalan Hexi was born in a kingdom that respected a person’s martial force and Cultivation Base, the Jin Ling Kingdom. Her father was a world famous doctor, but she was the trash crippled without a trace of spiritual root[1]. Not just cultivation techniques, she didn't even have any innate medical talent.</p>
 <p>Nalan Hexi’s birth mother had died not long after giving birth to her, leaving her to fend for herself. When she was still just a child, her step mother assigned her to live separately in a shabby courtyard, to perish on her own. The evil slaves in this seperate courtyard saw that she had no authority, no power, and that she was regarded as trash, thus they would endlessly bully her. They would deduct her food and clothes expenses for themselves, often abusing her as if she were inferior to a slave!</p>
 <p>But even after being treated like this, the people in the Nalan Family still wouldn’t let her off.</p>

 <p>[1] Spiritual Root (灵根 línggēn) – the root of life. Figuratively: the very foundation of one’s body and soul. Cultivation usually requires some minimum level of innate talent, so someone with bad luck or a poor bodily constitution may find it impossible to even take the first step. In some novels, the quality of a person’s Spiritual Root can be tested to determine if they have the talent needed to cultivate. Rare individuals may even have special Spiritual Roots which allow them to cultivate quickly or grant them other benefits.
