 <p><strong>Chapter 323 - Ridicule</strong></p>
 <p>However, he continuously kept shouting at Gu Liufeng, “Don’t come near me...live well, Liufeng, live well…”</p>
 <p>The inside of Gu Liufeng’s mask had long since become damp with tears. Regardless of everything, he still wanted to shake off Wu Yu and rush over to his Uncle.</p>
 <p>However, Hexi was faster than him and scattered a handful of white powder into the air.</p>
 <p>The white powder landed on Gu Yidao’s body, and soon, it was absorbed into his flesh. Though the wounds showed no change, Gu Yidao’s painful wailing silenced, and his body stopped twitching.</p>
 <p>Hexi looked at Gu Liufeng, and indifferently said, “This powder can only temporarily stop the poison from invading his heart, it won’t last long.”</p>
 <p>Gu Liufeng stared blankly at Hexi; then he suddenly fell to his knees. “Xi Yue, can you save him? As long as you save him, my life is yours!”</p>
 <p>Hexi’s expression was somewhat grave, and while her voice came out indifferently cold like normal, it had a slight calming effect. “Even if I can save him, my method of healing people is different compared to other doctors. Moreover, it’s extremely likely that your Uncle will suffer from a great amount of pain. Even then, do you still want me to save him?”</p>
 <p>But before Gu Liufeng could answer, a soft voice interrupted. “Young Master Gu, I hope you won’t take offence, but you can take one of my Five Elements Blood Coagulation Pills for your Uncle.”</p>
 <p>Gu Liufeng turned around and saw Feng Lian Ying looking back at him with a smile spread across her face.</p>
 <p>Feng Lian Ying’s expression was filled with arrogance as if she was enjoying watching other people’s misfortune. Slightly raising her chin, she said, “Previously, it was Young Master Gu who injured me, but it was only because Xi Yue bewitched you; I believe that it wasn’t intentional. As long as you’re willing to sincerity repent, I will naturally save your Uncle’s life. After all, saving a life is the noble thing to do, and on top of that, I don’t want to see you heartbroken. How does that sound?”</p>
 <p>Standing beside Feng Lian Ying, Nie Jinchen couldn’t help but laugh as he said, “Gu Liufeng, you can’t really think that everyone has Little Sister Lian Ying’s strength and will be capable of saving your Uncle’s life, right?”</p>
 <p>“Don’t make the wrong choice and cause harm to your Uncle; you’ll regret it all your life!”</p>
 <p>“If you have any self-consciousness left, then obediently come here and apologise by kowtowing to Little Sister Lian Ying. After that, we will kindly help you. How about it?”</p>
 <p>Feng Lian Ying glanced at Nie Jingchen, as if she was trying to censure him, then slowly said, “Maybe Young Master Xi really does have a way to cure people? Although he’s just on Foundation Establishment stage and doesn’t have a doctor’s rank…”</p>
 <p>Nie Jinchen burst into laughter and said, “As if that waste has a way to cure people; he’s just talking rubbish! Now that he sees that you, Little Sister Lian Ying, have the limelight, he’s unsatisfied. There’s no need for you to defend such a vicious person!!”</p>
 <p>“That’s right! How can trash that would be so daring as to deceive everyone be compared with Ice Lotus Fairy?!”</p>
 <p>“This Young Master, if you really want to save your Uncle, you’d better come and apologise to Ice Lotus Fairy!”</p>
 <p>“Really, all kinds of trash are daring to impersonate being a doctor nowadays! This kind of person is simply not even worthy of carrying Ice Lotus Fairy’s shoes.”</p>
 <p>One after another, comments were shouted through the medicinal field. Everyone was ridiculing Hexi for overestimating her capabilities.</p>
 <p>Hexi stopped Nangong Yu who was filled with rage and ready to teach them a lesson, and coldly laughed as she whispered in his ear.</p>
 <p>Nangong Yu stared blankly. Then, following that, he poked the tip of her nose and laughed with an indulging expression on his face.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Feng Lian Ying saw the interaction between the two of them, and her face twisted in fury. After a few deep breaths, she managed to restrain her rage, and said, “Young Master Gu, have you thought it over? In just a few minutes it’ll be too difficult to save your Uncle.”</p>
