 <p><strong>Chapter 152 - Remove Nangong Yu’s Clothes</strong></p>
 <p>The one who attacked her is the silent and stone-faced Wu Xin, who had quietly been standing to the side.</p>
 <p>The room’s door closed in front of her with a <em>bang</em>. No matter how much she pounded on the door to be let back into the room, no one opened the door for her.</p>
 <p>Hexi had readied all the herbs, and began to use the pot to boil them like traditional Chinese medicine. For a while she hesitated, then secretly added spiritual spring water from the Ninth Secluded Spirit Spring into the pot.</p>
 <p>She even placed the silver needles she used for medical purposes into the pot with the medicine, then left it all to boil together.</p>
 <p>After an hour, the traditional Chinese medicine had successfully boiled, and the entire room was filled with the strong smell of medicine.</p>
 <p>The smell of this medicine is different from the smell of medicines normally used in Mi Luo continent. There is no sense of spiritual power, nor an atmosphere of vegetation. On the contrary, it only carried a strong bitter smell.</p>
 <p>Looking at the big pot of dense, dark soup, Qing Long’s and the other’s expressions turned somewhat fearful.</p>
 <p>Bai Hu couldn’t help but murmur, “Princess, the...the thing in this pot, you won't give it to Master to drink, right?”</p>
 <p>If Master drank the thing in this pot, will he really be able to survive?</p>
 <p>Hexi ignored him and poured the boiled decoction of medicine into the tub. The tub had been filled with hot water, and after more thought, Hexi secretly added more spiritual spring water before giving a command, “Remove Nangong Yu’s clothes and place him in the tub.”</p>
 <p>Qing Long and others looked at each other in dismay. Ambiguous expressions on all of their faces’.</p>
 <p>From the beginning, Miss Nalan hadn't admitted that she is a Princess, continually denying an intimate relationship between herself and Master. How is it proper for an unmarried girl to see Master without any clothes?!</p>
 <p>What they didn't know though, was that once Hexi entered the role of medical practitioner, she will completely forget her identity and gender. Whether is it a man or woman, wearing clothes or naked, in her eyes they are all the same.</p>
 <p>Qing Long quickly put Nangong Yu into the tub, the black liquid rising up to cover Nangong Yu’s chest. The moment the medicine touched Nangong Yu’s body, it started to slightly boil.</p>
 <p>It was at this moment that Hexi’s expression became serious.</p>
 <p>In fact, she knew that it was a risk to use Yin Congeal Grass, as it is an extremely cold Yin plant. But the cold energy in Nangong Yu’s body is too strong, so if she were to purposely use all the herbs with a Yang property, switching his temperature from extreme cold to extreme heat, it would seriously damage his body. It would be like the injuries he gets from the Flame Cave. So although his Cold Poison would be temporarily cured, in the long run it'll be even more damaging to his meridians.</p>
 <p>Therefore, Hexi had come up with the idea of using Yin Congeal Grass as a guide, matching it with the other herbs to temporarily ease his illness.</p>
 <p>But Yin Congeal Grass is still an extremely cold Yin plant after all, so once it entered Nangong Yu’s body, mixing with his Cold Poison, it will immediately make Nangong Yu’s illness worse, even life threatening. The only way to help prevent this is if she uses her Silver Needles. Before the Yin Congeal Grass’s cold essence can enter his arteries, travelling to his heart, she would unblock every one of his major acupuncture points, giving the other ingredients in the medicine a chance to advance. With this, they would be able to have an effect, neutralising the Yin Congeal Grass.</p>
 <p>And so, during this process, no one was allowed to disturb her.</p>
 <p>Qing Long and the others quietly left, guarding the room from outside. Yet the always silent Wu Xin couldn’t help but frown, “This Miss Nalan, if I remember correctly she is a concubine’s daughter and was abandoned by the Nalan family. With a cowardly disposition, she wouldn't complain even though she was forced to suffer bullying and humiliation. On top of that, she didn't even have a cultivation base. How can her true appearance and the rumours about her be so different?”</p>
 <p>Before Qing Long could reply, Wu Yu clicked his tongue twice and laughed, “If this little girl is considered cowardly, then there are no brave women in this world. Someone sold her to Gluttonous House to be an auction product, but when she opened her eyes, she cleanly killed all the guests in the room. Master and I personally witnessed it with our own eyes.”</p>
