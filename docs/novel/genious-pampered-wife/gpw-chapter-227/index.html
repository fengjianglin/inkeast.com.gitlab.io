 <p><strong>Chapter 227 - The Pain Of Burning Heart And Forged Body</strong></p>
 <p>Although the flame wasn’t extinguished, the ice-blue coloured flame was obviously shrinking. It seemed to be dodging the light gold coloured flame as it cowered to the side and didn’t dare approach.</p>
 <p>Shock was written across Feng Lian Ying’s face, and following that, her gaze become twisted and rage filled as she stared at Hexi.</p>
 <p><em>Her Raging Blue Ice Flames were a fifth level spiritual fire; when it encountered common low level flames, it would swallow them whole. But this stinky boy’s spiritual fire not only didn’t become extinguished, it actually subdued her Raging Blue Ice Flames, how was this possible?!</em></p>
 <p><em>In the end, what was the level of his spiritual fire? And who was it that helped him to subdue such formidable spiritual fire?</em></p>
 <p><em>Don’t tell me...was it...Brother Yu?! That’s right, it was definitely Brother Yu! Without Brother Yu’s help, how could he, a boy of Qi Refining stage, have such opportunities and abilities?</em></p>
 <p>Thinking of this, an intense murderous desire surged forth in Feng Lian Ying’s heart, and she had an almost irrepressible urge to kill him on the spot.</p>
 <p>However at this moment, the Raging Blue Ice Flame in the furnace was accepted, and a wisp of grey smoke wafted out, launching into the space between Feng Lian Ying’s eyebrows.</p>
 <p>Feng Lian Ying inhaled a few deep breaths, and with great difficulty she was able to suppress the killing intent in her heart. Then, sitting cross-legged on the mat before her, she began to receive the test.</p>
 <p>Moments after entering the Inheritance void, Feng Lian Ying noticed Hexi sitting cross-legged a certain distance away.</p>
 <p>Currently, Hexi’s forehead was covered with beads of sweat, and her lips trembled slightly. As it was clear that she was withstanding a tremendous amount of pain, her once moist red lips had cracked and lost all colour.</p>
 <p>Like before in this void, the shadowy imprint of Zijin’s soul appeared, and informed her about receiving the test.</p>
 <p>Feng Lian Ying’s face was filled with confidence as she nodded, and soon, the image of Zijin’s soul imprint disappeared. At the same time, a portion of ice cold spiritual power wrapped up her entire body.</p>
 <p>In the next moment, Feng Lian Ying’s complexion changed greatly as she let out a blood-curdling screech.</p>
 <p>So...so painful! It felt like all the bones and meridians in her body were being ripped apart. This kind of pain absolutely wasn’t something that normal people could endure.</p>
 <p>Since childhood she, Feng Lian Ying, had had everything run smoothly and had always been hailed as a genius. Sought after by everyone, many people had attempted to gain her favour. With all this, how could she now bear this kind of pain?</p>
 <p><em>Could it be that that boy called Xi Yue, who was sitting opposite her, had also been enduring this kind of torment? How could this be possible?</em></p>
 <p><em>This type of pain; how could this be called a test, wasn’t this simply asking for a human life? She, a Gold Core stage martial artist was unable to endure it, let alone an insignificant Qi Refining stage martial artist; so how could that brat possibly survive? This loathsome youngster will certainly die in this Inheritance void.</em></p>
 <p>A corner of Feng Lian Ying’s mouth lifted into a wicked smile, and from her pocket she fished out a medicinal pill and stuffed it into her mouth.</p>
 <p>Soon, the pain all over her body faded away without a trace, and Feng Lian Ying’s face was full of pride as she lightly laughed, “Fortunately Master prepared this earlier. All I need to do is swallow this Spirit Powder Pill, and I won’t need to endure the pain of Burning Heart and Forged Body, allowing me to pass this test effortlessly.”</p>
 <p><em>As for this boy called Xi Yue, since he’s just a Qi Refining stage martial artist, how could he ever hope to survive? Seeing how much he’s suffering now, perhaps he won’t be able to endure it much longer. At that time, wouldn’t the Inheritance be hers?</em></p>
 <p>Feng Lian Ying sneered, then, closing her eyes and meditating, she effortlessly prepared to wait for the test to end.</p>
 <p>At the same time, Hexi was currently experiencing a hell-like boundless pain.</p>
 <p>Her every meridian, every joint, and even every drop of her blood; seemed to be burning and freezing all at once. On top of that, it felt like countless ants were biting her body, causing her so much agony that she wanted to scream and shout; as well as scratch her own flesh off little by little to ease the pain.</p>
 <p>However, despite her body being in such terrible pain, from the beginning, in her mind, there had constantly being a part of her that was clear-headed. This part was reminding her, was insisting for her, to become stronger!</p>
