 <p><strong>Chapter 240 - Dying </strong></p>
 <p>“How could I be afraid!” When the little Golden Dragon heard the last sentence, he stomped in anger as he scolded, “Who said I would ran away! I…I only wanted to deceive that shameful woman, that’s all… You’re merely a Gold Core stage martial artist, do you really think that I’m afraid of you!”</p>
 <p>Upon saying that, the little Golden Dragon leaped in front of Dandan and started to curse as he faced Feng Lian Ying, “You’re such a venomous hearted woman! I’m not saying your looks are ugly, but that your heart is so vicious, it’s no wonder that Zijin’s Master doesn’t give you the Inheritance. Take a look at my Master; in comparison to your looks, his are more beautiful than yours, and his ability is higher than yours. Which idiot would choose you, an ugly woman, over my Master instead?”</p>
 <p>Standing behind the little Golden Dragon, Dandan promptly joined in with, “Exactly, exactly, such an ugly woman! She can’t even compare to one of Mother’s fingertips. Cross-eyed, hooked nose, toady face, and ugly looks with a vicious heart! Be careful in the future; when you give birth to a son he won’t have a butthole, and after you die, you’ll go straight down to the eighteen levels of hell!”</p>
 <p>Since Dandan had still been inside his huge egg from the beginning, his knowledge was now incomplete. Each of his owners had had different personalities, so naturally he received all different kinds of information, including some things that were weird. Now that he was angry and worried, he spat out the most vulgar curse words that he had learnt.</p>
 <p>If Hexi was awake at this moment and could hear her cute and clumsy spirit pet cursing and shouting at people like a wife in the street, she would certainly be so shocked that her jaw would drop to the floor.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, when the little Golden Dragon heard those curses, he loudly cheered. Then, looking at Dandan as if he himself had taught him, he continued adding insults. “Little foolish pig, some of your phrases were wrong. This woman is so ugly that whoever marries her will have bad luck, so how would anyone be willing to marry her? Since no one will marry her, how could she give birth to a son without a butthole?”</p>
 <p>Feng Lian Ying was born noble; surrounded by people who flattered her, fawned upon her, and who were always trying to curry favour with her. From since she was a child up until now, she had never suffered such insults and abuse.</p>
 <p>At this moment, she only felt her Qi and blood boiling; her face clearly showing murderous intent. “Two lowly beasts actually dared to insult me so much…very good! Today, I’ll skin you both alive, slowly pull your tendons out one by one, and dismember your bodies piece by piece. You’ll then be reunited with your Master in the underworld!”</p>
 <p>As Feng Lian Ying’s words left her mouth, a fire ball condensed in her hand, before she then fiercely threw it towards them.</p>
 <p>In a flash, the fire ball transformed into several sharp arrows; all of them heading towards Hexi, Dandan, and the little Golden Dragon.</p>
 <p>“We can’t let her hurt Mother!” Dandan shouted loudly, immediately making his body swell large again to protect Hexi.</p>
 <p>The little Golden Dragon’s complexion paled. He was more knowledgeable than Dandan, and therefore he knew just how terrible one strike from a Gold Core martial artist was.</p>
 <p>However, when he looked at the foolish pig behind him; completely disregarding his own life, the little Golden Dragon clenched his teeth and the golden light surrounding his body suddenly exploded.</p>
 <p>“BOOM---” An earth-shattering noise was heard that caused Zijin Palace to shake, as if a major disaster had befallen them all.</p>
 <p>After the sound of the explosion quieted down, the little Golden Dragon fell to the ground and spat out a mouthful of blood as he slowly started to faint.</p>
 <p>At this moment, a large area of his dragon scales were burnt, the horns on top of his head were broken, and his entire body was covered with blood and ghastly wounds. The little amount of energy that he had previously managed to collect with great difficult after becoming unsealed, was now completely used up.</p>
 <p>Dandan started crying after seeing such a miserable appearance, and his body rapidly shrunk back to normal size as he went to the little Golden Dragon’s side. “Longlong, are you alright… whaaa…</p>
 <p>don’t die!”</p>
 <p>“Little foolish pig!” The little Golden Dragon spat out another mouthful of blood and foam, baring his teeth as he said, “Don’t you know who I am? How can...how can I die...so easily…”</p>
 <p>He was unable to finish what he was saying before he fainted, the golden light around his body fading without a trace.</p>
