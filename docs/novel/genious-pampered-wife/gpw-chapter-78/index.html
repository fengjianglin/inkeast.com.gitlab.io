 <p><strong>Chapter 78 - Not Enough Spiritual Power? Then I’ll Give You Mine!</strong></p>
 <p>“Mother, I'm all right!” Ouyang Haoxuan chuckled, his voice hoarse. This was the first time he had really laughed, he was brimming with incredible surprise and hope, “Mother, my hands, my feet...I feel them! So painful! Hahaha...I feel them!”</p>
 <p>He laughed and laughed, his tears falling down to mix with the blood on the corners of his mouth and the sweat collecting on his face, giving him a miserable yet sinister appearance.</p>
 <p>Who can understand the grief and despair of one who originally had boundless prospects as a star, yet could now only wait everyday to die as he laid on a bed. His hands and feet didn't feel like his own, he couldn't clench his hands, he couldn't stand on his feet, to live like this, wouldn’t it be better to die?</p>
 <p>But now, he could finally feel his hands and feet, after a lapse of a year and a half, he finally...finally could feel the existence of his four limbs again.</p>
 <p>Ouyang Haoxuan cried tears of joy, so what if it the cost was great pain? Compared to the despair and humiliation of before, the pain was insignificant.</p>
 <p>Madam Ouyang and Ouyang Zhixiong’s expressions suddenly changed and they wanted to rush over to the bed. Unfortunately, they could only tearfully endure it as they were afraid they would disturb Hexi’s movements.</p>
 <p>Hexi finally finished inserting all of the Silver Needles, feeling exhaustion throughout her body.</p>
 <p>However, the treatment had just began, the next part was the crucial point.</p>
 <p>She discovered that perhaps because the people in this world were all martial cultivators, their bodies could endure more. Resembling tempered and refined magical items, the internal energy running in their meridians was much stronger, so compared to her previous life, it was a hundred times more difficult, causing her internal energy to be greatly consumed.</p>
 <p>Ouyang Haoxuan’s body had been slowly consumed by poison for more than a year, causing him to become weak. Otherwise, even for her, being able to finish inserting the whole set of one hundred and eight Silver Needles would be a problem.</p>
 <p>Next, she had to force the poison out through the Silver Needles, but this was a very difficult process.</p>
 <p>“Xi Yue, you can try to use spiritual power.” A gentle and low voice suddenly sounded in her ears.</p>
 <p>Hexi startled, and turning her head, she saw Nangong Yu’s dazzlingly bright handsome face, making her heart unconsciously palpitate.</p>
 <p>“It’s impossible.” With difficulty, Hexi made up her mind, shaking her head, “I'm unable to transfer enough spiritual power.”</p>
 <p>It’s not that she hadn't thought of using this method, anyone would think of testing it out first.</p>
 <p>But if she wanted to hasten the expulsion of the poison, she needed to pour internal energy into the countless meridian branches. During this process, if she missed even one spot, the poison would instantly gather, causing Ouyang Haoxuan’s body to explode.</p>
 <p>Using spiritual power would of course be much simpler and more effective than using internal energy, but she simply couldn't store spiritual power. Depending only on the tiny bit she had to penetrate into his meridians and survive, how could it be enough?</p>
 <p>Still, Nangong Yu only raised a corner of his mouth, laughing slightly, “If I tell you try, I'll naturally ensure a way for your spiritual power to be sufficient.”</p>
 <p>Finished speaking, Hexi felt a wide palm press on her sleeve, and from the palm, a warmth was transmitted through her thin clothing to her skin, making her body quiver and stretch closer.</p>
 <p>Nangong Yu’s low laughter, deep and full of magnetism, reached her ears carrying clear delight.</p>
 <p>Hexi’s face darkened, and just when she was about to step away from him, she suddenly sensed refreshing spiritual power slowly infuse her body.</p>
 <p>The exhaustion in her body instantly disappeared without a trace, and even her originally dried up dantian began to stir.</p>
 <p>In a flash, Hexi realised Nangong Yu’s intentions. She only needed to continue the treatment, and if she didn't have enough spiritual power, he would replenish it.</p>
 <p>That sort of lofty and domineering attitude...</p>
 <p>Hexi’s face reddened, however, she no longer refused. Instead, she concentrated, removing a Silver Needle that was longer than a foot and slightly thicker than hair from her space.</p>
