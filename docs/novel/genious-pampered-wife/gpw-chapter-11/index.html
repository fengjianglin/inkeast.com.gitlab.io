 <p><strong>Chapter 11 – Rest Assured, I Will Not Kill You</strong></p>
 <p>“Ah—-!!” Zhu Zhongba screamed as he flew backwards, sounding like a pig being slaughtered.</p>
 <p>He frantically retreated, retrieving a whip he kept in his Storage Ring. Without any coordination or skill, he faced Hexi while still disoriented.</p>
 <p>Hexi was very nimble, she certainly wasn’t going to get an injury from the whip. However, from the top of the whip, a cold aura could be felt, rousing her interest.</p>
 <p>She dodged to the side, her action too fast to follow. Grabbing the whip, she faced the fat Zhu Zhongba as she firmly tugged on the whip several times.</p>
 <p>Zhu Zhongba screamed as the whip was tugged on repeatedly, scared witless, until finally his screaming voice was too hoarse to be heard.</p>
 <p>Hexi sneered at Zhu Zhongba’s sorry figure that was rolling on the ground, “Indeed, this is a good whip, it’s wasted being owned by you though.”</p>
 <p>If her guess was right it was made using a type of animal bone. Clear white, tough yet soft, and the barb on top of the whip could freely stretch. She had really picked up a treasure.</p>
 <p>On the other side, Zhu Zhongba’s miserable howling had finally attracted the guards from outside to come in.</p>
 <p>The first ones to arrive, sure enough, were those four Foundation Establishment stage guards. The corner of Hexi’s mouth lifted, in her hands there were already well prepared Invisible Needles. Suddenly, they flew from her hands towards the guards, like falling rain.</p>
 <p>“Ah—-! My spiritual power, why can’t I use my spiritual power?!”</p>
 <p>“You evil woman, what underhanded trick did you again use on us?”</p>
 <p>The martial artists from the entire courtyard had gathered to help. So the Invisible Needles had sealed not only the Dantian[1] of the four Foundation Establishment stage guards’, but also the Dantians of the large party of Qi Refining stage martial artists. Rendering them all unable to use their spiritual power.</p>
 <p>After that, Hexi’s hands slightly trembled and a faint fragrance permeated the air.</p>
 <p>Still feeling indignant at the injustice of losing their spiritual power, the guards suddenly felt themselves weaken. Powerless, they collapsed to the ground.</p>
 <p>At this moment, they couldn’t resist. They didn’t even have the ability to shout for help.</p>
 <p>Hexi picked up the Slave Ownership Card that had fallen to the ground, and put it in her space. Then, lightly stepping forward, the corner of her mouth curved into a sinister smile.</p>
 <p>Zhu Zhongba’s fat face looked like a pig head, swollen with purple bruises and criss crossed with red whip marks, his eyes extremely frightened, “Young lady, brave woman, I was wrong, I was wrong, please don’t kill me!!”</p>
 <p>Hexi squatted down, lightly patting the tragic sight of Zhu Zhongba’s fat pig face.</p>
 <p>“I had said you were a dead fat pig. If you had pain attention, why would you still not behave? My advantages, just because you want it, you think you can have it?”</p>
 <p>“I wouldn’t dare, wu wu wu, I wouldn’t dare anymore!”</p>
 <p>Hexi felt disgusted just looking at the weeping form of Zhu Zhongba, dripping mucus and tears everywhere, “Unfortunately it’s too late! You’ve already provoked me, and now want to escape unscathed just like that? Dream on!”</p>
 <p>Hexi, sick of the weeping Zhu Zhongba, kicked him until he fainted. Then she proceeded to drag over those four guards that seemed like dead pigs.</p>
 <p>“Didn’t you say you wanted me to taste the experience of wanting to die but being unable to?”</p>
 <p>The arrogance in the little girl’s smile was filled with demonic laughter, her cold eyes flashed with ruthlessness, making them terrified.</p>
 <p>“You….do you know who are we?” Among them, one guard that appeared fierce, but was actually cowardly at heart spoke, “We are people from Jin Ling Kingdom’s richest Zhu Family, if you touch Young Master Zhu and us, you will stand as an enemy of the Zhu Family.”</p>
 <p>“Pei! You’re not too difficult to deal with, you’re merely an ordinary person! If we had detected it a moment ago, we wouldn’t have been trapped by your evil trick! Zhu Family has countless martial artists, at that time a tiny individual with no power, like you, wouldn’t be able to step on us as you wish!”</p>
 <p>“You should just let us go, if not you will have to face the rest of us.”</p>
 <p>The four guards’ words were filled with threats, and implications, of despising an ordinary person like herself.</p>
 <p>Hexi laughed angrily. This group of incompetent slags, apart from relying on their martial artist identities to bully others, what else can they do?</p>
 <p>Her quiet voice that reached their ears was bitingly cold, like a whisper from hell, “Rest assured, I will not kill you.”</p>
