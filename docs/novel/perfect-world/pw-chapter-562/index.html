Then, black lightning curled up around their bodies and dao sounds rumbled, shaking the space here.&nbsp;</span></p>

He had been aware that these two were quite extraordinary. He stopped moving and said, “You two, is there something you want to say?”</span></p>

The powerful fluctuations were restrained, and they seemed to have calmed down as well. In addition, waves of auspicious radiance began to spread outwards.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All enlightenment and demonification could change in an instant.&nbsp;</span></p>

Their expressions shifted from peaceful, to confused and even to serious; their auras seemed to be continuously changing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How could that be? Only today did I realize that I am myself.” Coin Elder seemed to be in deep thought.</span></p>

He was finally going to find out these two’s background today. They weren’t simple after all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You should continue breaking records. We feel like a layer of fog that has clouded our spirits is about to be uncovered. We are gradually recalling some different things,” said Bird Grandpa. He showed a rare deadly earnest expression instead of the expression of an old swindler.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao nodded and advanced boldy. He continued to break records and press forward.&nbsp;</span></p>

Little Stone returned and created such commotion, leaving everyone shocked with his actions.</span></p>

What was going on? They felt like they were following two ancient vicious beasts and felt quite uneasy.&nbsp;</span></p>

It was as if a resplendent halo was shining behind his head, making him look like an immortal buddha.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Coin Grandpa was also transforming, his bones resonated with the dao and immortal winds blew about him. The sinister smile on his face had completely disappeared, and there was a bit of an otherworldly aura to him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone became stupefied as they watched. Weren’t these two swindling good-for-nothings? Wasn’t the change right now too crazy? They didn’t dare believe the two they were looking at were the shameless duo from before.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao arrived in an even higher region. Right now, his body was shining like an undying divine furnace. He had broken through many great records, which made him quite exhausted, so he decided to stop for a bit.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“As you break records again and again, we became more and more powerful. Some of our memories that had been buried in dust have been uncovered.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Shi Hao heard this, he looked at them with a pensive look. After he became human emperor, he had once sent people to investigate these two individuals, but he couldn’t find experts that matched these two.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You guys shouldn’t have been created by the Void God Realm’s natural laws right?” He asked, making this guess.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No, we are genuine flesh and blood people,” said Bird Grandpa. A great sun appeared behind him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao said, “Don’t tell me that you want me to break through all the records of the wasteland region and then keep on going to the other great regions. I don’t have that much time!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am feeling more and more clear minded and have understood a few things. You don’t need to do that much,” Coin Elder said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“To the final place!” Bird Grandpa said with an extremely serious expression.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The others here felt rather strange as well. The changes that were happening to these two elders was just too great, right? There was actually a bit of otherworldly aura, as if they didn’t belong to the world of mortals.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who exactly are you two?” Shi Hao asked. This was also what everyone else wanted to know.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We also want to know and are still trying to figure it out.” Bird Grandpa gave a hollow laugh.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Coin Elder immediately nodded as well. When this smile appeared, it seemed extremely devious again, shattering the immortal feeling he was giving off before, sending him back down into the world of mortals.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Along the way, they gradually returned to their previous appearance. The shameless duo returned, continuously peddling bone books to the people along the way and raking in the business.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only, from time to time when their eyes opened and closed, a strand of radiance would flash past, indicating that they were no longer the same as before.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Five thousand coins for this bone book. We ensure your satisfaction!”</span></p>

Look at the little Stone. He followed precisely what was on this training method to rise up. Youngsters, work hard. The next little Stone can be you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">......</span></p>

Their faces were lowly as they conned a large group of people. They were like two divine poles as they were surrounded from all sides.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What place is this?” Everyone was astonished. They had unwittingly arrived in a hazy light that flowed with pure white light that looked like immortal energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a pair of enormous bronze gates here that was large and majestic like an enormous mountain. In the past, no one knew that this type of mysterious place existed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Open!” Coin Elder pointed forward with his hand, and symbol light flickered about. The enormous ancient bronze gates rumbled open and surged with waves of chaotic energy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone backed up and shivered inwardly. There was actually the energy of primal chaos diffusing here. This place was definitely an important place.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The scenery behind the mountainous bronze gates was vast and boundless. The mist covering this place was extremely thick, making it hard to see anything clearly. Only after a long time had passed could one barely make out a road that stretched into the heavens.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a path made of bluestone. It was quite unusual, because it wasn’t laid on the mountain and instead floated into the void. It didn’t seem to possess weight, as if it was a string of blue-green clouds that led directly into the sky.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a heaven path, one that seemed to lead straight into heaven.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao looked up this path with his arms behind his back. His heart was not at peace at all. The Void God Realm actually had this type of place? He had never heard of it before.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We recalled a few things. No matter how much records you break, you still won’t obtain the final two pieces of bronze books. Only by fighting your way up this path would you be able to obtain them,” said Bird Grandpa.&nbsp;</span></p>

How can you say those words to this old one? I am so happy and excited to have been able to wait until this day where such an excellent youth like you can ascend this path.”</span></p>

What kind of path was this? They had never heard about it before. What kind of opponents would appear at the end of the road?</span></p>

This place was previously sealed up by a pair of large bronze gates and only appeared today. Who was this opponent? Could it be an existence that had lived from the ancient times until now?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao laughed. Right now, he truly didn’t fear what kind of powerful experts there was and wished for a good battle. He actually hoped that there was a great battle that could make him go all out.&nbsp;</span></p>

The white mists seemed to have scattered by his feet, revealing a simple and unadorned bluestone road.&nbsp;</span></p>

Shi Hao seemed to be walking in an unhurried manner without suffering any attacks, so they didn’t seem convinced.&nbsp;</span></p>

However, as soon as one person stepped on it, he was blasted backwards, causing him to stagger in retreat.&nbsp;</span></p>

Loud cries rang through the air.&nbsp;</span></p>
