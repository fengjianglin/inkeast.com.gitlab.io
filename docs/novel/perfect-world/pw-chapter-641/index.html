He found it hard to suppress his emotions. Originally, he was feeling incomparable sorrow and loneliness, but he never expected that he would actually meet his grandson alive!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During these past two years, he always carried a type of misery, but today, he reunited with his grandson, alive no less! It immediately swept away the haze covering his heart. This was the best ‘present’ he received in this life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Haha…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">” He couldn’t stop laughing. Tears slid down the side of his face. He felt incomparably carefree. “Who cares if you don’t have a supreme being bone anymore? You can still travel unhindered throughout the three thousand provinces and turn the higher realms upside down!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he said this, the surrounding people were all shocked. A single person lost his supreme being bone twice, surviving after both times. This was already enough to prove something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was definitely horrifying, a young supreme being who will inevitably shake up the higher realms. Whether or not he has an immortal bone might not be that important anymore.</span></p>

He would not be ordinary and will definitely shine with glory.&nbsp;</span></p>

Who among them didn’t feel uneasy?</span></p>

They refused to believe this. Many people knew about Shi Hao’s rumors. He clearly died in battle, so how could he have revived?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One has to understand that a year ago, they received concrete evidence that Shi Hao died under the curse. All of his bones were infected with the green rust symbols. He was powerless to defy this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, at the crucial point, he even pulled out his own supreme being bone and gave it to Qin Hao, leaving him even more powerless to deal with the curse. There should have been no way for him to survive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only Grandpa Fifteen believed that this was his own grandson. The more he looked at Shi Hao, the more convinced he became. He roared with laughter, tears sliding down his face the entire time. It was clear that this elder became happy to the extreme.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You eyes are just like how they were when you were younger, still so big and bright. Your eyebrows are the same as your grandfather’s, and your face is also similar. You are my grandson after all!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During all these years, he had always been praying to meet his grandson. From the moment he broke out from the Black Forest’s restricted land, the first thing he did was bring the divine pill back to Stone Capital.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he was disappointed again and again, feeling regret each and every time. In the end, he even heard of his grandson’s death. How great of a shock was thick?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were separated for more than ten years. The last time they met, Shi Hao was still little and inside swaddling clothes. Today, they reunited again, a young supreme being standing in front of him, making the elder feel satisfied down to the bottom of his heart. All of his gloominess disappeared.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Grandpa, there are so many wrinkles on your face now, and your hair turned white. I’ve made you suffer!” Shi Hao choked with emotions. He vowed that he would definitely use spiritual medicines to refine a furnace of precious pills for his grandfather, restoring him to his previous majestic appearance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He then touched Grandpa Fifteen’s arm, and then even more tears fell. “Grandpa, I have holy medicines that can help you recover. Your broken arm will grow again. Everything will be good again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Haha…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">” Grandpa Fifteen roared with laughter. He quickly wiped away his tears and said, “After meeting you again, all of grandpa’s injuries and illnesses are no problem. I will become as strong as a young fella again. Who am I? I am the Great Demonic God!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This type of confidence, this type of attitude was simply the same as Shi Hao’s. Even if no one else said too much, these two were definitely grandfather and grandson. They were of the same sort.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">En!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">” Shi Hao nodded fiercely. He was going to help his grandfather completely recover.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, his mind was shaken, and his face fell, because when he touched his grandfather’s back, he detected a terrifying injury. It was extremely large.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He suddenly arrived at his grandfather’s back, and after carefully inspecting that area, he released a cry of alarm, feeling incomparably anxious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This wound was created by a sharp weapon, extending from the back of his head all the way down to his back, almost hacking Grandpa Fifteen apart. His body was currently held together by his powerful cultivation, and that was why it didn’t fall apart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this type of wound was truly there, serious to a point where it couldn’t get any worse.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Grandpa!” Shi Hao shouted loudly. This was an injury that even cut open his head! Under normal circumstances, he shouldn’t be alive! Killing intent long erupted in Shi Hao’s mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as they met, he saw this scene. It was grievous news, leaving Shi Hao feeling fearful and draining his face of color. He quickly brought out the heaven and earth pouch, bringing out a half foot tall holy medicine that had crescent leaves and sparkling with purple radiance, having Grandpa Fifteen take it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t worry, grandpa has been surrounded by them many times already, but haven’t I still managed to survive just fine? This is even more not a problem.” Grandpa Fifteen looked extremely calm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But…” Shi Hao’s heart trembled. This wound was no joke! It was too serious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you didn’t come, did you think your grandpa would be killed by them? How could this group of idiots kill me?” Grandpa Fifteen was just as unyielding as before. He looked at the people in front of him with disdain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The eight experts were so angry their eyebrows stood vertically. After being pursued like this and long being seriously injured, he was actually still carrying this kind of attitude, daring to speak about them like this. It was impossible for them to endure.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao was speechless. From a certain standpoint, the grandfather and grandson really were alike. Even at such a crucial point, his grandfather still taunted and showed contempt towards this group of experts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Something like you who doesn’t know the difference between life and death, since you are both here, I’ll just get rid of you both in one go!” The purple-robed elder’s expression was malicious. He had silently adjusted himself for a bit, but with half his body blasted apart, even with his powerful divine abilities, he could only recover a bit of his foundation energy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, as experts that ignited their divine flames, it was enough to deal with these two supreme experts. Now that they were attacked once, they would definitely not tolerate a second.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for that old woman, a light green flame jumped about her body. The part of her right arm that was broken stopped bleeding, and her breastbone even more so already reconnected. Her face was covered in a dark shadow, and killing intent surged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I admit your talent which is astonishing, and your survival was truly a miracle. However, you shouldn't have appeared in front of our faces!” She sneered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So what if he was a young supreme being? He encountered experts like them before he grew up, so he still wasn’t their opponent. If he chose to fight them head on, then only death awaited him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ve killed six or seven trash like you two in the lower realm already. Two more isn’t that big of a deal.” Shi Hao’s voice was calm. Towards his grandfather, he would reveal true and sincere feelings, but against these people, he would only treat them coldly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Just the jokes of a youngster. You will pay for your recklessness! Even though you have talent, I am going to kill you first, not allowing you a path of life!” The old woman coldly said and rushed over.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since they met again and stood on opposing sides, how could they give him another chance to live?
