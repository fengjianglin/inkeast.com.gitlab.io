 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her white clothes were otherworldly, her beautiful black hair fluttering about and her large eyes intelligent. Her fine nose was tall, red lips moist. She looked like the reincarnation of the moon temple’s fairy, unspeakably pure and aloof.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am Qing Yi, an independent person. I will not leave with you all.” Qing Yi said. Her eyes were clear, peaceful and without fluctuations as she watched these two.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If she revealed her true appearance, she would be completely the same as the female on the other side.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was still an elder beside her, an expert from Goddess Academy. At this moment, this person was frowning, in deep thought.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This won’t do. Qing Yi is now my academy’s disciple. We cannot verify whether what you say is true, so you cannot bring her away.” The elder raised his head and said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Wu was also here, her yellow dress fluttering about. Her aura was powerful, and the area between her brows shone. “I only know that she is Qing Yi, and she does not want to go with you all. This is already enough. Please leave.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The reality is that she is Yue Chan’s second body. No matter what, we have to bring her away!” Immortal Palace’s inheritor said, his tone cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason why he did this was because he didn’t want the second body to defect, exposing the secret method of dividing the self, as well as its weakness. That would be unfavorable for him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This ancient method definitely couldn’t spread throughout the world.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was another point, and it was the main reason. He wanted to witness the process of Yue Chan’s body merging again so he could gain a bit of experience, become even stronger.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young one, this is my Goddess Academy, not the bronze palaces.” An elder spoke with a calm tone. However, an unquestionable pressure began to diffuse outwards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was because Qing Yi was the academy’s disciple. If the higher levels couldn’t even protect an exceptional disciple, how could they call themselves a glorious great sect that had towered since the ancient times, one that overlooked three thousand provinces?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior, she is me, I am her. I am just asking to truly become one now. Does your distinguished self have the heart to stop this?” Yue Chan’s main body spoke, her voice calm and expression sincere.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since you are me and I am you, why would I be against it? The strong makes things difficult for the weak. You are yourself. I am Qing Yi.” On this side, Qing Yi was quiet and calm, her appearance otherworldly. A green colored imprint shone between her brows, making her appear even more extraordinary.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The two of us only have a few small cracks. When we merge, everything will pass.” Yue Chan’s main body said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior, we really must bring this woman away. However, considering Goddess Academy’s feelings, we will offer compensation.” Immortal Palace’s inheritor said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The elder shook his head and said, “As long as Qing Yi is unwilling, in my Academy, it is our duty to protect our disciples. We will not allow outsiders to trouble her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Immortal Palace’s inheritor was quite decisive, turning around to leave. “I will return.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His tone was extremely cold. Even when facing a senior expert that was close to the Heavenly deity realm, he was still full of confidence, facing him calmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was clear that he wasn’t going to let this matter go. He would definitely invite over elders of corresponding cultivation realms to demand an ‘explanation’.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the distance, many people were watching this closely. Even though they couldn’t hear what these people were saying, they still received news that they wanted to bring Qing Yi away.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What right does he have to act so domineering? Immortal Palace really is something! Wasn’t he even killed once by Huang?!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Right? When Supreme Hall was at its most glorious, weren’t you all avoiding its radiance? Now all of you are pretending you are the ruler of the world? Who do you think you are?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many people were discontent, loudly discussing this matter.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, there were a few cultivators outside currently lodging at Goddess Academy who were partial to Immortal Palace’s inheritor.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No matter what, I will bring away Qing Yi!” When Immortal Palace’s inheritor left, he said this coldly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many people heard these words, immediately making quite a few people in the academy angry. This place became noisy, boiling with voices.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, there were a few cultivators from other great sects that stood by his side, all of them nodding in admiration towards his power, not fearing anything in his way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In reality, Immortal Palace’s inheritor was actually feeling quite anxious, finding it momentarily difficult to control his mood. It was because he was the second body, and soon after, he had to merge with the main body. It made him a bit nervous.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You really think you are worth anything, bringing away whoever you want?!” Right at this moment, a bright and clear voice sounded. A youth descended from the skies, a pair of lightning wings behind him. He was fast to the extreme.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Huang! He is Huang!" Many people cried out in alarm.</span></p>

He dared to challenge the Celestial Clan, drawing eyes from all directions. He was one of the most dazzling young supreme beings in the present age.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, he was the only one that made Immortal Palace’s second body suffer a great loss. Now that he appeared here, it triggered a huge sensation, making people excited.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Supreme Being Dao Rite’s great senior brother has arrived! Things are going to become lively now!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two heavenly talents faced each other. This place immediately erupted with commotion.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s you!” Immortal Palace’s inheritor raised his head, looking at Shi Hao who floated in the air. His eyes were cold, the silver symbols in his pupils surging and interweaving terrifying radiance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s me. Even someone like you dares to act so domineering here, talking nonsense about bringing Qing Yi away?!” Shi Hao shouted. His black hair was rich, his face delicate and handsome, his skin shining. He exuded a type of insurmountable confidence. Powerful divine might rippled outwards!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When these words left his mouth, this place completely erupted, becoming even more bustling with noise.&nbsp;</span></p>

This is an undisguised challenge, almost contempt!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many people were excited and stirred up, but there were also others that showed disdain. This place became extremely noisy.</span></p>

Everyone in the academy was startled, and the people staying at this academy temporarily were shocked as well, quickly hurrying over.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Immortal Palace’s inheritor replied with an ice-cold voice, saying, “You came at the perfect time. I was looking for you! Supreme Hall has long been wiped out, so what does the so-called Dao Rite want to stir up? Simply unsightly! Today, I want to bring away Qing Yi. What are you going to do about it?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qing Yi rose into the air, flying towards this direction. She had icy skin and jade bones, her beautiful hair pitch black as it hung down to her waist, smooth like satin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her long dress fluttered about. Qing Yi was like a fairy that skipped on water. She arrived, her beautiful figure releasing brilliance. Dark eyebrows rested on her sparkling white face. Her eyes were intelligent, her style unmatched.&nbsp;</span></p>

She was stunning, making even the sun in the sky even appear as if it were losing &nbsp;color.&nbsp;</span></p>

If you aren’t willing to give up, today, for Qing Yi’s sake, I will kill you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His black hair that fell down to his waist fluttered about.
