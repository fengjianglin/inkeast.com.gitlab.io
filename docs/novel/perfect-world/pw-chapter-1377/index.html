 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chapter 1377 - Secret Earth of the Past</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a serious issue that would affect the great situation of the future. Many people were holding their breaths, looking towards those elders on the cliffs where purple mist rose in spirals, waiting for them to explain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the cliff, an elder who was sitting on a praying mat, surrounded by immortal energy, released a sigh. A cool breeze blew past, exposing his aged face, his expression carrying a bit of disappointment and frustration.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The hearts of the young cultivators here all sunk. With the greater situation like this, was there really no hope in the future?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“With the foreign side being this powerful, how are we supposed to win? There are many people who feel that there is no chance of success at all. Just one undying being slaughtering his way over is already enough to completely wipe us out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the wall, the eccentrics didn’t avoid this issue, instead directly speaking about the most crucial parts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With reality being like this, even if there is a realm wall in the way, with the world’s natural laws rejecting them, this would still only stop them for some time, and not for an entire generation. It was because once the great world of the foreign side merged with this world, it would be difficult for the realm wall, natural laws, and other things to display any effects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I know that many people feel that things are pessimistic, to the extent where they are even in despair, not even able to see the slightest glimmer of chance for victory.” When the elder spoke up to here, he paused slightly, and then he emphasised, “But in reality, that is not the case. Let me tell all of you right now, the Desolate Border can be defended!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone was shocked. They all stared at the elders on the cliff. What other trump cards did this world have, was there anything else that could turn defeat into victory?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior, please explain things to us!” Exiled Immortal spoke up, asking the elder to speak in more detail.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The eccentric nodded and said, “Actually, our world is also extremely mysterious, with many secrets that have yet to be uncovered. For example, there are a few restricted areas that have existed for a long time, some even before the start of Immortal Ancient Great Era. Now, they are still standing tall, yet we cannot step foot into them. Of course, what I wish to talk about are not these things.” When he spoke up to this point, his eyes became deep, looking into the horizon, as if he could peer through Desolate Border. “What I wish to say, is that Desolate Border has an ancient city.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">En?</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">” Everyone was shocked, extremely confused.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only Shi Hao’s mind was shaken greatly, instantly thinking of something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There is an ancient city that had existed for an endless amount of time, difficult to trace back. It rests outside Desolate Border’s giant city, rising and falling with the world itself, with the flow of time, defending there the entire time.” The elder said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone became stupefied. A few people knew the inner details, that there was a giant city in Desolate Border. It was incredibly massive, towering into the cosmos, the walls made of stars, known to be the most powerful defensive position throughout history!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was an Emperor City that couldn’t be broken through!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, the old city this senior spoke about was definitely not this city, seemingly pointing at something else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sure enough, as he continued speaking, it verified everyone’s speculations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In Desolate Border, outside the so-called world’s sturdiest Emperor City, in the nothingness, the primal chaos, the blood dyed demonic earth, there is an ancient city!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It suppressed everything, preventing the foreign troops from treading onto this world!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This city was incredibly mysterious, some saying that it was ominous, a cursed ancient city. It had existed for a long, long time, couldn’t be investigated. It represented bitterness, accompanied by bloody radiance year-round.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were others who said that it was the most grand city, defending Desolate Border, protecting this world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were others who said that there was a group of the most stunning heavenly talents defending that place, but they all died in battle, turning that place into a city of death. However, before dying, they left behind world shaking methods, subduing the primordial zone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The elder slowly explained everything, in the end, he released a sigh, not saying which legend was true.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He only told those young experts that there was an ancient city there that would play a vital role, that it would make the undying beings feel restraining fear, prevent them from breaking through!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, this old city was only one of the Nine Heavens Ten Earths’ mysterious lands, it wasn’t the only trump card. There were still other strange places in Desolate Border!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone was shocked, even stunned!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a city outside Desolate Border, an old city where formidable people and events seemed to have taken place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Deal with the strange with the ominous, deal with enemies with the disastrous. It is an ancient city where blood flows!” The elder sighed, the expression of frustration and emotion becoming even heavier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many youngsters couldn’t understand. What kind of emotions was he feeling? Why was the elder like this? What kind of secrets were hidden within this? Why did they feel like he felt frustration and disappointment, as well as pain?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Underneath the cliff, there were some who did know why.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the very least, Shi Hao clenched his fists, his body going taut, breathing a bit difficult. It was because he thought of a possibility!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In his heart, the figures of a few experts appeared: Desolate Border’s Seven Kings!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Was it that city?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How could he forget? Back then, when he tried to track down the ominous, he entered a blood-soaked black ancient ship, seeing too many scenes on an altar. Outside the Desolate Border was a lonely city. There were a few creatures who were fighting bravely, Desolate Border’s Seven Kings fighting with their lives on the line.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time was ruthless. Some of Desolate Border’s seven kings withered away, some of them dying, full of grief and pain. Did that city and those people still exist?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After endless time passed, countless generations elapsed, what could still remain? Was it already a true city of death? This place was completely inauspicious!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao felt a wave of suffocation inside. He thought back to those scenes he saw on the altar. The elder and the child both stood on the city, participating in the battle, risking life and blood to protect it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, Shi Hao felt a bit of pain inside. Was that the so-called ancient city?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Why was it able to stop the foreign side? Were there some secrets hidden regarding this? It was clear that the elder only spoke about some things, not directly telling them everything. There was definitely something that made one feel great sadness involved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before, Shi Hao had previously thought about this before, whether the place Desolate Border’s Seven Kings guarded was the imperial pass, but in the end, he rejected this thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was because he had previously headed to the imperial pass. Before heading to the higher realms, the test the young cultivators from the Three Thousand Dao Provinces faced was precisely to hurry to that massive giant city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao had previously seen it, the two cities having differences!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Desolate Border’s Seven Kings, old city, I have to go there. My ancestors previously fought there, the sinner’s blood does not carry sin, but glory, honor, tears of blood!” Shi Hao said softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Apart from Shi Hao, Shi Yi, and Qin Hao’s eyes also shone with light, sensing something inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Apart from this, Six Crown King Ning Chuan also frowned slightly, clearly preoccupied with something, unknown what he was thinking!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Apart from this, there is another in Desolate Border that also protects our world.” The elder on the cliff said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Based on what he said, there was an abyss outside Desolate Border, but it didn’t lead to the depths of the great earth, but rather towards the heavens, completely opposite of what one would normally expect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heaven Abyss, it was bottomless, able to travel even through the star dome. There was no end to be found!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Desolate Border, just what kind of place is it exactly? How could there be so many strange things about this place?” Someone asked in confusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That place is extremely mysterious, with too many unknown secrets that not even we understand. However, it can separate the other side from our world. Apart from what I mentioned, there are still other things, even more so having great natural luck!” The elder said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What kind of natural luck?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There is a great dao comprehension Forest of Steles, limitless immortal ancient lands, vast divine medicinal mountain ranges, terrifying heavenly beast forests, even more so burial regions and other places…”</span></p>

It will depend on whether you all can stick it through or not, if you can come back alive.” The elder said things as they were. This was a land of loss, as well as a vicious place. There were heavenly opportunities, but it was also a place of nine deaths one life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn’t hide anything, directly saying that if a hundred geniuses headed there, a few people surviving was already not bad.</span></p>
