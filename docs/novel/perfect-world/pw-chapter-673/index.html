On his back were heavenly sword-like winged feathers. They had divine multicolored light curling about them, and they were wrapped in dense spiritual essence. Right now, the silver wings were brandished, and they hacked towards the little fatty.</span></p>

His situation was even more tragic. He was the first one to rush through the gate of light, yet the killing formation directly killed him. He didn’t even see who his opponent was, and only now did he learn who it was. He was naturally furious.&nbsp;</span></p>

He stood in the distance, looking like he was trying to help, but actually, he was circulating divine force, forming a formless energy wall to stop the fatty from returning.</span></p>

Underworld Race’s unique aura erupted. It was as if the gate of the underworld was opened, and it was going to drag the fatty inside!</span></p>

Only, with his apple-like round face, even if he was angry, it still looked a bit funny.</span></p>

He turned into a streak of flowing light, rushing into the surging auspicious multicolored immortal pond. With a raise of his hand, he smashed downwards. He looked like he was staking it all. The attack was extremely ferocious.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was exuding confidence.

It definitely exceeded the imagination of everyone in this world.</span></p>

This was just a bit too shocking.</span></p>

He pressed forward, wising to capture Cao Yusheng. He desired this type of forbidden killing formation that had existed before the opening of the heavens quite a bit.&nbsp;</span></p>

They wouldn’t dare to recklessly catch Cao Yusheng, because being able to have this type of inheritance meant that there was definitely an unsurpassed inheritance behind him!</span></p>

They were incomparably old, and it was rumored that they were connected to true ‘immortality’. That was why he could act so fearlessly.&nbsp;</span></p>
