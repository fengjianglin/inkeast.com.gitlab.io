 <p style="text-align: left"><strong>Chapter&nbsp;256 -&nbsp;The Treasure</strong></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“The praying mat is woven from twigs of elder wood. After going through a great many eons, it’s spirituality has worn out, however, it can still calm one’s mind and help them meditate. The praying mat is good for studying dao, and is a rare treasure.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Someone spoke aloud and dashed towards it, encouraging everyone to fight over it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With these being said, the crowd swarmed forward with astonishment. What exactly was elder wood? It was created between the heaven and earth, containing a divinity that connected into the heavens. The wood was a bridge linking the worlds of mortals and deities. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Previously, there was a gate on the islands where a spiritual stream flowed out from. A rotten log rested at the entrance, and that was precisely a piece of elder wood. A huge crowd immediately fought a long time over it, yet in the end, no one could even break into the gate. However, an entire praying mat that had been exquisitely woven from such a precious material was discovered, so this naturally made the crowd even more enthralled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was made from real divine wood, enabling one to communicate with the deities’ realm and get closer to the origin of dao. The praying mat would work countless wonders on cultivation and was considered a priceless treasure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A group of people rushed over while accompanied by all sorts of precious techniques. Splendid light drowned this place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Hao shouted with surging ferocity. He drew out the broken sword and infused it with the power of the ten heavenly passage divine ring. A streak of black light swept forward with a </span><i><span style>wenglong</span></i><span style> sound.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All sounds and clamoring faded at that moment. The splendid and dazzling lights had also vanished. The only thing remained was a black light that covered everything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Time seemed to have stopped, and the sky seemed to have shattered. The fleeting seconds felt like they were hours as everything froze. Finally, a soft sound was emitted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Various precious instruments cracked and exploded in mid-air before falling down in broken pieces. All of their symbols were crushed at the same time, their light quickly dimming.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pu</span></i><span style>. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A group of people’s upper bodies left their lower halves. They were severed in half at the waist, and their corpses fell down onto the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?!” The crowd shuddered with fear. Even the supreme experts’ expressions changed. A group of mighty beings were killed in one single strike. This youth’s strength was powerful to a terrifying degree.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With a flash of light as splendid as the rising sun, the glittering green praying mat disappeared into Shi Hao’s heaven and earth net and became his belonging.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The praying mat was made from interweaving strips of elder wood. When he sat on it while cultivating in the future, the praying mat would be very beneficial to him. The thought of this pleased Shi Hao greatly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The mood of the crowd, on the other hand, was not as great. The praying mat used by Kun Peng was no common object. It was a divine treasure, and it was entirely possible for some of its dao laws to have been left behind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the jade bottle had also been swiped by someone. The stone table was now empty, making everyone absolutely furious. Two precious treasures have already been taken by others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Hao walked out with the black broken sword in his hand. He was stared at by those lords and the supreme elder who had fought with him before. He was leaving this place, and no one could stop him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The legendary abode was enormous. Precious energy drifted about, and swarms of creatures were roaming about in search of the Kun Peng’s precious technique and other rare worldly treasures.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This place was full of miraculous objects. Things that the Kun Peng used casually were all magical artifacts and incredibly powerful. This filled everyone with longing and eagerness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They could see from the Divine Lamp of Illumination and Pure Jade Vase that the archaic Kun Peng didn’t care about these things at all and placed them around as it pleased. As a result, everyone felt their blood boiling as they searched everywhere with excitement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sure enough, someone found another treasure. Even though it wasn’t a famous magical artifact, it would still bring about quite a stir in the outside world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As a result, another huge wave of clamoring broke out. It was even more fierce than the previous fights, and intense war cries echoed through the cavern depths.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regardless of whether it was the noble lords or the other creatures, they all leapt over towards this place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Weapon Refining Ground!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Shi Hao rushed over, he saw a stone tablet. On top of it were carved these three ancient words, and after seeing them, he became greatly shocked. He finally knew why everyone was fighting so fiercely here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was this where the Kun Peng forged precious artifacts?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Specks of light drifted about in front of him. The spiritual essence here was extremely dense. A cold pond could be seen, and it was so bone-chillingly cold that people could feel their flesh and bones splitting apart even from far away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There really are precious artifacts here! They are inside that pool.” Someone cried out in alarm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Inside, there were several streaks of divine light flickering and moving about like fish. Upon closer inspection, they were actually sword cores, fine pagodas, and many other things. These were all crude materials left behind since archaic years that have not been completely refined yet!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even though these are all unfinished weapons, they all possess intelligence. These are all magical weapons passed down from the archaic times!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many people cried out loudly. These individuals could no longer hold back their urges, and were so stirred up that they were shaking. They were going to jump into the waters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Where would they see such things in the outside world? Needless to say, these were all top quality materials used to refine weapons. These objects were all incredibly rare in the outside world, and was enough to make everyone go mad.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heavens! That sword core is made of dragon bone iron! The legendary divine grade material was forged into a sword core. This is definitely a priceless divine treasure!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After someone recognized the sword core within the cold pond, that person’s expression immediately changed and couldn’t help but cry out in shock. This was truly a rare and valuable item that was difficult to put a price tag on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Legend has it that dragon bone iron was a resource formed when a real dragon died within a iron ore mine. It was a precious material that was of the highest quality, and if a weapon even contained a small piece of this steel, it would immediately become a supreme treasure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not to mention normal people, even the aristocratic nobles and clan lords’ eyes became red with greed. They all prepared to dive in and seize those treasures.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile there were supreme experts that immediately took action. These were the most ideal holy objects for them, because once they earnestly refined them, these items could truly resonate and belong to them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, after experiencing countless years of nourishment, the spiritual natures of these things became extremely powerful. Once formed, they would definitely become supreme magical artifacts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kill!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone flocked over, and there were even some that directly leapt towards the cold pond to obtain these treasures.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, something frightening occurred. As soon as they approached the cold pond, the surging cold air immediately froze more than ten people. Their bodies then fell down and cracked into pieces</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone felt their fine hairs standing on end. This cold pond was too scary! Why did things turn out like this? This was not merely a problem with the temperature. There was definitely a haunting divine force contained within.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rise!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A sect lord shouted out. His long sleeves fluttered about, causing divine light to surge. The cold energy was immediately dispersed. He rushed towards the cold pond with his precious technique to fish up a magical artifact.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, as soon as the symbols landed on the cold pond’s surface, they immediately shattered, proving to be useless. Moreover, after a short period of time, a loud explosion broke out, and a huge wave surged and slammed towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sect lord immediately retreated in a hurry. The dozen or so people beside him all shrieked miserably, but they were soon frozen solid into ice sculptures. Their bodies were already cracking apart, and they all died here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This place seems similar to the Abyss of Black Ice. There is some kind of divine power at work. It is tough for a normal person to enter and obtain anything.” Everyone shook their heads.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, someone took action. He leapt up and entered the cold pond without any fear. This was precisely the sea deity Mo Shang. A golden blaze surged around him, and he moved forward with the halberd in hand towards a sword core. He wanted to obtain it for his own use.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the magical artifacts within the pond all possessed intelligence. They moved about like a fish, quickly avoiding him and not giving him any opportunities.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good stuff!” From the shore, the devilish brat was drooling. He directly brought out the heaven and earth pouch. After opening it, strands of multicolored light flowed out to try and seize it.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The torrential waters roared. Endless streams surged from the cold pond, hiding the sky and covering the earth as it swept over. None of those precious artifacts arrived, and only the terrifying divine waters attacked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone was so terrified that they felt their souls departing. They immediately turned around to flee. This fucking brat was too hateful! Why did he bring down such a disaster on everyone? Everyone began to curse continuously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Hao was drenched by the cold water. However, as soon as he started to freeze, he shook fiercely, causing the ice to immediately shatter. Unfortunately, the heaven and earth pouch couldn’t collect any of those magical artifacts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the distance, everyone felt a raving fear as they watched this. That fellow was terrifying after all! He wasn’t scared of the cold at all.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Putong</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Water blossomed high up into the air as the Flaming Fish race Han Tian also jumped into the pond. At the same time, there were several supreme experts that similarly entered the icy cold waters to seize those precious artifacts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These treasures were so amazing that not even supreme experts could sit still anymore. They decided that they had to fight for it with everything they had. If they really could obtain a treasure like this, then once they earnestly refined it, it would definitely become a divine object.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mine, mine, all mine!” The devilish brat shouted loudly. In the end, he also jumped down towards those weapon cores and chased after them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the land creatures in the distance saw this, their hearts all trembled. They were extremely familiar with his character. When Yun Xi heard this sentence, her head even began to hurt. This savage fellow was going to go crazy again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sure enough, the first one to suffer was a pure-blooded creature from the Archaic Divine Mountains. After encountering the devilish child, it began to fight over a pagoda, but was sent flying after only a brief period of time. It spat out large amounts of blood and almost died on the spot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a pure-blooded creature that had already matured! It was twenty years old that abruptly rose to power. It was at the golden age of power, and showed disdain towards all others in its region. However, it almost killed just now!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, all the creatures within the cold pond simultaneously rushed towards Shi Hao’s location. They wanted to collaboratively take him out and seize the dazzling gem-like pagoda.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heavens! That’s a sacred pagoda formed from chaotic earth! It’s a bit more precious than even that dragon bone iron sword core! It really is a rarely seen item.” An old ancestor ashore cried out in surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though chaotic earth was called earth, it was definitely still a divine object. Once formed into a precious artifact, it became invulnerable. Moreover, there were even some symbol imprints from the era of primal chaos inside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just these primal chaos symbols alone was enough to make people go crazy. This could be considered a supreme treasure!</span></p>
 <p><span style>At first, no one noticed it. However, once Shi Hao was about to get his hands on it, several supreme experts and creatures from the Archaic Divine Mountains was alarmed. They began to fight over it together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This pagoda was incredibly unique. It was full of spirituality as it circled around Shi Hao. He couldn’t catch if after many attempts, and at this moment, the incoming experts immediately made Shi Hao feel even more rushed and muddled. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“All of you, drop dead!” The devilish brat flipped out and ferociously brandished his divine force. The broken sword in his hand hacked about, immediately sending out a streak of brilliant radiance to engage this incoming group.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Dang! </span></i><span style>Mo Shang had also arrived. The golden halberd in his hand hacked towards his head, only to be blocked by the broken sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A supreme expert roared. It spat out a mouthful of symbols that poured down like a stellar river. It submerged the area where Shi Hao was located to suppress him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The exquisite pagoda formed from chaotic earth immediately rushed towards the bottom of the pond, fleeing from Shi Hao’s side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The devilish brat became angry and immediately attacked everywhere in a chaotic manner. Ten heavenly passages emerged and formed a resplendent ring with him at the center. Even his flesh heavenly body appeared, and they all surged with auspicious multicolored light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A huge battle broke out as he frantically attacked these people. All types of techniques emerged. The divine striking stone smashed into an unfortunate pure-blooded creature, breaking the bridge of his nose and causing blood to trickle out from both his mouth and nose.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two years ago, that witch taught Shi Hao a string of incantations that helped him control the divine striking stone. Its power increased sharply, and now, even pure-blooded creatures would receive serious injuries after being struck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young expert from the Archaic Divine Mountains felt so much pain that even tears flowed out. He was angry to the extreme.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The divine striking stone cried out with </span><i><span style>ao ao </span></i><span style>sounds about the pain. It flew about, smashing all over the place, and many people suffered as a result. All of them were bleeding from their foreheads. Their expressions were ashen, and they were simply angry to an unbearable level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Mo Shang got caught up in these attacks, and even the crown on his head was shattered. His hair was now rather dishevelled, cutting a sorry appearance. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone stared blankly at this scene. Finally, that piece of crazy rock finally stopped and entered the waters, no longer striking at them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mine, mine, all mine.” The divine striking stone shouted loudly as it chased after the pagoda formed out of chaotic earth. It wanted to smash it apart to eat it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whi Shi Hao chased after it, he noticed that the divine striking stone was crying out with pain while smashing itself into the pagoda. It was using everything it had to bite it to pieces and eat it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was obvious that its teeth weren’t good enough. This was not just chaotic earth, because after it was turning into an artifact core, there were some symbols inside that prevented it from being broken.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though the exquisite pagoda possessed intelligence, it was not something that had its own mind. As a result, it was still caught by Shi Hao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please give it to me! In the future, I will definitely behave myself!” The divine striking stone was shouting noisily because this kind of object was too important for its growth. If it truly refined the pagoda, then it would be able to improve and transform.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Give it to me!” Suddenly, a feeble yet terrifying will rang out within Shi Hao’s mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are you?” The devilish brat became fearful. This was the first time he felt somewhat scared and upset. Ever since he stepped into this restrictive ocean region, he had yet to be scared of anything until now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though this will was weak, it could still make one’s soul tremble. It could make one feel as if the world was shattering, as if a new heaven and earth was opening.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A piece of bright and crystalline object appeared in front of his eyes. It came from his hair, and was surprisingly the small pagoda that was less than an inch in length. It landed on the chaotic earth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s you?” Shi Hao was shocked. This was the first time that this object reacted, and it actually spoke, immediately giving him a huge fright.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Exchange.” The crystalline and transparent bone pagoda’s words were concise. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Hao didn’t understand, asking it what it meant by ‘exchange’.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The finger length bone pagoda released a divine mental fluctuation, informing him that it would grant him a one time use. If he was stuck in a desperate situation, it would slaughter all of his enemies and tear apart the void to help him escape.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Hao was shaken. In simpler words, this was a life saving opportunity. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fine!” He nodded in agreement. Even though the artifact core formed from chaotic earth was amazing, it was not as important as his life. He wasn’t on the losing end of this exchange.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was because he believed in this bone pagoda’s strength. It was something that could even make the Willow Deity become serious, a bone artifact that it wasn’t willing to talk about.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kacha</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The small pagoda directly smashed the chaotic earth into pieces, devouring the large piece at its center.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big bro, leave some for me!” The divine striking stone cried out miserably. It then jolted its buttocks over to curry favor from that small pagoda.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kacha</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The small sparkling pagoda didn’t seem to pay any attention to it. After it devoured most of the chaotic earth, it only left behind some scraps before returning to Shi Hao’s hair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Some powder scattered down from the bone pagoda, and it was clear that the small pagoda had completely refined the chaotic earth. It absorbed a portion of its essence and acquired the damaged chaotic symbols before returning to a peaceful and unmoving state.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big bro, much thanks!” Upon seeing this, the divine striking stone exalted. It knew that the other party didn’t think much of these scraps, so it directly threw itself over before devouring it viciously. </span></p>
 <p><span style>It couldn’t even chew through the complete pagoda anyway. The leftover fragments were perfectly fine for it, so it wolfed it down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The devilish brat seemed rather envious while watching this scene. “Does it really taste that good?” He spoke while reaching out, wanting to get a piece of itself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The divine striking stone immediately shrieked miserably and said, “You don’t need to fight with me! You can’t eat this kind of stuff!” Following that, it quickly protected its food and swallowed all of it.</span></p>
