A large portion of the divine force was redirected outside this region.&nbsp;</span></p>

He wasn’t afraid. The energy within his body erupted, and his body instantly enlarged. It was as if it could support both heaven and earth as it towered into the heavens.&nbsp;</span></p>

Heavy golden mist overflowed into the heavens. Outside of his body, a ring of light curled up around him like stellar streams. He looked like an ancient existence that had existed before the opening of the world.&nbsp;</span></p>

Within the vague sounds, draconic cries sounded. One could fuzzily see a divine phoenix undergoing rebirth. It was an extremely strange sight. An indescribable type of dao aura was swirling about.&nbsp;</span></p>
