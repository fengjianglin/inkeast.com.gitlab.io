 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao immediately didn’t feel like listening. His face fell, saying, “Old thing, what are you saying? I already defeated him twice, yet you still don’t think I can kill him? You shouldn’t underestimate me like this!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qi Daolin sighed and said, “If not for news travelling around recently, I wouldn’t even have known about this. The one that is travelling the world is just a second body. We’ve underestimated him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a serious problem. He deeply understood that the main body of Immortal Palace’s inheritor was definitely going to be even stronger. Once they merged, their cultivation would be hard to predict.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In his opinion, Immortal Palace’s inheritor even seemed to have the confidence in defeating those ancient freaks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Shi Hao heard this, he was rather unwilling to accept it. “How powerful could he be?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Powerful to a ridiculous level. It definitely won’t be something as simple as adding the two bodies together, but a sudden surge in power. Once they merge, his fighting power will erupt like a volcano.” Qi Daolin sighed and said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not even he had anticipated that Immortal Palace would cultivate this type of ancient method in secret. It was because it was extremely difficult to do, as well as exceedingly dangerous.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They originally thought that Immortal Palace was only testing this on Yue Chan, never expecting that their own inheritor also cultivated it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In this world, there were actually two who succeeded!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao frowned and said, “Is it that scary? What kind of background does that ancient method have exactly? If I have to, I’ll ask Qing Yi for it and cultivate it a bit too.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It is more terrifying than your imagination, something created by an undying existence. However, you shouldn’t try to learn it. One person into two, a single mistake and a huge issue will arise.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Undying existence?” Shi Hao was shocked. He immediately thought of the powerful existence that had been suppressed under Five Phase Mountain in the lower realm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That existence is extremely terrifying. Rumor has it that this existence is the posthumous child of an unmatched creature from the most ancient era, and perhaps related to the Kun Peng. Of course, these are all just rumors.” Qi Daolin said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Shi Hao heard this, great flames raged within him. He immediately asked about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qi Daolin shook his head. He only heard a few rumors as well. That existence had never seen the parents, and after birth, was sealed in primal chaos for millions of years before emerging.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao was stupefied. It was that senior that was sealed in the lower realm after all!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Immortal Palace has a few matchless secret techniques, but they didn’t establish them, but obtained them from other inheritances. It could even be said that their hands are covered in blood…” Qi Daolin laughed coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao finally understood why the undying existence was suppressed under Five Phase Mountain, difficult to kill even after all this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The technique Immortal Palace has is imperfect. That undying existence also divided into two bodies, and as long as one body dies and the other is alive, then they can be reborn. In addition, each time he dies once, he will experience a rebirth and carry out a life and death enlightenment, giving him a chance to become a bit stronger. This is the most fundamental difference between the perfect technique and the technique Immortal Palace obtained.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Separate into two bodies to cultivate, when merged again, become even more powerful. However, the undying existence’s perfect technique had a life and death rebirth, allowing for further advancement.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That is why if you truly wish to kill that undying existence, both of his bodies must be killed at the same time, or else each time a single body is killed, it will only allow his comprehension to grow deeper, possibly becoming even stronger.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao asked where the undying existence went. This existence definitely stood at his side, but the information he obtained was similar to the rumors, that he had long entered the depths of the uninhabited region’s depths!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This seems to be the root of everything. Could it be that everyone will eventually have to go there?” Shi Hao said softly. He felt that Willow Deity and little pagoda might be in the restricted area’s depths.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And now, even Qi Daolin was going to go.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You have to be careful about Celestial Clan’s resolution. You have to know how to protect yourself when I am not here.” Qi Daolin warned.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He especially warned that with that dao protector’s life nearing its end, the reason he directly fled after his defeat last time was likely so that he could truly use up the last of his energy. He might take extreme action.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, if the Celestial Clan’s dao protector took action, they definitely wouldn’t hold back, going as far as needed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have my own ways of protecting myself,” said Shi Hao. He had two Realm Shattering Symbols now, so he didn’t have to worry. He just had to calmly wait for the great competition to start. When he came out again, it might be a completely different scene.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had previously heard that each time this incomparable battle of geniuses started, the shortest length would be a year, the longest unexpectedly lasting a hundred years before the people within came out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During the longest time, there had even been someone who defied the heavens, directly reaching heavenly deity level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">, work hard then. Enter that ‘Immortal Ancient’. Aside from the greatest natural luck, there are exceptional divine fruits, immortal treasures, and other things, any one of them will be greatly beneficial for the rest of your life. For example, the ‘heavenly deity’ fruit, once you eat it,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">heh!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">”&nbsp;</span></p>

Otherwise, he would definitely clean out those ‘saint wood’, ‘heavenly deity fruits’, ‘immortal core’ and other things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were too many divine objects inside, things that all large sects longed after. This was also why they were so focused on nurturing and encouraging disciples to participate. Even if they couldn’t become number one, as long as they could come out alive, they would obtain unimaginably great harvests.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What do I have to be mindful of, for example, the various dangers?” Shi Hao asked, seeking guidance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There are many dangers, and it is different each time.” Qi Daolin said. Then, he reminded that even though the Celestial Clan was defeated, he couldn’t look down on them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao muttered to himself about how that clan had declined. Their so-called exceptional talent You Yu, if not for merging with the Heaven’s Mandate Stone recently, there was no way he would become so powerful, fighting with him for such a long time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I knew you were being careless. The Celestial Clan is not simple. Previously in history, there was a youngster who merged with three Heaven’s Mandate Stones, known as Three Stone Heavenly Monarch.” Qi Daolin shook his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What? Merged with three pieces of Heaven’s Mandate Stone? Did his natural aptitude defy the heavens?” Shi Hao was shocked. There were six great celestials in the archaic era, but that was still only six Heaven’s Mandate Stones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was someone who unexpectedly merged with three pieces of Heaven’s Mandate Stone alone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“His aptitude was only normal, not an exceptional talent. Before he merged with them, he was obscure and unknown,” Qi Daolin said, and then he added seriously, “However, after undergoing three perfect transformations, no matter how lacking his aptitude was, he still became unimaginably powerful.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is he still alive?” Shi Hao frowned.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rumor has it that his whereabouts were lost after he explored some Immortal Ancient ruins.” Qi Daolin said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then, he said, “The hundred rivers gathering into the sea has long begun filtering people out, registering names. You haven’t paid too much attention to it, while I don’t have much time left now either. You should think of a way yourself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao was speechless.&nbsp;</span></p>

Shi Hao cursed silently. Didn’t they say that a few great sects could directly select and send people over, not needing to go through complicated procedures?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Just muddle your way in with any random inheritance. It’s not that strict.” Qi Daolin patted his shoulder.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Immortal Mine?!” Shi Hao was shocked.&nbsp;</span></p>

There was one that was known to be an Immortal Mine, but there hadn’t been many throughout history that could enter. It was extremely dangerous.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The reason why I placed the dao rite here is precisely because I was paying close attention to that ancient mine. I’ve waited for many years already. This time, there might be a brief period of opportunity, a fleeting chance.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qi Daolin had previously stolen from hundreds of clans, and he had plundered a bone fragment that had a few secret rumors recorded on it. Through it, he was able to discover omens of the Immortal Mine’s emergence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After waiting for so many years, he finally obtained some clues.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fire Province wasn’t made up entirely of grasslands. There were different types of terrain within the innermost depths.&nbsp;</span></p>

Then, an abnormality happened. Cracks appeared on the ground in the distance, releasing dazzling immortal light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In addition, with the passage of time, great dao rumbling sounds rang through the air, becoming clearer and clearer.&nbsp;</span></p>

Meanwhile, Qi Daolin had long took action staring in that area with brilliant eyes. It was as if they were blazing torches. His entire body was covered in bone texts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hong!</span></p>

A large mountain rose from the earth, surrounded by primal chaos mists. It was incomparably massive and imposing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">About halfway up the mountain, there was an ancient cave that released auspicious multicolored light. Immortal mists pervaded the air, creating a shocking scenery. Deafening great dao sounds rumbled, pouring out like a sea.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Waited for such a long time, but the day has really come!” Qi Daolin no longer remained clam. He looked extremely moved, releasing dazzling symbols. He brought Shi Hao with him, directly rushing over.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was an ancient mine. As soon as they entered, there was a wave of holy aura that made Qi Daolin tremble greatly.</span></p>

When they walked inside, it was unexpectedly like a palace hall. Moreover, there were hatchet carvings and sword traces. It was quite clear that these were man made.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Something doesn’t seem right. These sword traces, blade marks… were left behind by exceptional experts!” Qi Daolin was alarmed. Someone as powerful as him, at his cultivation realm, who didn’t feel moved by the things of the outside world, even changed his expression after arriving here.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“These were… left behind by an unmatched forbidden existence!”</span></p>

He stared at the cave walls, becoming more shocked the longer he looked at it. It was because there were indescribable great dao auras within every trace, incomparably profound and mysterious.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One has to understand that these were not deliberately left behind by others, not for the sake of passing down anything. They were just ordinary blade marks, sword traces, left behind from opening up this cave dwelling.</span></p>

They were all left by matchless experts who were powerful to a heart shaking degree.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is Origin Stone?” Qi Daolin finally recognized the source of the cave’s stone walls. It was simply earth-shattering, leaving him so shocked his eyes opened widely.</span></p>

Its price was similar to World Stone, a natural supreme treasure core.&nbsp;</span></p>
