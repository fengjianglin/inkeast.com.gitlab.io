Their armors shone one after another. Their precious artifacts were chilly, releasing powerful killing intent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How powerful was this group of experts? Any one of them could be a granted the title of king in the present world. They all possessed power at the top of this world. When Immortal Mountain saw them all grouped up like this, Immortal Mountain was completely overshadowed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bullying my Stone Country like this and humiliating my Stone Emperor, all of you deserve to die!” A middle-aged king level figure said. His nature was more violent. In his hands was a heaven-might halberd. With a&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">hong&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">sound, he attacked first, hacking outwards.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they truly reached this point, Immortal Mountain’s elders instead felt apprehensive. They quickly moved out of the way. The main reason was because the other party was too powerful. Three great supreme experts were leading this group of king level figures, so there was truly a chance that they might be wiped.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hong!</span></p>

Those individuals dodged out of the way. An enormous palace exploded, turning into broken pieces.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You all have crossed the line!” QIn Clan’s elder roared, but he was clearly not looking as imposing as before. He was unsure what would happen if a battle truly broke out, because Immortal Mountain might not necessarily have the advantage. They only had a single supreme expert. Even though they had formations to use, what level of magical artifacts did other party have?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three great supreme experts’ precious artifacts were shining like a resplendent sun. They released the aura of deities. A terrifying wave of energy rippled outwards.&nbsp;</span></p>

They were now brought over!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Clan’s supreme experts’ faces fell. Even though Immortal Mountain had magical artifacts like these, with only a single person to use them, how could they compare?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was especially true since the formations were broken and in disorder from the previous great battle. Even if they activated all of them, they might not necessarily be able to block three supreme experts who held divine magical artifacts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Humiliating my Stone Clan, today, we demand an explanation. If you don’t explain yourselves, then what harm is there in wiping out your inheritance today?!” The War King said coldly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If Stone Emperor wasn’t injured, would you all have dared to act like this? Do not forget who it was that overturned your Immortal Mountain back then!” Peng Nine coldly exposed an old scar. While speaking, his hands forcefully tightened. That old woman cried out miserably as numerous bones broke. Then, she was tossed onto the ground.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You all…” The old woman’s face turned yellow, directly going unconscious. Her cultivation had been ruined!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you all won’t give us a satisfactory explanation, then a war it is. Who is my Stone Country scared of?!” The Ming King spoke. Even though he was already over a hundred years old, after breaking into the supreme expert realm, his vitality was still flourishing and he was full of imposing might.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You all…” A few elders from Qin Clan felt conflicted, as well as a bit of regret.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even such a hidden cursed bowl was discovered by a supreme expert. They were truly left helpless.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was because they were truly worried that Shi Ziling and his wife would put the immortal bone into Shi Hao’s body. As a result, they urgently wished for him to die, not wishing for his parents to make that choice.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the end, they clenched their teeth, pushing out an old servant whose cultivation wasn’t normal and saying that it was he who decided to do this without seeking anyone’s approval on the matter.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though this was clearly a scapegoat that no one would believe, it was still enough to make the Qin Clansmen’s faces become unpleasant. How did they end up being forced to this state?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Today, they had to choose their actions carefully, because their fighting strength wasn’t comparable to before. This had never happened before!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Being forced to endure everything silently and push out this scapegoat was truly the same as taking a slap to the face. Every single individual’s face was burning hot. They felt furious inwardly, finding this difficult to accept.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was because they were Immortal Mountain, a sect that previously looked down on the eight regions for many eras. Today, they were actually given such a blow to the face like this and forced to take it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was precisely at this time when footsteps sounded. A silver flame appeared on the road, closing in a manner that was neither fast or slow. A powerful and holy aura was being exuded.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a youth who wore silver armor. He had an incredibly heroic appearance. Divine splendor scattered about him. It was as if a supreme heavenly deity descended into the lower realm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was precisely Qin Hao. In his hands was a silver halberd. He pointed it forward, the weapon full of inviolable divine might!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His gaze was incredibly deep. “If you want to fight, do you think we are scared? I want to see who will wipe out the inheritance here!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Heng!</span></p>

Would they be scared of a youth?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Hao wore divine magical clothes. At this moment, his chest shone. Symbols erupted in large amounts, also a silver color. They were incomparably holy and pure, releasing terrifying fluctuations.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The War King, Peng King, and the others were naturally fearless. However, they already knew that they needed this youth to save Shi Hao, so they didn’t treat his words as nothing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Ziling and his wife sighed. Their second son came, so they had no choice but to stand up and try to mediate things. They couldn’t let the situation get any worse.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pa!</span></p>

Blood splashed out in all directions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Qin Hao’s expression went rigid.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other side, the faces of everyone from the Qin Clan darkened, and the veins on their foreheads jumped. However, they still endured it in the end. This palm felt as if it landed on everyone’s faces.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right at this moment, Shi Hao woke up. He widened his eyes and weakly said, “Father, mother, I don’t want the immortal bone. If it is like this, I would rather die!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He looked at the War King, Peng Nine, and the others and said, “Escort me… back to Stone Country.”</span></p>

Thank you for nurturing me with such love, but I can’t repay you. I truly don’t want little brother’s bone. I… experienced all of this already, so how can I make him go through the same thing?!”</span></p>

His eyes lacked radiance, no longer appearing heroic and imposing. Right now, his condition was extremely grave.&nbsp;</span></p>

I want to stay there.”</span></p>
