 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You all better get out!” Shi Ziling roared. How could he not know what happened? If not for Shi Hao’s spiritual senses still remaining active and rousing him awake, he would have died in an underhanded manner.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shi Ziling, don’t cross the line. Your eldest son killed a disciple under my clan’s direct line of descent. It is bad enough you aren’t punishing him, but you still speak like this. You are going too far!” The old woman who held the green wooden staff said with an overcast face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Get lost!” Shi Ziling erupted with rage. His eldest son was already close to dying, yet someone still attacked and injured him. In the end, they even falsely accused him. Rage filled his chest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">qiang</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;sounded. A golden spear appeared in his hands. Veins appeared on his arms as he gripped it tightly. There was no point in explaining anything else now. He was ready to fight!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You… even want to use force?” Several experts’ faces fell.&nbsp;</span></p>

Her eyebrows stood vertically, and her large eyes were opened wide. She pointed at everyone and shouted, “If a single hair on Hao’er’s head is harmed, Immortal Mountain can forget about their sect in the lower realm!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The expressions of these people went cold. Even though they were angry, they all endured it. It was because Qin Yining’s identity wasn’t ordinary, and her bloodline in the higher realms won, so they were in control over everything. Apart from this, there was Qin Hao who had the immortal bone implanted as well, and he was still her child in the end. He was someone who will reach the realm of supreme being in the future!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The house became quiet. Those individuals backed up. The flame within the bronze lamp flickered about, making this room rather dark. Shi Hao went unconscious again. Every time, he could only remain conscious for a moment, and it was getting more and more serious.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Ziling sat beside the bed silently. He felt an extremely great pressure. What were they supposed to do?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There’s not much time left. We can’t drag it on any longer. Hao’er is becoming weaker and weaker, and his time is running out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Ziling’s voice was hoarse and filled with great pain. His eyes carried bloody lines. He suddenly stood up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What are you going to do? Are you going to gouge out the bone of our other child? He… how will he feel? There’s even a chance of him dying! Are we to use his life in exchange for his older brother’s?” Qin Yining asked with tears in her eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are we supposed to just watch as Hao’er dies? With every passing minute, he will become much weaker. We have already dragged things on for an entire day!” Shi Ziling felt dejected. He looked outside the window into the misty night. The stars became dim and dark clouds drifted over, making the mood even more downcast.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The candle flame went dim. The face of Shi Hao on the bed was pale. His eyes were closed. His body was becoming weaker and weaker.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Ziling tightened his fists and said, “That won’t do! Back then, we already turned our backs on him, not staying by his side. He was so young, forced to experience so many bloody events in the Martial Imperial manor alone, becoming so weak he nearly died. Later on, we placed him alone in Stone Village and never did what parents ought to do. We never properly took care of him. During these years, all of his accomplishments were earned through his own hard work. From such a young age, he left Stone Village on his own, fighting against all types of vicious birds and ferocious beasts in the great wastelands, fighting his way to power step by step.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Ziling took a deep breath and said, “He looks splendid with power that can shake the world, but exactly how much suffering and difficulties has he experienced during all of this? That was the result he fought for alone. Meanwhile, what did we do? We never took care of him, never completing our mission as parents. We haven’t done anything for him!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Yining weeped. She sat in front of the bed while holding Shi Hao’s hand, gently caressing it. As she watched his vitality become weaker and weaker, she felt as if she was suffocating.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their eldest son never hated them. He slaughtered his way into the Qin Clan alone, all for the sake of freeing them, not hesitating at all to fight a bloody battle against Immortal Mountain, one of the most powerful great sects.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Yining’s voice trembled as she said, “What exactly should we do? How miserable is Hao’er’s fate? This time, could it be that there’s truly no other way but to gouge out the bone of our other child, putting him in danger of death too? How tragic is this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We already lost Hao’er once. Last time, we didn’t properly protect him, didn’t carry out our duty as parents. This time, are we supposed to look on helplessly as he departs this world? I will never be able to rest easy for the remainder of my life!” Even more bloody veins appeared in Shi Ziling’s eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But what about our other child? How unfair and miserable is this for him?” Qin Yining said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We can’t worry about that. If our second son feels inner turmoil then so be it. Rescuing Hao’er is the most important thing, or else he’s going to die immediately!” Shi Ziling had no idea what would end up happening after they did this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Father, are you going to gouge out my bone?” The door pushed open. Qin Hao appeared, his face appearing calm. His eyes were deep as he stood there, no longer stepping forward.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Ziling opened his mouth. However, nothing came out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s fine. Father, mother, if you two feel that this can save older brother, then come over and take my bone.” Qin Hao said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Child, you don’t need to overthink things. In our hearts, you and your big brother are both equally important. We would never make you a sacrifice.” Qin Yining said while shedding tears, appearing incomparably pained.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wasteland region Stone Country’s War King, Ming King, and Peng King have come to pay a visit. Please open the mountain gate!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right at this moment, a great voice rang through the skies, reaching the depths of Immortal Mountain. It was clear that the ones who came were supreme experts, raising up a great commotion.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Reporting, Stone Country’s people came. There are actually… three supreme experts!” Someone reported.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many of Immortal Mountain’s people’s faces changed. This was an era without deities, and even supreme experts were hard to find, yet Stone Country unexpectedly had three supreme experts. This made everyone shiver in fear.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Stone Country’s kings have arrived. Is this to deal with us?” The old woman who held the green wood staff became gloomy. She felt like this things weren’t looking good.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Outside the mountain gate, the Ming King, War King, and Peng Nine stood together, and behind them were many powerful experts as well. They were all king level figures who wore armor that flickered with cold glint. Every single one of them carried a few wooden cases that contained precious medicines.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The so-called Peng King was precisely Peng Nine. This was a title Shi Hao bestowed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Kings, please come in.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Eventually, the Qin Clan opened the mountain gate, inviting them in. They presumed that they came for Shi Hao, so it was likely that they weren’t here to fight.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Immortal Mountain’s people felt alarmed. Three great supreme experts descended, every single of of them carrying diving magical artifacts. This truly exuded an intimidating pressure! If conflict broke out between them, then the results would be unimaginable.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, there wasn’t a single ordinary soldier behind them. They were all king level figures. When a group like this showed up, they could definitely wipe out a great sect!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When something happened to Shi Hao, the War King, Peng Nine, and the others mobilized all forces to acquire all types of ancient treatments and asked great sects for holy medicines. They disregarded all costs. As long as they could cure Shi Hao, they were willing to pay any price.&nbsp;</span></p>
