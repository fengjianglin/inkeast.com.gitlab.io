Even though there was sadness, there was even more happiness. The innermost part of Shi Hao was satisfied. Tears flowed down his smiling face as he felt waves of deep affection.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t blame your younger brother…” It was clear that when the husband and wife tore apart the void, they saw Shi Hao stand in opposition against his brother and even take action against each other.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They opened their mouths. There were too many things they wanted to say, but they didn’t know where to begin. They wished for their children to get along with each other.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao understood what they were trying to say. He earnestly nodded and said, “Me and little brother are brothers. We will mutually take care of each other.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It really can’t be blamed on him…” Tears flowed down from Qin Yining’s face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That year when they returned from the hundred thousand li of blood purged wasteland, all hopes of this married couple turned to dust. Their hearts felt that things were bleak, and they were full of pain and sorrow. They thought about that child who suffered such a miserable fate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was hard for them to dispel such thoughts, and they could not forget about the past. The young Shi Hao was so adorable and strong. He was a natural born supreme being, yet his supreme being bone was gouged out by another and left in an unbearably weak state. In the end, he was moved to Stone Village in a near dying state, as if his life would go out at any moment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During all of this time, the married couple had always been submerged under torment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the end, what allowed them to walk out from the darkness was their second child. He was similarly young and tender, with large and bright eyes and also incomparably cute. The two finally entrusted everything onto him, developing hopes within themselves again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For this reason, they also named their second child ‘Hao’, continuing on the name of their eldest son. They continued to call him Shi Hao. They missed their previous child greatly and could not forget about him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unfortunately, since he was born in the Immortal Mountain, there were many things that were difficult to change. The second child was paid particular attention to by the Qin Clan, and with high hopes placed on him, his surname was changed to Qin, so he became Qin Hao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The second son received the education of the Qin Clan. His astonishing talents were unravelled, and he was truly powerful to a terrifying degree. The clan began to dote on him quite greatly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Ziling and his wife couldn’t stop the Qin Clan’s people from changing the surname of their second child, so they ended up just calling him Hao’er. They made it past their initial sorrow and placed all of their care onto this second son, hoping that he would be able to grow up healthily and without worries.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Regardless, the Qin Clan was wholeheartedly raising him, providing this child with enough resources. This wasn’t something that the husband and wife would reject.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was no need to doubt the love parents had for their children. The two loved their second child greatly, even though the amount of time he was at their side was far less than when he was with the other Qin clansmen.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One day, intentionally or otherwise, some people from the Qin Clan told this child that he was born for the sake of saving the first child of his parents.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Why? The young Qin Hao couldn’t help but shout out loudly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Someone from Qin Clan then told him that he entered into this world with a great goal, and that was to save a child of the past.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They also told him that if that child was to be saved, then for the next few years, he would have been extremely weak. His essence blood was needed as medicinal nourishment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That day, Qin Hao wept loudly, continuously shedding tears. He found his parents and asked loudly if he was just a replacement. He asked them if there really was an older brother, and if he was born purely for his sake.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Ziling and his wife felt greatly sorrowful, but they used a gentle voice to tell him that there really was an older brother before, but he has already died. They would never be able to meet him, and that Qin Hao wasn’t a replacement.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps when this child first came into this world, they wanted to use him to save their first child, but they would still never harm his life. After all, they were both their own children.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In addition, after Shi Hao died, the married couple concentrated all of their affection on him instead.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In reality, as father and mother, how could they not love their own child? This was especially the case after the first child was lost. The two treasured their second son even more.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Qin Hao continued to remember that he used to have an older brother. Qin Clan’s elders continued to tell him that his parents only had him to save that older brother.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Ziling naturally loathed the Qin Clan. How could they instruct a child like this and plant this type of seed? The sorrowful matters had already passed, so why was there a need to let a child know?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the two of them couldn’t change anything.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You really cannot blame your younger brother… he is just a child, and it is something that had always bothered him. He always thought that he couldn’t be compared to you in our hearts…” Qin Yining spoke like this again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao could feel that the father and mother loved that younger brother of his greatly. They continuously explained out of fear that they wouldn’t get along.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Father, mother, I know that no matter what, he is my dear little brother, a close family member,” Shi Hao said softly so they wouldn’t have to say anymore.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them nodded. They pulled on his hand and continuously talked about the past.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two years ago, news of the great battle of the two Stones left every region greatly shaken. Qin Hao unexpectedly found out that his older brother had not died, and as a result began to compare himself to Shi Hao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If such a powerful older brother whose power shook the world returned, how would his parents feel? This was something that had weighed on his mind ever since he was little. He wanted to compare himself to his older brother.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The battle of two Stones lasted for an extremely long time. Shi Ziling and his wife would occasionally receive information that their weak older son was actually still alive and became so outstanding, overlooking all of his peers. They immediately shed great tears of joy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was also that day when they noticed the bit of pain within Qin Hao’s heart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Child, you don’t understand how happy we were when we found out that you were still alive. It was as if we didn’t feel any regrets anymore.” Qin Yining was his mother. She wanted to say something, but she could only cry and laugh at the same time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fight two years ago shook everything under the heavens. The little Stone’s name rang through all directions, and even the mysterious region knew of his existence. The married couple felt guilty but proud at the same time. That was their child, who, even without relying on them, rose up to greatness and made his name shake the world on his own!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unfortunately, after that battle, the little Stone directly disappeared. Only after vanishing for two years did he reappear.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I loathe Immortal Mountain!” Shi Ziling said while frowning.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was because based on what he said, even Shi Yi’s growth was due to some of the Immortal Mountain’s involvement, hiddenly providing resources through Demonic Spirit Lake. It was all for the sake of plucking his precious bone when he matured.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unfortunately, something unexpected happened. The battle between two Stones took place in the Void God Realm. Even when Qin Clan sent people over, they still weren’t the two youths’ opponents.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, they knew where Shi Yi’s real body was. It was hidden with Demonic Spirit Lake, so when the battle ended and he died, Qin Clansmen immediately made the move to seize his body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What left them feeling regret and apprehension was that the undying legend, that gray clad woman reappeared. She was completely unrivalled, and no one could stop her as she brought Shi Yi’s flesh away, leaving their plans to pluck this great medicine useless.&nbsp;</span></p>

No wonder Qin Clan tried to rope him in and felt such apprehension, as well as worry and fear. There were actually so many secrets they were hiding. The first was the defeat of his mother’s bloodline in the higher realms, and that they were trapped here. The second was that when he was at his last gasp, Qin Clan coldly refused to help, cruelly telling his parents that they definitely wouldn’t waste a holy medicine. The third was that for the sake of plucking a great medicine, they even assisted Shi Yi in his growth. With all of these things happening in succession, how could Immortal Mountain not feel any worry? They feared that he would find out everything after meeting his mother and father.&nbsp;</span></p>

It stared at the altar here continuously. It clearly felt a supreme being’s aura.&nbsp;</span></p>

It seemed to need the assistance of people like &nbsp;Qin Hao and Shi Hao. It had long heard about these matters.&nbsp;</span></p>

He was beaten until he coughed out blood. The great hero, Great Demonic God, was humiliated here. Blood continuously left his mouth.&nbsp;</span></p>

That time, he called over Qin Hao, because regardless, the second son received quite a bit of affection from the Immortal Mountain’s old ancestors and could make many things happen.&nbsp;</span></p>

He had to help his grandfather and A’Man into the transport formation so that they could escape.&nbsp;</span></p>
