Only, there were a few divine corpses that rose and fell within it, destroying its aesthetic perception.&nbsp;</span></p>

This time, his benefits were extremely great. He broke through the shackles of lightning, transcending the limits of the Suan Ni’s precious technique and taking a huge step forward.&nbsp;</span></p>

When he moved, lightning curled about his body and every pore of his body released electrical light. There was a mysterious and powerful lightning magical force to his body.&nbsp;</span></p>

Lightning was one of this world’s greatest powers. When it reached its peak, it could make the world lose color.</span></p>

The heavens rained down a calamity, using forbidden lightning to kill him, destroying his body and scattering his dao.&nbsp;</span></p>

Only today did he break through, taking a vital step forward.&nbsp;</span></p>

Then, it suddenly erupted with power, rushing through the air while bringing endless silver electricity with it as it pounced at Shi Hao.</span></p>

He had long detected that this vicious beast was closing in on him. With a raise of his hand, energy hacked out from his palm, blasting towards the supreme expert realm beast.&nbsp;</span></p>

It had lived in this region for several hundred years already. Even in the supreme expert realm, it rarely encountered opponents.&nbsp;</span></p>

As a result, it produced a few mysterious and powerful creatures. It was a place full of unknowns and danger.&nbsp;</span></p>

This silver creature who had four hundred years of dao cultivation was pierced through by a streak of lightning. All of its scales flew about, and blood gushed outwards.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was no match for Shi Hao. It suffered a severe injury from their very first exchange.&nbsp;</span></p>

Together with a streak of lightning, it hacked outwards. The several dozen zhang long silver lizard quickly dodged, and it even spat out protective precious techniques to defend itself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, everything was too late. That lightning hacked down like blade radiance, slicing through its precious artifacts and penetrating its armor, severing its body at the waist. Blood flew everywhere.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finally, with a&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">hong</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;sound, the lightning power exploded. This supreme expert realm silver lizard was blasted apart and turned into ashes.&nbsp;</span></p>

Shi Hao was extremely satisfied. He followed the heavenly river deeper inwards.&nbsp;</span></p>

After cultivating for a period of time, he would travel for some time. He stayed close to the heavenly river where the lightning power was rich. This was an excellent place for cultivating lightning symbols.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During this cultivation trip, he would alternate between walking and stopping. Each time he sat down, he would take out that strange golden grass to study the symbols inside. His benefits were tremendous.</span></p>

However, it possessed some mysterious patterns, which, based on his suspicions, should be the damaged symbols of the immortal dao lightning from back then that scattered itself across Fiend Island. This stalk of grass should have absorbed some of it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That rock belongs to me,” said the divine striking stone.&nbsp;</span></p>

It took root within a head sized strange stone. There were similarly lightning symbols inside. The two were connected together, shining like a blazing sun.&nbsp;</span></p>

Even though these symbols aren’t complete and are quite damaged, there are still extremely deep mysteries inside,” said Shi Hao. His feat of breaking through the limitations of the Suan Ni precious technique had a deep connection to this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In addition, he believed that once he ate this grass and experienced the cleansing of the damaged immortal dao patterns inside, his flesh would become more intimate with lightning, and his precious technique would also improve greatly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This curse is truly unbearable!” The divine striking stone was quite angry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The most terrifying part of moving along the heavenly river weren’t attacks from those vicious beasts, but instead the curse power. This type of thing was formless and difficult to defend against.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was also the reason why even though everyone knew the immortal tomb laid at the end of the long river, the sect masters still couldn’t get closer.&nbsp;</span></p>

Once one became infected by it, if they couldn’t get rid of it, it would quickly make one weak, ultimately eradicating one’s dao foundation and causing their flesh to collapse.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rumors had it that there was a higher realms giant that died because of this. It immediately left many experts alarmed, no longer daring to investigate this place.&nbsp;</span></p>

The more powerful one is, the more they would feel it,” Shi Hao said softly. This was something he learned from others after arriving in Fiend Island.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps normal people wouldn’t feel much, but how could they defend themselves against the vicious beasts along the way? They wouldn’t be able to move a single step.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao travelled another eight hundred li, and then he felt that the pressure was too great. This curse was extremely terrifying. It left patterns on the surface of his body that were sinister and strange.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Shi Hao could still defend against it and continuously eradicate it. However, he still felt a type of pressure.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He previously defeated against Immortal Palace’s curse, so he wasn’t scared of this type of mysterious power. He had a bit of knowledge from his experience when dealing with it, so he continued to press forward.</span></p>
