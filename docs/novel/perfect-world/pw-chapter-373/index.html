 <p><b>Chapter 373 - Battle Between the Stone Clan Brothers</b></p>
 <p><span style>The Archaic Vermillion Bird’s Four-Fold Barrage versus the Qilin technique; these two individuals fought until the entire sky became muddled and dim. Everything was covered in a hazy fog, and all types of figures flickered about.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With the great battle reaching this stage, all types of strange sights appeared. It was as if ancient monsters crawled out from hell. Figures appeared everywhere, and weeping sounds filled the battlefield. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Those figures could clearly be seen around those two individuals. From time to time, they would throw themselves outwards and even threaten those two individuals.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When everyone saw this, they all became alarmed. Soon after, some of them became horrified. Their brows creased, as if they thought of something. In a trembling voice, someone asked, “Could it be that the legends are true?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“On the deity-level battlefield, those that passed away were all history’s most outstanding heroes. Their battle souls are almost immortal, and even though their bodies died, their resentment and unwillingness will reappear when great battles like these unfold. These souls will then join in.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When this rumor was brought up, it immediately raised an uproar. Many people began to mutter, and brilliant lights shone from within their eyes as they watched those figures carefully. They felt a wave of numbness brush past their scalps. </span></p>
 <p><span style>In the distant past, in an entirely different era, just how many outstanding talents like Shi Yi and Shi Hao had died here? </span></p>
 <p><span style>Without a doubt, if nothing unusual happened, one among Shi Yi and Shi Hao would join their ranks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they thought of this possibility, everyone sucked in a cold breath of air. Just the thought of a spirit of such an outstanding talent was scary. They truly possessed the aptitude to overlook the world!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Aowu…</span></i><span style> A malicious spirit with dishevelled hair threw itself at Shi Yi. Its entire body was covered in scales, and its tyrannical aura penetrated one’s bones. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peng</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Yi released a cold snort. While he fought against his opponent, he swept a leg onto this figure’s claw, bringing forth a dazzling light. The void figure scattered and disappeared. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“They have substance?!” Upon seeing this, everyone felt their hair stand up straight. This… when they confirmed their suspicions, they realized that this truly could disturb the great battle. These were ancient heroic spirits.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Shi Hao also encountered an attack, moreover two at once. There was a green luan and a flame python. The green bird’s body was like green gold, flickering with cold luster. The scarlet python’s body was like flames as it erupted with blazing multicolored light. They both attacked him, one in front and one in the back. </span></p>
 <p><span style>This made him suspicious. Could it be that it was because he killed these types of creatures before in the real world that he encountered these strange things here?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Hao remained fearless. These weren’t actually living creatures in the end; rather, they were those that were defeated in the ancient era. They had died a long time ago, so their power had long been extinguished. The amount of strength they could display was limited. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>His entire body erupted with the Vermillion Bird’s fiery light as he rushed forward with ‘yang’ force. With a </span><i><span style>hong</span></i><span style> sound, two ancient spirits were set aflame like torches. They eventually turned into ashes. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Dang</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>In the next instant, Shi Yi’s palm became purple, upon which an ancient symbol appeared. A powerful divine might was stirred. The shining palms and fingers slammed over, and over ten purple Qilins appeared. </span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a fatal blow, a forbidden magic of the Qilin technique. Rumor has it that if it was perfect and used by the ancestral Qilin, then it would be able to crush an army of devils and gods! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Hao’s movements were imposing. He quickly rushed over without any sign of retreating. Scarlet symbols flickered about his body, making him as strong as a human form Vermillion Bird. Following a long roar, he released his violent attack. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t put on any defenses and instead utilized the Archaic Vermillion Bird’s Four-Fold Barrage to its limit to fight against Shi Yi. A sonorous sound reverberated throughout this area as soon as the two made contact. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Dang</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Two palms, one flickering with purple multicolored light, sparkling and translucent, and the other glistening and bright red like blood, ferociously collided. The sky would burst with explosions from time to time, as if this place was going to burst. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“So powerful!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone gasped. This kind of confrontation was just too terrifying. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Dang, qiang...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>When these two met, it would sound like a divine drum was beating. It was as if the sounds of weapons being refined in the heavens were ringing. That kind of resounding noise transmitted through everyone’s bones and into their souls. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone became dizzy from watching them. As those two individuals flew about, their hearts undulated up and down quickly. It gave them an extremely strange feeling. If a clan had just one supreme youth like this, that would be enough!</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, what these individuals couldn’t comprehend was that these were brothers that came from the same clan, yet they ended up fighting a battle to the death. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Yi swooped down from high up in the sky. Surrounding him were ten Qilins. He unleashed the most severe decisive attack, and the aura around his entire being became utterly terrifying!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pair of palms seemed to be pushing a roulette of life and death as they smashed towards Shi Hao. This was known as the Qilin wheel during the archaic years, and any individual caught under it would not even be left with a skeleton. </span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the first time Shi Hao’s expression changed. His fiery red body quickly shifted, avoiding his opponent’s most powerful attack. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The older youth’s Qilin killing blow brushed past and landed on the faintly golden battlefield. With a </span><i><span style>hong</span></i><span style> sound, this place was smashed open. It almost seemed as if a great crater was going to be formed. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone was overwhelmed with horror. The sky battlefield was being destroyed? The dual-pupiled individual was just too powerful! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Yi’s Qiling wheel smashed into the golden cornerstone, but it did not sink any further. His body was flexible and strong, allowing him to quickly stop. One hand propped up the ground, and his body stabilized. He then attacked in all directions. </span></p>
 <p><span style>With a </span><i><span style>peng</span></i><span style> sound, stones flew about everywhere. The golden cornerstone was shattered, and the body that swept out was almost invincible. It was like a whip as it smashed towards Shi Hao. </span></p>
 <p><span style>There were ten Qilins around him the entire time. This was the same as having the body of a Qilin, allowing him to have an incomparably powerful strength. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Hao’s eyes released a cold glint. His essence energy was surging, and with a skillful leap, he soared high into the air. He then ferociously stamped down on Shi Yi’s body. </span></p>
 <p><span style>This strike was incredibly efficient and ruthless. Imposing and direct!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hu...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A frantic gale appeared, whistling through the heaven and earth. The golden cornerstone below cracked apart and was stirred into the air. Shi Yi was like a spinning top as he slightly spun around. He then rushed towards the sky after barely avoiding Shi Hao’s feet. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, he took this chance to quickly make his own move. The Qilin steps emerged, and he once again stepped forward continuously. Each step made the entire world resonate. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hong, hong...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>This time, he directly took eight steps towards Shi Hao. It was more terrifying than last time, causing his blood to surge and flow out from his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, a divine wheel appeared within Shi Yi’s hands. This was a divine wheel that could suppress and kill gods and devils! It had reappeared and was directly smashed over. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Hao quickly backed off, avoiding this killing blow. </span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Shi Yi’s legs were extremely quick. The sleeves of his immortal clothes fluttered about, and his arms seemed like they propped up the sky. The divine wheel quickly smashed down with incomparable force. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hong</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He suddenly tossed it outwards. The Qiling wheel flew out and almost smashed into Shi Hao. It flew for an extremely long distance. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ten or so railings were destroyed, leaving the sky battlefield in a terrible state. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Just when everyone had thought that the confrontation had finally eased a bit, another intense confrontation erupted. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Hao’s eyes narrowed. He had just avoided the Qilin wheel and earned a breather, yet the opposing Shi Yi’s two arms reached out, as if they were trying to slice his opponent at the waist. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Hao suddenly raised his hand. He also hacked them outwards to slice off Shi Yi’s head. </span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Shi Yi suddenly kicked over. It was just too fast. His right leg kicked out in reverse like a scorpion tail, ferocious and accurate. The attack was forceful and severe. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Within the </span><i><span style>wuwu</span></i><span style> sounds, ten Qilins appeared. The leg arrived as fast as lightning. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peng</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Hao quickly moved backwards, and the ten Qilins almost brushed past his body. They did not make contact with his body, but the scorpion tail-like reverse kick struck him in the shoulder. </span></p>
 <p><span style>This kick contained all of Shi Yi’s spiritual essence and an incomparable amount of divine force. This strike was extremely fierce and accurate, just like his natural character. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Even a piece of divine gold would be deformed from this kick or even fracture, because this attack was just too powerful. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Hao was blasted backwards, and a string of blood flew out of his mouth. He sighed inwardly. This time, he had been a bit careless. His opponent really was the strongest he had ever faced. His attacks were too powerful, and his methods were too fierce. He was extremely experienced and far more disciplined than the others. </span></p>
 <p><span style>His shoulder was in intense pain. The spot that was hit was red and swollen, and his bones had released a loud sound. Symbols were flickering about violently. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not good, the younger one’s shoulder had been broken by the kick!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone cried out in alarm and widened their eyes. Was this battle finished?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even the supreme experts sitting within their war chariots stood up. Their eyes flickered with radiance as they stared into the Sky Battlefield. They were all stirred up. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shi Yi is formidable after all.” Grandma Xihua was all smiles as she stood next to fairy Yue Chan. She was full of praise. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Worthy of being Peerless Lord, number one under the heavens!” Next to the large spider, there were a few individuals who sighed in praise. They all nodded in agreement. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Father, he… is going to lose? Is there any way to save him?” Within the raging flames, Huo Ling’er revealed a worried expression as she pleaded with the Fire Emperor. </span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, all of these creatures had their eyes on the battlefield. Many of them felt that this battle was most likely over. The sound of bones cracking was too loud. With a broken arm, what battle was there left?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little brother, you have to be careful!” Shi Yi spoke with a callous type of mockery. </span></p>
 <p><span style>As he spoke, a streak of purple lightning flew out. He already had the advantage, so as long as he made the first move and grabbed all opportunities, then the other side was definitely going to be killed. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A </span><i><span style>hong</span></i><span style> sound rang out. Shi Yi’s power flourished even greater as he surged with a heavenly might. His palms and fingers formed a disk as they smashed towards his opponent. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Hao’s eyes blazed with streaks of radiance. He did not back off, and instead pushed forward. His entire body blazed with the Vermillion Bird’s flames, as if they could destroy the nine heavens. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is he mad? Is he going to give up that arm and try to end it with heavy injuries on both sides?” Many people became astonished. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The arm that had been injured was raised to meet this attack. His other hand was aimed towards Shi Yi’s head. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Yi,</span></i><span style> something’s not right!” In the next moment, everyone widened their eyes. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Yi was also horrified. He felt a sense of danger, as if something was greatly wrong. </span></p>
 <p><span style>An earsplitting fracturing sound rang out. Shi Hao’s seemingly flabby arm suddenly snapped straight, instantly returning to its powerful form as it smashed towards the enemy’s neck. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just now, it wasn’t that his arm broke, but rather that the joint was dislocated! What a powerful body, to actually not be injured!” The Fire Emperor sitting on the carriage sighed in admiration. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Only when he pointed this out did everyone suddenly understand. They then all became incomparably shocked. Just how terrifying was his body? He was unaffected even after being hit by such a great killing blow!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>In the next moment, Shi Hao burst into the form of a Vermillion Bird. He attacked violently and occupied the upper hand. He unleashed his thunderous rage. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peng</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Yi’s fist smashed towards Shi Hao’s forehead, but in the end, it was blocked by his opponent’s intersecting arms. Following a spin of Shi Hao’s body, his legs continuously trampled outwards. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The attack was just like a barrage of images. The soles of his feet were scarlet like blood and sharp like the cutting edge of a blade. Shi Hao’s movements were as fast as lightning. He shifted above Shi Yi and continuously trampled downwards. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peng</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, Shi Yi flew outwards. His chest was trampled on, causing him to cough out large amounts of blood. His chest caved in, and it was clear that there were broken bones. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Again!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Hao’s body boiled with essence energy. Scarlet multicolored lights surged like flames as he swooped over again. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heavens, the younger one is too powerful! Just now, he had negligently received a blow, but now, he is acting viciously, causing Shi Yi to suffer an injury!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The sides have completely turned around! The older brother is in danger!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as everyone was shouting, the battle changed again. Shi Hao used the Archaic Vermillion Bird’s Four-Fold Barrage to its limit. Even if a real Vermillion Bird appeared, it wouldn’t seem as tyrannical as this one!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He continuously released attacks, causing flames to overflow into the heavens. His palms were like scarlet jade as they endlessly battered Shi Yi. With a </span><i><span style>peng</span></i><span style> sound, he once again rushed towards Shi Yi, making his head release a crisp sound. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Yi’s shoulder had been injured, and he was sent flying once again. Blood was coughed out from his mouth. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The large golden spider’s face went rigid, and the Demonic Spirit Lake’s creatures’ expressions all became gloomy. Everyone darkened their faces. They were passionately debating just now, thinking that the fate of the battle had been decided, yet the result now took a full hundred and eighty degrees turn. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“This younger stone descendant is so powerful!” Grandma Xihua’s expression changed as she muttered. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Hao moved through the air with swiftness, as if he was a Vermillion Bird destroying the stars of the universe!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Break!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Yi released a low groan. His right eye shot out a beam of dark light, making the entire Sky Battlefield tremble. The entire world exploded, and heaven itself seemed like it was going to collapse. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So terrifying!” Everyone was greatly shaken. Their eyes widened as they watched with disbelief. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The great battle had reached its climax. The dual-pupiled individual finally used his forbidden divine ability. This was the natural ability granted to him by the heavens, known to be invincible during the ancient years. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Could Shi Hao endure this? Everyone held their breaths. </span></p>
