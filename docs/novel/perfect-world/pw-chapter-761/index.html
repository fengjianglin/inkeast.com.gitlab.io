His talent was exceptional.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In addition, one has to understand that the Celestial Clan used to be an unmatched Emperor Clan. Just how powerful was an exceptional talent that came from this ancient sect? It was unfathomable!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The most important thing was that he merged with the heaven’s mandate stone, which was equivalent to a type of transcendence. He could overlook all of his peers!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Correct, brother You Yu should be coming,” Kun Mo said. His face revealed a faint smile that was a bit aloof. After all, You Yu’s name was well known in all directions. When the geniuses from these various sects heard this, their expressions all changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was the descendant of an Emperor Race, merged with the heaven’s mandate stone, and was even an ‘exceptional talent’, so many people predicted that You Yu’s future accomplishments would most likely surpass that of the archaic six great celestials!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sooner or later, this would become one of the taboo existences that ruled the higher realms!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother You Yu is exceptional, and I have long heard of him. If I ever get the chance to meet him, it would truly be an honor.” Someone praised, seeing the Celestial Clan’s heavenly genius quite favorably.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Right, I heard that brother You Yu already started to evolve his unique precious technique, and that it was absolutely stunning. When the time comes, I definitely have to ask him for guidance.” Someone added.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The others all nodded as well, speaking praise.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I heard that the noble lady heavenly genius Yun Xi’s appearance is exceptional, her appearance like a flower. Now that she merged with the heaven’s mandate stone, she powerful rose up. Celestial Clan really is a place where heroes emerge!” Another person said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Regardless of whether it was the Nine-Headed Snake Race, Oblique Moon Ancient Cave, or the others, even though they were all top level powers, they still felt a type of reverence for this past Emperor Clan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Everyone, you all believe that with how outstanding senior brother You Yu is, he is enough to suppress that so-called youth Huang, right?” Kun Mo said. He had felt a lack of confidence this entire time after being questioned by Qing Yi. Now, he brought up this question again with confidence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Quite a few people agreed, praising You Yu’s name. He made quite a few people feel restraining fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, there were some whose mouths revealed meaningful smiles, not expressing anything. They had heard secret information. This Huang was definitely not simple!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yue Chan smiled faintly, graceful and pure. “I hope he is even more great than his reputation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who are you?” Kun Mo asked. He was quite discontent with this woman, actually questioning him again and again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“She is my junior sister Qing Yi.” At this moment, Feng Wu spoke. She was dressed in golden clothes that contained a type of spirituality. There was also a type of domineering confidence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as she spoke, everyone attached great importance to her words. It was because she was Goddess Academy’s number one genius, the chosen inheritor. Not only was she ridiculously powerful herself, she would also be the one controlling the academy in the future.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu,</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;junior sister Feng Wu was previously invited to enter Origin Sky Secret Realm, so you should understand a bit more about that young devil king Huang, the one that has the greatest right to speak. What is he really like? Is he strong or not?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Someone asked. Even though it was asked rather absent-mindedly and quite casually, this was clearly calling Celestial Clan’s words into question.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the others heard this, they also paid attention, wishing to know what happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I didn’t fight with him.” Feng Wu said. She acted quite earnest here, because she had to represent the sect. Back then when she fought with Shi Hao on the Copper Sparrow Alter, she definitely didn’t act like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Kun Mo heard this, he revealed a smile and said, “We already said that this person has an underserved reputation. If senior sister Feng Wu took action, she would definitely easily surpress him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feng Wu gave him a look and then said, “I know about his accomplishments. He killed Underworld Child, Sun God Vine, and even cooked the Purple Golden Hou Race’s genius in a cauldron, directly eating it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When these words were spoken, the smile on Kun Mo’s face directly froze. This was the same as giving him a huge slap to the face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One has to understand that all three that Feng Wu mentioned were exceptional talents, yet they all died while nursing grievances. This type of battle accomplishment was enough to prove Huang’s powerful strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many people revealed looks of surprise. They looked at Kun Mo, feeling embarrassed for him. This really was hard to take.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior sister Feng Wu is just telling things as it is. Also, didn’t this information spread throughout the outside world for a while already?” Yue Chan, who was currently Qing Yi, calmly said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Everyone, let’s just end it here. I am going to cultivate in isolation.” Feng Wu stood up. She nodded towards Qing Yi with a smile, and then she left.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone stood up as well. They all knew that she was a well known exceptional talent, and right now she was comprehending the Human Immortal engravings, so time was precious. She wanted to rise up in the battle of three thousand provinces!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though the remaining sect elites didn’t scatter, they lacked the enthusiasm to talk further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, there was disorder within the academy, and even the experts in the palace could sense it. They couldn’t help but reveal looks of shock.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What happened?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The disciple of that shoddy mountain gate wounded the academy’s senior brothers!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soon after, everyone roughly understood what happened. They were immediately interested, heading outwards to learn of the details.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What kind of person is this, to dare provoke Goddess Academy? What is he treating this place as? Is he looking down on this ancient inheritance?” Kun Mo said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had a faint smile on his face. He was called into question in the palace just now, so he felt like he lost quite a bit of face. Now that something was happening, he began to sneer and take joy in the calamity of others.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soon after, he couldn’t laugh any longer, because even though they were all injured, they could still stand. Only the Celestial Clan’s person was carried back, his bones broken and muscles severed, teeth all knocked out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who dares?!” He couldn’t help but shout out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were countless celestial race’s people, and there were disciples that went to other great sects to cultivate, but deep down, they were of the same race. There were quite a few who, after their studies, returned to the clan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Someone spoke up and asked a few question. Meanwhile, the Celestial Race disciple was even more sullen, telling Kun Mo that after that person found out he was of the Celestial Race, he purposely ‘took care’ of him a bit better.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Even the disciple of a small shoddy sect dares to do this, provoking our Celestial Clan? Does he not want to live any longer?!” Kun Mo’s face fell. They were one of the higher realms’ great clans, and others normally wouldn’t dare confront them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He was quite unhappy in the palace to begin with, and now he encountered this type of thing, so he was naturally angered. “Where is he? I am going to that sect to demand an explanation!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Kun Mo had this type of confidence. After all, he did have the reputation of being one of the Celestial Race’s six heroes. If it was just a small sect, he believed that even though their sect elders would be stronger than him, they would still have second thoughts, eventually welcoming him with a smiling face. After all, he represented the Celestial Clan.</span></p>

He wanted to explain something.&nbsp;</span></p>

The Celestial Clan was one of the most powerful inheritances, and as one of the six great heroes, he naturally looked down on most of his peers.&nbsp;</span></p>

Recently, it produced another disciple.” One of Goddess Academy’s wounded senior brothers said.</span></p>

Where would one find the scene of a sect? This was clearly a part of the wilderness.&nbsp;</span></p>

What kind of rotten place was this? For this kind of small sect to injure his clansmen, it was simply an enormous humiliation!</span></p>

At the mountain gate, a tattered decorated archway still managed to stand. As for the other places, there was debris everywhere. Weeds flourished everywhere.</span></p>

He was forced by that old man to carry a large mountain crazily on his back, tiring him half to death, and now that he came back, he still couldn’t get any peace and quiet, meeting someone who spoke to him like this. How could he tolerate this?</span></p>
