The most powerful one was an old servant from ‘Immortal Hall’. His individual strength was equal to the joint power of four experts with their divine flames lit.&nbsp;</span></p>

Unfortunately, there was less than a tenth of the three deities’ consciousness remaining, so Shi Hao couldn’t find out everything.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The second strongest expert came from Western Sect, a deity with the Vajra Unbreakable BodyHe cultivated the zhang six golden body to an extremely high level, and he also grasped several great divine abilities.&nbsp;</span></p>

The situation was grim. The remaining four deities were even more terrifying and difficult to deal with. Exactly how was he supposed to fight them?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Even if I become a deity and use the imperishable golden body battle clothes to improve my strength, it’ll still only be enough to deal with a single deity, and even then it would be hard to say who will come out ahead.” He said to himself while frowning.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After igniting his divine flame, it was equal to transcending the category of humanity. The power of mortals wasn’t enough to oppose them. This type of increase in power was much greater than the difference between the other great cultivation realms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was obvious that he could only use the Western Tomb world this one time. A similar method wouldn’t work. There is no way the remaining four deities would repeat this disastrous mistake.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What should I do? Is there really no other way?” Shi Hao said softly. How was he supposed to break out from this hopeless situation? His mind was heavy, feeling a type of ominous premonition. Could it be that something unexpected was going to happen to him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He left Western Beast Mountain and flew towards Stone Country Capital.</span></p>

They deduced the locations of several areas containing natural luck in the lower realm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though the exact points couldn’t be determined, an approximate range was drawn out!</span></p>

This type of information was priceless, but right now, it was useless to Shi Hao. The most important thing was surviving and somehow ridding himself of this crisis.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, it was just too hard. It was just impossible to do right now.&nbsp;</span></p>

He descended into a small town to find out a bit about the current imperial capital first.&nbsp;</span></p>

There were no disturbances, as if there hadn’t been any battles and none of that happened at all. The more he found out that things were like this, the more Shi Hao frowned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yi?</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">” Suddenly, he saw a young lady, one that looked extremely familiar. Even though she wore simple and plain clothes, there was an aloof and spiritual aura around her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Inside of that small town, the young lady seemed to have sensed something. She turned around and saw him, revealing a look of shock. She covered her mouth with her hands and said, “It’s you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao recalled that this was Yu Zimo, someone he had seen in the Hundred Shattering Mountains. She was one of the Rain Clan’s two heros and had a rare innate spirituality. She could predict a bit of the future.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the Rain Clan was destroyed, Shi Hao didn’t eradicate every last one of their members. Towards a few women, children, and elders, he let them go, allowing them to leave. This girl hadn’t been in the clan that day, so she naturally avoided disaster.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Zimo lowered her heads, and after a moment, she suddenly raised her head and walked over. “If you want to kill me, then just do it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You can go.” Shi Hao spoke. He frowned, not paying any attention to this. His mind was on how to deal with the four deities.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, Yu Zimo staggered backwards, and a crack appeared between her brows. A strand of blood flowed out. When she looked at Shi Hao, her face became filled with shock and confusion.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was clear that she had encountered a bitter experience. She looked at Shi Hao and said, “I peered into the future and only saw primal chaos. When I turned around, behind your body was an expanse of nothingness.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they met again, she once again made this type of prediction. It was the same as the time in Hundred Shattering Mountains.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Shi Hao heard this, he raised his head and looked at her. “What do you mean?” This wasn’t the first time he heard this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t know.” Yu Zimo wiped away the trace of blood from her forehead and said, “You… don’t seem to be a part of this collection of ancient history. Perhaps, you… will completely vanish from this world.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it really was the latter, then Shi Hao understood, because he could die at anytime. As for the former, he was completely confused. He waved his hand and directly left for the distance. He didn’t have the time to think too much about this stuff now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao returned to Stone Capital silently. The palace hall was cold and cheerless. The spirits of the guards were down, but there were no deities hiding here.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Peng Nine!” Then, Shi Hao saw Peng Nine in an imperial manor outside the city. He was hiding here to recover his injuries. Fortunately, his life wasn’t in danger.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your Majesty… you are still alive!” Peng Nine was shocked. He wasn’t the only one. Everyone in the imperial palace felt that Shi Hao was doomed to die, passing away prematurely.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Who would have expected that he was still alive, safely returning! Peng Nine’s eyes were opened wide, and he was so excited he didn’t know what to say.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then, when the War King, Ming King, and the others received news, they all rushed over. Some of them began to tremble, feeling incomparable joy. Being able to see Shi Hao again was simply a miracle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He led away three deities and dealt with them alone, yet he was actually able to live. Could it be that those three experts were all dead? When they thought of this possibility, it felt as if their hearts were about to jump out from their throats.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your Majesty, you… killed them?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They are all dead.” Shi Hao smiled and said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These people were all shocked, and then their expressions immediately became brilliant. Several of them were so inspired they began to tremble.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Where is Qingfeng?” Shi Hao asked. He didn’t see him here.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he mentioned this question, several individuals’ expressions darkened.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao didn’t care about his own safety and guided the three deities away. This made Qingfeng’s heart burn with worry and anxiety. Fearing that Shi Hao would die, he departed through the altar to invite experts to rescue him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was clear that Qingfeng went to Stone Village to invite Hairy Ball and Little Red.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was also during this time that two things happened. The first was another deity came to see Yang Li, pangolin, and underworld deity. They just happened to run into Hairy Ball and Little Red, directly leading to a great battle that continued into the great wastelands.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the results, they still didn’t know!</span></p>

It was as if it was trying to open the Ancient Holy Courtyard.&nbsp;</span></p>

Hairy Ball and Little Red still ended up coming! They had just lit their divine flames, so they were still far from being comparable to the seven deities. If they fought like this, it was quite likely that they would die.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he didn’t blame Qingfeng. That gentle and weak youth was too angry, fearing that he would die, so he did everything he could to save him in spite of the consequences.&nbsp;</span></p>

The divine flame that burned around him was especially resplendent,” Peng Nine replied.&nbsp;</span></p>

From the three deities, he learned that the western sect’s expert that lit his divine flame was ranked second.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An hour later, Shi Hao rushed towards those mountain depths. He saw collapsed mountain ridges and great earth that had been turned into cooled magma. There was a deathly stillness.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he looked around, he saw scarlet feathers that were dyed in blood everywhere. They belonged to Little Red!</span></p>

They belonged to Hairy Ball!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao felt his eye sockets splitting. His blood surged within him, and his hair flew everywhere. Everything was as he had predicted; the two of them had fell. He even saw a piece of a scorched Vermilion Bird wing, as well as a piece of Hairy Ball’s bones that carried golden hair and blood. This proved that those two powerful individuals had most likely died.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ah…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Shi Hao howled, crying out like a wounded wild beast. He couldn’t accept this result.&nbsp;</span></p>

He brought Hairy Ball back with him when he was young. It accompanied him as he grew up, so the feelings between them were extremely great. Meanwhile, even though Little Red’s mouth was rather noisy, its relationship with Stone Village was definitely great, helping out and protecting that place.&nbsp;</span></p>

How were they supposed to fight now, especially with Western Sect expert being the second most powerful one. He was more powerful than Yang Li, pangolin, and the underworld deity combined!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao seemed to have gone mad as he searched everywhere. He once again saw Hairy Ball’s broken bones and fur that was stuck together with blood. He noticed the other part of Little Red’s broken wing. This made him wish to go insane. He raised his head towards the heavens and roared.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao cried. This was the first time he had ever felt so heartbroken. Ever since he left Stone Village, he had always advanced happily and fearlessly, sweeping through all of his opponents. He had never experienced a disaster like this.&nbsp;</span></p>

In the Void God Realm, he was the devilish child that angered humans and gods alike. He had always forcefully pushed through his enemies and rarely encountered opponents.&nbsp;</span></p>

Right now, Shi Hao weeped and sobed, crawling on the ground while stroking Hairy Ball’s ruined bones and fur and carrying Little Red’s wing. He was absolutely heartbroken.&nbsp;</span></p>

He felt helpless, as well as incomparable grief and indignation.&nbsp;</span></p>

He carefully opened up a passage, and then he erased all traces. Only then did he rush in, heading towards Stone Village.&nbsp;</span></p>

However, right now, he was overwhelmed with grief. He found it hard to breath right now, and his mind was about to go into flames.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as he returned, he heard the sounds of crying. Many children were rubbing their tears, and a few grown men also revealed looks of sadness. All of Stone Village was incomparably depressed.&nbsp;</span></p>

He saw Qingfeng kneeling on the ground while crying loudly. There was a coffin there, indicating that things were bad.&nbsp;</span></p>

Everyone turned around to look at him, and they were immediately stupefied, Qingfeng even more so jumped up and carefully stared at his face.&nbsp;</span></p>

He then saw Hairy Ball and Little Red. All of his sadness immediately changed to great joy. He immediately cried out loudly.&nbsp;</span></p>

The two of them suffered severe injuries. Hairy Ball was completely missing the lower half of its body, while Little Red’s wings had been torn off. They were in extremely miserable conditions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, as long as these two were alive, none of these injuries were a problem. For creatures with their divine flames lit, their recovery powers were extremely great. Sooner or later, they would be able to grow everything back.&nbsp;</span></p>

That golden body was too powerful. We couldn’t fight against it at all,” said Hairy Ball. It grimaced in pain from the injuries covering its body. Even its foundation had been damaged.&nbsp;</span></p>

There wasn’t a single area that was undamaged, and even its primordial symbol bone had cracks. This was extremely serious. These two wouldn’t be able to recover without a year or two at the least.&nbsp;</span></p>

I have the Sun God Tree’s divine liquid here, one for each of you. You’ll be fine in half a year!” Shi Hao said. He brought out a jade container and gave each of them a drop.&nbsp;</span></p>

This didn’t seem to make sense at all. What did Hairy Ball and Little Red have that could fight against the second powerful deity? The disparity between them was too great!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We used Stone Village’s ancestral artifacts,” said Hairy Ball.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Stone Village had two ancestral artifacts. One was a piece of bone, and the other was a beast skin. This time, Hairy Ball and Little Red used these two ancient artifacts. They broke through the seals on these artifacts, and they ended up being even more powerful than the two true divine magical artifacts from Stone Country.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao was stupefied. “Even if that is the case, that person should still be extremely difficult to kill, right?”</span></p>

We had just lit our divine flames, while that Western Sect expert had already had his ignited for over a hundred years. He was extremely powerful, his strength being far greater than others his level.” Little Red nodded.&nbsp;</span></p>

At the crucial moment, the cauldron displayed a miracle. Its defensive strength was astonishing, and hiding within it could avoid more than ninety percent of the damage.&nbsp;</span></p>

This cauldron really was mysterious. He always felt that it was unordinary, but he didn’t expect that not only could it refine precious medicine, it actually possessed such astonishing offensive strength as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao truly didn’t think that the number two expert of the seven deities would be dealt with like this.&nbsp;</span></p>

That cauldron was extremely mysterious. After releasing the pill flame and easily burning Western Sect’s expert to death, it then disappeared under fiery light.&nbsp;</span></p>

It could vaguely see the scene of a white bone cauldron disappearing in the fiery light.</span></p>
