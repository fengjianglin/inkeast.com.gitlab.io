Spiritual herbs could be seen everywhere, and strand after strand of spiritual essence swirled about.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The valley only occupied a small region, and there was a divine formation protecting it. Shi Hao stood in front of, looking at the divine king’s inscription, the heavenly deity’s inscription, and many others. They covered the surface of an enormous stone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a secret place. There were many experts that came here. Some of them died in a seated posture, some were killed in battle, and others left for the higher realms.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It seems like there are many, but it has been accumulating since the archaic era. Many outstanding heroes have been buried under the passage of time,” said the elder. His name was Qin Fa, and he has cultivated the dao for two hundred years. He had already been a supreme expert for several dozen years.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao nodded and chatted with him. He wanted to know when the valley was going to open up again and how long he had to wait for. The sky was already becoming dim, but there was no activity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It should be soon, two days at the latest. It will definitely open.” Qin Fa said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao felt the rich spiritual essence in this place. This was the case even outside the valley, so one could well imagine what it was like inside. Worldly spiritual essence would definitely roil like a sea, with its best parts sealed within by great formations.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His parents were cultivating inside. Why didn’t they come search for him? Shi Hao was a bit conflicted inwardly as he waited here in a rather depressed mood.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My father and mother have been here for more than ten years. Has everything gone well for them?” He tried to ask indirectly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Quite well, but they were always worrying about you. Only, they were cultivating a miraculous divine ability, so it was difficult for them to leave this valley.” Qin Fa smiled and said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao became silent. Soon after, he shook his head and remembered what happened before. The Willow Deity opened up his sea of consciousness before, allowing him to see his memories from the past. At that time, for his sake, his parents fought a great war against the Martial King Manor, flipping the clan upside down. They cherished him so greatly and definitely wouldn’t have ignored him like this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You all trapped my parents here?!” Shi Hao opened his mouth, and his gaze became a bit forceful.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He examined Qin Fa and said, “Don’t tell me that you guided me here to imprison the later generation as well?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Fa laughed and said, “Dealing with you is rather easy. After coming to my Immortal Mountain, if we truly wanted to make things difficult for you, as soon as the great formations are opened, even gods and devils can be slaughtered.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After speaking up to this point, he asked Shi Hao to sit down. There was a stone table and stone chairs here. It was near the valley, and the smell of medicinal fragrances wafted through the air. It made this place feel heavenly and peaceful.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What do you think about this place? It really is a delicate and beautiful place. Cultivating here will allow your cultivation to quickly advance.” Qin Fa said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You really want to imprison me here?” Shi Hao coldly spoke.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No, we are trying to help you.” Qin Fa shook his head and said, “You have to know that this world is imperfect. The natural laws are incomplete. If one continues to cultivate in such an environment, it would be greatly detrimental for them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao didn’t say anything and calmly looked at him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I want you to know that my Immortal Mountain is a place that seizes the natural force of this world. The great dao is not deficient in the valley, and the natural laws are perfectly intact. Cultivating here will allow your body to form a perfect dao core. In the future, you can then rise to the peak,” Qin Fa said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He expressed that if Shi Hao was willing, the Qin family would enthusiastically help him, allowing him to cultivate here long term until he reached the peak.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao remained silent. Even if this place was wonderful, he didn’t believe the Qin family really would treat him like this. You have to understand that there were intense conflicts between both sides.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Everything that happened before were just misunderstandings, so it isn’t something we can’t get over. You possess the supreme being bone, and you also have half our clan’s bloodline, so how could we not nurture you?” Qin Fa smiled.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I cannot leave. As Stone Country’s new emperor, there are things that I must take care of for now.” Shi Hao was beating around the bush.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No matter. You might not know this, but right now, you already have a younger brother, and his talents are similarly outstanding and exceptional in this world. He is already thirteen years of age. If you cultivate here, you can have him take your place in Stone Country’s Imperial Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao’s eyes burned brightly as he looked at Qin Fa, but he didn’t say anything.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he found it hard to calm down inside. This wasn’t the first time he heard this. Previously in Stone Capital, he had heard Qin Ling say that there was a young supreme being younger brother.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And now, he heard about it again. His father and mother had another child. If they were imprisoned here and couldn’t leave, then why did they want to release his younger brother?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Emotions were surging within his mind, and he found it hard to calm down. His mood was complex. He found it difficult to say a single thing for a long time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“One should fight together with his family. He is your own little brother, and his heavenly talents are truly frightening and enough to overlook this generation. With him representing your Stone Capital, what is there to be worried about?” Qin Fa said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For a long time, Shi Hao didn’t say anything. He already seemed to be a bit distracted. He had a younger brother already, so during these years, did his parents even think about him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unknowingly why, he suddenly developed a sour and bitter feeling. He depended on himself for more than ten years, struggling as he rose up in the great wastelands, sweeping through all of his enemies. He had never enjoyed the warmth of his parents.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yet now, a younger brother had suddenly appeared. He felt somewhat frustrated and at a loss. During these years, his parents had always protected his younger brother and never went to look for him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have a younger brother…” He said to himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Correct. He is talented, intelligent, and brave. If he goes to Stone Capital, he can definitely control everything. You need not worry.” Qin Fa said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Becoming the emperor of Stone Country, is this my little brother’s own wish?” Shi Hao asked in a stupefied manner.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He has his own aspirations. His journey of cultivation was not always within the valley. He has also departed on a long term self-grinding journey before, and he wishes to mature in an even higher position to improve his understanding of the world’s great dao,” Qin Fa said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Younger brother wants my position of emperor…” Shi Hao said to himself. He sank into a state of silence for a long time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He doesn’t want to steal your title of Emperor, and instead wishes that you can cultivate here, using this divine land to produce a perfect dao core. Apart from this, your father and mother miss you dearly. You can have a reunion here. After being apart for so many years, I believe you wish to enjoy that type of familial warmth, right?” Qin Fa asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He looked at the quiet Shi Hao whose expression was a bit distracted and said, “Your natural talents are exceptional, and we truly wish to push you towards the peak. In the future, you can enter the higher realms and look down on everyone around you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You all are just scheming against my Stone Country and playing with my younger brother within your palms.” Shi Hao spoke. His expression was distracted, but his words were calm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He clearly understood the other party’s objectives. Even though he felt bitter inwardly, he was still aware of everything. At this moment, the Immortal Mountain still hadn’t given up on the wasteland region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Fa denied Shi Hao’s accusations and said, “How could that be? We just want you to form a perfect dao core so you could properly ascend to the peak, and by doing so, you could have a reunion with you parents as well. In addition, your brother can’t stay outside for too long. You all have to enter the higher realms in the future, so what is the imperial power of the lower realm worth?”</span></p>

Staring at Qin Fa, he asked, “Where is my grandfather?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He has entered the higher realms from this very valley.” Qin Fa calmly said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao’s expression was indifferent. He secretly used the ancient dual-pupil. That divine eye was always at his side, and even though it was damaged, it could still see through the fabrications nearby.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that instant, he actually felt a strange wave of energy. There were arrow holes in the walls of the valley. He was startled inwardly. That was left behind by a divine formation.&nbsp;</span></p>

After it was described to him by others, he could practically picture them in his mind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Extremely similar!” After reaching this conclusion, Shi Hao’s mind jumped, and then his eyes released killing intent.&nbsp;</span></p>

His right hand expanded and reached down like a Kun Peng, catching her and quickly pointed at the space between her brows to probe her sea of consciousness.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that instant, Shi Hao’s expression changed. He found a few special pieces of information in this maid’s sea of consciousness. There was a battle here two years ago, but as for what happened, the maid didn’t know.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You dare take advantage of my loved ones?!” Shi Hao erupted with fury. A wave of fire rose within him, and his gaze became forceful. He erupted with a powerful pressure.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he was young, his grandfather Shi Zhongtian went to find a pure-blooded creature for him to use for his baptism. In the end, he lost an arm and was pursued by a Pixiu.&nbsp;</span></p>

After finding out the changes that took place, all of Stone Capital was overturned, and two king manors were swept through.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It could be said that for Shi Hao’s sake, the price his grandfather paid was truly great. He doted greatly on him and showed incomparable concern. Shi Hao truly wanted to meet him immediately so that his grandfather could feel relieved. He wanted to tell his grandfather about his accomplishments in cultivation, how powerful he had become.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yet in the end, he found signs of his grandfather angrily firing arrows here. This gave him quite a few conflicting feelings.&nbsp;</span></p>

I can promise that he is in good health!” Qin Fa stood up.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, he took action. Even if it was the Immortal Mountain, he was still without fear. Ten heavenly passages opened, and his entire body shone. Divine force surged endlessly as it poured out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Fa released an indifferent smile and said, “Do not think that this is Stone Country Imperial Capital. There is no draconic energy, so how are you going to fight against me? Listen to me. Hurry and cease your aggression.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao remained fearless. The moment he took action, his entire body shone with dark light and clickered with cold luster. A black figure appeared, forming the imperishable battle clothes and merging with his body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Fa’s expression changed. He quickly backed up, but Shi Hao’s finger still reached his shoulder. With a&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">pu</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;sound, an explosion broke out and blood surged.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Supreme Expert Realm!” Qin Fa was extremely shocked, and then he looked at the black golden battle clothes. With a fiery gaze, he said, “An archaic era treasure! Even though it is damaged, there will be a day when it is repaired!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hong!</span></p>

Powerful force overflowed into the sky, and rays of light erupted as if there was a great sun floating in midair.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Fa backed up in retreat and did not face it head on. He sneered and said, “Youngster, you have to understand that this is the Immortal Mountain where even a deity has to kneel. You dare to act vicious here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“By taking advantage of my loved ones, war was inevitable!” Shi Hao’s black hair fluttered about.</span></p>

Even when the divine king descends into the lower realm, he still feels some restraining fear. What can a youngster like you do?” Qin Fa berated.&nbsp;</span></p>

After bullying my grandfather, I’ll even overturn the Immortal Mountain!” Shi Hao roared. His gaze was deep, and killing intent rushed into the heavens.&nbsp;</span></p>

He had researched the little Stone before. This youth would never put himself in a deadlock situation. However, he already entered the Immortal Mountain, so what other cards could he possibly play and how was he going to fight? Qin Fa felt rather uneasy.&nbsp;</span></p>
