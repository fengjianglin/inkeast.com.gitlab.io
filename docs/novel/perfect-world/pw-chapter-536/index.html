It possessed an indomitable spirit, as if it didn’t fear anything in this world. It was astonishingly powerful.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A fiery red vermilion bird was standing opposite of it.

In addition, the battlefield was a bit strange, because the mountain peaks that were destroyed were slowly recovering, and the magma was slowly disappearing.&nbsp;</span></p>

However, pure golden armor was covering her entire body, and only her eyes were exposed. Behind her were dozens to over a hundred scarlet multicolored divine swords. There were also several thousand swords around her that arranged themselves in the sky. They all flickered with multicolored radiance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sound of swords clashing rang through the sky. When she drew a sword, all of the scarlet swords vibrated. They produced endless scarlet light and hacked outwards together.&nbsp;</span></p>

It rushed forward valiantly, erupting with enough power to engage the endless fiery sword formation. Its size then shrunk, turning into a golden war god. With a flash, its body divided into thousands and tens of thousands of figures that rushed fiercely into the formation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Amazing!” Shi Hao sighed in admiration. Both individuals possessed incredible divine abilities as well as brilliant and varied precious techniques. Their attacks were full of different changes. This was definitely a battle worth watching.&nbsp;</span></p>

The battle was about to reach the crucial point, and the surging divine flames were an omen.&nbsp;</span></p>

You finally came back.” Qingfeng was extremely close to Shi Hao. He began to explain what happened while Shi Hao was gone. With the help of Willow Deity, Hairy Ball was able to fully recover, and when Stone Village moved, the big red bird brought Little Red back.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hairy Ball and the the fiery red bird started fighting as soon as they met, turning this area upside down. Even though it wasn’t a life and death struggle, they still fought almost every day.&nbsp;</span></p>

Qinfeng, Aunt Green Scaled Eagle, as well as the others like Dazhuang and Huzi even came over to learn and gain experience.&nbsp;</span></p>

It helped Hairy Ball revive, and it also baptised Green Scaled Eagle’s family, all for the sake of giving Stone Village enough strength to protect itself.&nbsp;</span></p>

Fiery flames poured outwards. A vicious bird swooped over domineeringly towards Shi Hao and cried out, “Do you dare fight against me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was over a hundred zhang in length. Dazzling scarlet multicolored light shone and li flames burned the skies. When it dove down like this, its power was truly great.&nbsp;</span></p>

He reached out a hand that continuously enlarged, and this hand eventually surrounded this vicious bird, forcing it to quickly shrink until it was only a foot or so in size. It fluttered about continuously inside of that hand, but it couldn’t escape.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It revealed its true appearance; this was precisely the big red bird. It was incredibly discouraged as it said, “I made the vermilion bird my master, yet I still can’t beat you…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone roared with laughter. It was acting all aggressive before as if no one could defeat it, yet now, its head was hanging dejectedly with a rather unresigned expression.&nbsp;</span></p>

Back then, he had thrown Big Red in Fire Nation’s ancestral land for it to become the vermilion bird’s disciple. It became much stronger as expected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Second Baldy didn’t come back?” Shi Hao asked.&nbsp;</span></p>

After their separation back then, it had never reappeared.&nbsp;</span></p>

Second Baldy Kong Qiuji was actually an extremely powerful supreme expert. His days of being bullied by the big red bird in Stone Village could only be considered his misfortune.&nbsp;</span></p>

Fire Nation, Celestial Race, and his other old friends had all left. This world now seemed a bit more lonely.&nbsp;</span></p>

A fist sized little golden monkey dropped onto a cliff. It shot Shi Hao a look of disdain with its piercing eyes. Its expression seemed to contain rather ill will.&nbsp;</span></p>

Yue Chan was greatly astonished, because no matter how she looked at it, this creature looked extremely similar to the one that fought a great battle against the zhang six golden body. They were both special Zhuyans with dragon horns. Could it be that this was its descendent?</span></p>

Shi Hao looked towards the ancient date tree that was winding about like a dragon. There was a bird’s nest here that he had never forgotten about. He had chased after that five-colored sparrow since he was a kid, but he had never caught it.&nbsp;</span></p>

She felt that this savage fellow was quite interesting during his childhood, quite different from what she previously thought of this enemy of hers.&nbsp;</span></p>

She had a brilliant smile on her face that was devastatingly beautiful, but right now, she was no longer the otherworldly, pure and holy woman as she asked the village’s youth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little Hao is quite interesting, even when he was three years old, he was still drinking milk…”</span></p>

Yue Chan no longer cared about her image as her beautiful figure continuously trembled, rocking back and forth from laughter. Her beautiful face was filled with joy as she took joy in Shi Hao’s disaster. This was the other side of the little Stone?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao was furious, and his face was completely red with embarrassment.

This question had left him stumped for many years, and he had always wanted to know about it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why should I tell you?” Little Red shot him a glare.

Who was the one that brought you to the Heaven Mending Sect so that you could eat spiritual medicines? Who was the one that brought you into the Kun Peng nest to visit the sea…” Shi Hao’s skin was extremely thick as he asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hairy Ball was extremely embarrassed. Even though it felt somewhat resentful towards this name, it had experienced so much with this youth, and those emotions were still deep and sincere.&nbsp;</span></p>

It’s a type of divine ability made especially for strengthening divine abilities. Once learned, it can assist all types of divine abilities, making all types of precious techniques become one. That… is something inconceivable!” Hairy Ball said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you know what taboo scriptures are?

There were all types of precious artifacts, tons of wine, and there were even Blue Dragon, Nine-Headed Snake, Purple Golden Ant, as well as other pure-blooded creatures. The meats were absolutely delicious and swirling with spiritual essence.&nbsp;</span></p>

Right now, he was like a simple and honest youth who was filled with expectations and dreams of exploration.&nbsp;</span></p>
