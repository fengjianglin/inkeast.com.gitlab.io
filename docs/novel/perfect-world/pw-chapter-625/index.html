His eyes were burning with passion as he looked at the void halberd. Meanwhile, he looked at a few opponents that would inevitably become his enemies and mumbled, “Aren’t they all humans? Don’t provoke me, or else I’ll eat all of you in the future!”</span></p>

There was soft golden silk grass laid here, making it clean and cozy. The inside flickered with silver light. There were a few young chicks that were only half a foot long. Their wings were silvery white in color.&nbsp;</span></p>

There’s nothing really wrong with this place.” Shi Hao said to himself. His nose moved a bit. “There is the smell of precious medicine.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s you! You ate a type of precious medicine just now?” He looked at the special young bird. The more he looked at it, the more shocked he felt. In the end, he couldn’t help but widen his mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why do you look a bit like a silver phoenix…” Shi Hao’s jaw almost dropped onto the ground. This was not a misconception. He moved over and carefully looked at it. It really was too similar.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Returned to your ancestral roots?” He knew that the Silver Winged Bird’s ancestors could be traced back to the phoenix bloodline, but this return was too formidable.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He grasped this half foot long young bird with one go and carefully poked at it, observing it with his eyes. Who would have imagined that it would have such a temper, as if it was furious. It actually reached out a silver claw and fiercely stepped on his nose.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Stop making a fuss.” Shi Hao grabbed it. The more he rubbed its bones and rolled out its feathers, the more shocked he became. This bird was definitely not ordinary. There was mysterious light inside of its body, but it &nbsp;was hazy and impossible to see through.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Defying the heavens! This Silver Winged Bird produced an ancestral return, creating a Silver Phoenix?” Shi Hao truly found this a bit hard to believe. Like a thief, he tossed this young bird into his sleeves before jumping off the cliff.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unexpectedly, the mature Silver Winged Bird didn’t seem anxious at all. When it saw them leave, it actually felt relieved, flying back to the nest.&nbsp;</span></p>

It is really strange. Even if it’s an ancestral return, it shouldn’t be intelligent while being so young. Why do I feel like it can understand me?” Shi Hao said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He lifted the silver little bird up and turned it around to look at it. In the end, the bird was so ashamed that it grabbed one of his fingers with its beak without letting go.</span></p>
