Now that they had been with each other for several months, it was difficult for them to abandon each other.&nbsp;</span></p>

He would never be able to meet these people in this life, this world again.&nbsp;</span></p>

He didn’t know why. This was a wondrous immortal dwelling right? Were these people real, or did he dream of returning to Immortal Ancient, an accidental encounter?</span></p>

Perhaps someday in the future, one of us would still be able to reunite with you in this roiling world of mortals. Even though this thought is rather ridiculous, there is always a trace of hope in the endless years, so who can say for sure.” The young man with the Radiant Immortal Gold Sword said. He looked seriously at Shi Hao, and then he turned around, walking towards the depths of the island, his figure gradually becoming indistinct.&nbsp;</span></p>

We will scatter with the wind, watching your battles and brilliance from this world’s dust!” Another person walked over, giving Shi Hao his farewells.&nbsp;</span></p>

We really have to go, cannot meet again.” The young lady who carried the little White Qilin said softly, extremely emotional.&nbsp;</span></p>

The ones before his eyes were all living people. After associating with them for several months, they already developed close relationships, sharing feelings. Were they really never going to meet again?</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Look, they’re here.” The young man who carried the Radiant Immortal Gold Sword on his back pointed into the distant sky. There was a giant sinister eye that was larger than a mountain peak, opening in the void. In that direction, enormous bony outgrowths grew, hacking down from the heavens. There was gray mist there, surging over from the cosmos…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that instant, this peaceful and auspicious pure land was corrupted, becoming a deathly gray. Immediately afterwards, shouts of war shook the skies.</span></p>

Magical force surged, yet they couldn’t resist a single strike.&nbsp;</span></p>

Southern Sea Purple Bamboo Forest split apart, the jade sea rising. Several young supreme beings did everything they could to resist, but they were still destroyed.</span></p>

They already shared deep feelings, yet they died just like that in the end.</span></p>

He was taking action, wishing to stop everything, wishing to redeem something.</span></p>

He looked towards the great figures in the immortal manor, turning his head there.</span></p>

Six Dao Reincarnations Immortal King had long used the Reincarnation Disk to fight intensely against a mysterious expert, as if a reincarnation of the world was taking place there, scenes overlaying on top of each other one after the other.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In addition, Without End great one was also taking action, the great bell sound long and drawn-out, breaking the river of time, interfering with the flow of time, making that place blurry.&nbsp;</span></p>

They fought against him, blasting that great bell, making it tremble violently, continuously release ringing sounds.&nbsp;</span></p>

He was like an outsider traveling between all different types of scenes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The scene was incredibly realistic, angry roars ringing until his ears were in pain. The tragic massacre made his blood surge, his mouth roaring endlessly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he was completely helpless, as if he was incompatible with this world, as if he was peeled away from that world.&nbsp;</span></p>

A scarlet pair of eyes lit up inside, attacking her viciously. Bloody light splashed outwards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao’s eyes were completely red. Even though this young lady was a bit mischievous and lively, she was extremely good and honest. She suffered a disaster just like that?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He took action furiously, attacking viciously, but it didn’t do anything, as if he was unrelated.&nbsp;</span></p>

This is our conclusion. Goodbye, we might never meet again.” When the gray mists scattered, that young lady’s eyes lost spirit, her arms powerless. The little White Qilin she held whimpered, falling onto the ground.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why, tell me!” Shi Hao’s eyes were completely red, hot tears falling, staring at her, looking at all of these people he was now familiar with.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“All so you could see our situation, Immortal Ancient’s cruelty. You have to prepare yourself. In the future, you will definitely fight them.” The young lady spat out bits of blood from her mouth, speaking with difficulty.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You all, you all…” Shi Hao’s eyes went red, battle intent surging. He stared at the battlefield; it was just too bitter and miserable. The pure and holy immortal residence was dyed red in blood so quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We are unwilling to leave things like this too…” Someone sighed softly. This came from the mouth of a young supreme being, one of the few individuals with three strands of immortal energy. However, he still died in the end, killed here.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Haha, hahaha…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">” The young man who carried the Radiant Immortal Gold Sword laughed loudly, his eyes carrying tears. The divine sword was already in his hand, intensely fighting, completely distressed as he said, “Immortal Ancient Great Era is going to end, we really can’t accept this! We haven’t even grown up yet, unable to fight the intense battle with our seniors.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You can see this for yourself. Are you still unconvinced?” The phoenix girl was downcast. She looked at Shi Hao, the five-colored battle clothes on her body shining. Three strands of immortal energy swirled about, doing everything she could to attack and resist the intruders.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have seen it. Is it because of the seniors’ power that created this miracle, allowing me to see this scene through endless time?” Shi Hao gazed towards Six Dao Reincarnations Immortal King, Without End great one, understanding a bit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Correct!” The phoenix girl nodded.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“One of them touched upon reincarnation, while the other severed the flow of time. For things to end like this, they truly would find it hard to accept. No matter what, they had to leave later generations with some clues.” That young lady released the little White Qilin, weakly speaking a few final sentences, and then ultimately falling, no longer releasing any life aura.&nbsp;</span></p>

He looked at these people who were dying one after another, all of them he had only just gotten to know.</span></p>

What kind of methods were these? Had he stepped foot into a soul realm, speaking with remnant souls, or was he pulled into Immortal Ancient Great Era’s final days through magical force, witnessing scenes after scenes as a bystander.&nbsp;</span></p>

He felt great pain inside.</span></p>

This place was originally extremely peaceful, auspicious, the atmosphere joyous, but in the blink of an eye, there was this type of goodbyes, everything coming to an end.</span></p>

He tightly clenched his fists, eyes entirely red, carrying tears.</span></p>

This dream back to Immortal Ancient will stay and watch over Immortal Ancient.” Shi Hao muttered, hot tears rolling down his cheeks.&nbsp;</span></p>

In the distance, the great bell grew dim, the reassembled Reincarnation Disk also splitting apart.</span></p>

We can never meet again.” The young man holding the Radiant Immortal Gold Sword was disappointed. His body began to break apart. He gave Shi Hao a look, and then he completely withered way, blood splashing more than ten feet into the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“When one’s cultivation is powerful enough, it can affect the future?

He watched as the people he became close to in this world died. A great roar of despair sounded from his mouth.&nbsp;</span></p>
