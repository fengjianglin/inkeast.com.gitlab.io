It easily carried more than twenty people, as well as the enormous elephants, fierce tigers, large snakes, and other prey.&nbsp;</span></p>

How did they even grow such a large snail? The higher realms really was strange.</span></p>

It was entirely black like black jade. It sparkled with crystalline splendor and was extremely sturdy. Right now, it was crawling with great speed just like a speeding horse.&nbsp;</span></p>

It was because of their guardian spirit.&nbsp;</span></p>

There was an enormous spiderweb at the front of the village that was silver and brilliant. A large spider was crawling on top, one that was as large as the wild elephant.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was Vermilion Village’s guardian spirit. It protected over a thousand family members. Normally, it didn’t move from the web and quietly cultivated.</span></p>

The spider silk was extremely brilliant, as if it was a protective screen, shielding the village within.&nbsp;</span></p>

It didn’t move at all, normally just staying in the web like that, devouring the essence of sun and moon to cultivate.&nbsp;</span></p>

This large spider couldn’t be considered weak. It was just the guardian spirit of a village, but it already reached Spiritual Transformation Realm. It was quite amazing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The silver large spider seemed to have sensed something. It opened its eyes and looked over, giving Shi Hao a glance. Its entire body released radiance. Then, it began to cultivate again.&nbsp;</span></p>

They selected a massive saber-toothed tiger and delivered it to the two li wide great net.&nbsp;</span></p>

A chewing sound could be heard behind them. That saber-toothed tiger was quickly devoured by the large silver spider.&nbsp;</span></p>

Once one passed this, the terrain would open up and houses appeared in large amounts.&nbsp;</span></p>

This Wild Dragon Elephant was injured and ended up encountering us, so it was directly slaughtered.” The elder on the snail said with a smiling expression.&nbsp;</span></p>

How did you end up bringing back an injured individual?” Quite a few individuals from Vermilion Village surrounded him.</span></p>

He was only eleven or twelve years old, a child named Zhu Jun. He was still a child. His face was rather tender. Right now, he had on an excited appearance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The villagers all looked at each other in dismay. They stared at Shi Hao, looking at him over and over.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“His injuries are so severe. Was he smashed into by a Pixiu? Why do I feel like at least twenty bones were broken?!”&nbsp;</span></p>

When they saw Shi Hao, they felt that his injuries were extremely serious. In reality, all of Shi Hao’s bones were pretty much broken.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let third grandfather take a look.”&nbsp;</span></p>

He understood medicine, so normally, all of the injuries of the villagers were looked at by him. He had great prestige in this village.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind the village was a courtyard. It was extremely peaceful here. There was a mud pool here. This was where third grandfather resided.&nbsp;</span></p>

He slightly raised his body and expressed his thanks towards these villagers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Third grandfather’s face was covered in white hair. His body was a bit hunchbacked. With a hoarse voice, he said, “Youngster, I do not know your background, but I feel that you are quite unordinary. I wish that your visit does not affect things here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When there were relatively fewer people, Shi Hao tactfully expressed that he didn’t need third grandfather’s treatment and that he could recover on his own. He just wanted to live here for a period of time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Third grandfather nodded and made some room in the courtyard.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There are three thousand provinces in this realm?” This was what Shi Hao learned from a youth’s mouth after he decided to stay here. It immediately left him somewhat stupefied. This was too shocking.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">You have to understand that he had already heard in the lower realm that one province was many times larger than all of the eight regions added together.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Three thousand provinces… just how large was this realm? Meanwhile, this was just what everyone had explored so far. If the even larger mysterious uninhabited areas were added together, it was simply inconceivable!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, Shi Hao didn’t reveal any shock in front of Vermilion Village’s people. He obtained all of this information through indirect approaches.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Three thousand provinces is an older saying. As for how many provinces there truly are, we cannot say clearly. Not even those great figures can be certain,” said third grandfather.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, the higher realms was just too vast. Its territory was boundless without borders. It was precisely because it was so enormous that it was able to produce countless experts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao felt relieved. A province was already several times greater than the lower realm’s eight regions combined, so a province’s land could naturally produce heavenly talents and terrifying geniuses.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the following days, Shi Hao adjusted his injured body and slowly recovered. At the same time, he studied this world’s great dao, preparing to complete his body’s natural laws.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The most effective method was rebirth, allowing himself to transform and become complete.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this process would definitely be full of suffering. He needed to break all of his body’s bones and exchange his blood. It was going to be a dangerous process.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, he had made abundant preparations. Immortal Mountain’s rebirth method and other techniques were things he had grasped a long time ago. In addition, he had Fire Nation’s Vermilion Bird rebirth technique, as well as even the higher realms’ noble lady Hong Huang race’s phoenix related rebirth method.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The broken bones have already pieced together again. It seems like if I want to transform, I will have to break them apart again…” Shi Hao said softly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The divine striking stone entered a state of slumber, because after climbing the heavenly path, it suffered many cracks from the great explosion. It needed to slowly recover and recombine.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A few days passed. Shi Hao’s understanding of this world’s laws and dao became more profound. He knew what he ought to do. He prepared to replenish his body’s natural laws and carry out a rebirth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wuwu...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, a bugle horn sounded that was incomparably oppressive, as if a demonic beast was roaring. The sound transmitted especially far. All of Vermilion Village was startled.&nbsp;</span></p>

They ran towards the front of the village.&nbsp;</span></p>

It was like a hundred streams gathering into an ocean. Many warriors gathered to carry out an intense competition.</span></p>

This truly was a large scale event. What was the purpose of doing this? Was it truly like a hundred rivers gathering into the sea, with layers and layers of selection of the best? These rivers all ultimately flowed back into the sea.&nbsp;</span></p>
