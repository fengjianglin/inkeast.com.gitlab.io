It had extraordinary divine effects. Unfortunately, only a limited few number of individuals could eat it. For the other races, they could only refine and absorb a small part of its essence, ingesting it only with other precious medicines. Ninety percent of it was going to be wasted.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If I could eat the whole thing, it would be equal to obtaining another trump card…” Shi Hao said to himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He swallowed close to three hundred stalks of Soul blood grass, and only then did he produce a moment of magical immunity. When facing enemies, it had terrifying effectiveness, allowing him to even kill deities.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this type of ability would weaken with the advancement of cultivation realms, to the extent where it would even become negligible.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This ability won’t continue to become stronger, and when the day comes that he ignites his divine flame, and this ability still maintains its original state, it would gradually become more and more useless as his cultivation realm increases.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">According to legend, only the Golden Bodhi fruit could make this type of ability strengthen along with one’s growth just like the Ape Demons of the Blood Plains. Once one obtained the Golden Bodhi fruit, everything changed. They would become a different type of species and undergo a fundamental transformation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If this type of ability can be maintained for a long time and accompany my growth, it will definitely be an extraordinary thing.” Shi Hao was extremely hopeful.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only, what gave him a headache was that the Golden Bodhi fruit was too tyrannical. The human race couldn’t endure its effects, as their constitution would clash with this fruit. That was why he was interested in the Tribulation crossing divine lotus.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I definitely have to think of a way to eat this Golden Bodhi fruit. That way, when the great battle of three thousand provinces happens, even though they have all types of trump cards, I will have another great slaughter method as well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ever since he heard about the Great Scarlet Sky flame, and seven colored Immortal gold, those heaven defying things, he didn’t dare act carelessly. He definitely couldn’t look down on anyone, or else he would suffer for it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little brother, are you interested in joining my Devil Wind Mercenary Group? We are going to search for seven colored Immortal gold together.” At this moment, someone called out to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao turned around and saw an elder. This person carried a kind smile and enthusiastically welcomed him into his group. He looked again and again, but he directly refused.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was because the people of Fufeng City were too unusual. Even if not all the residents were bad people, it wasn’t far from it. They were all cunning and dangerous, and most of them were notorious bandits.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As expected, as soon as he turned around, that elder muttered to himself and said, “There aren’t enough cannon fodder… They’re so hard to find.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao’s forehead was covered in dark lines. He really wanted to turn around and give him a beating. Did he look that much like cannon fodder? Ever since he entered this place, he discovered that he met scoundrels again and again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Generally speaking, this was a chaotic place. There really wasn’t much good people.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, when he thought more deeply, these bandits were quite ‘cute’ as well, scheming here and there and using their ‘methods’ to feed themselves.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The restricted areas Goddess Academy announced were all distributed throughout Fire Province. These places were suspected to contain seven colored Immortal gold, and as long as someone could find concrete proof, they would have the opportunity to soak for one day and night in Tribulation crossing divine lotus water.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was because not even someone as powerful as Goddess Academy could search them one after another. Those places were too dangerous, and the losses would be too severe. Only when they were sure of one place would they concentrate their efforts in searching that ancient place. This was the most dependable way.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fire Province was a place rich with divine gold, as well as all types of heavenly treasures. They were all top quality precious materials for refining weapons, and that was why the great sects of the higher realms all flocked over to occupy this place.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The enormous Fire Province was divided into many regions, and there were many rich ores, but these were also the reasons resulting in the Immortal gold legends. Since ancient times, it had always been widely circulated, and these rumors had never ended.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Similarly, Fire Province really was a peculiar place. From time to time, flames would mysteriously appear from the ground to burn all things. There were quite a few mysterious and supernatural events that had taken place.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And it was also precisely because of this that there were several great taboo areas to speak of.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone firmly believed that Fire Province definitely had some heaven shocking secret, only, it was extremely difficult to explore them all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a result, many mercenary groups and loose cultivators moved out together, heading for those taboo regions’ surrounding areas to look for clues. They wanted to obtain that great reward.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though bandits and loose cultivators were savage, they also knew that some places could only be explored from the distance and not entered. Otherwise, they would undoubtedly die.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some of the restricted areas had damaged Immortal Ancient formations that had trapped old sect masters to death, some ancient regions were like a great sea to get lost in. Once one entered them, they would lose their soul. It was extremely strange and mysterious.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fufeng City was incredibly bustling with activity. Group after group set off, disappearing into the distance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao also left. He wanted to find a peaceful place to recover from his injuries, and then he would think about everything else.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The grassland stretched as far as the eye could see, but it wasn’t all covered in grass. He flew several thousand li and discovered a mountain range that he wanted to use to go into isolation, but as soon as he appeared, a wave of white flames soared up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This made him shiver inwardly. No wonder there were rumors of there being strange spontaneous combustions that caused deaths. These places in Fire Province really were dangerous.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the end, he noticed a village where there were several hundred people and wanted to try and stay here. Places where people stayed in definitely went through many ordeals and wouldn’t be a dangerous place.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, as soon as he entered, he underwent all types of interrogation. The village’s people treated him completely like a vicious savage.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the end, after Shi Hao gifted them with a divine material, he was finally permitted to stay here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He hid within a house, using up five days before finally recovering from his injuries. The main reason he was able to recover so quickly was because of the great effects of the precious pill Kong Qiuji had him take. Otherwise, it would have definitely taken longer.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This made his eyes cold. With his constitution and the unbreakable body already reaching this kind of level, one could see how vicious the Celestial Clan’s methods were. After his cultivation was sealed, that vicious sword damaged his flesh, harming his vital areas and vitality.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao got up and silently used this time for comprehension. He felt like he had recovered to his peak state, so he decided that he would head for a place to hide himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He wanted to take a look, see if that place really had the chaotic flame. He was inwardly hopeful, only, he didn’t know whether the clues were accurate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He saw many creatures from all different races wandering about Fire Province’s great earth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Along the way, he saw a few ancient mines that released auspicious multicolored light and great brilliance. There were clearly rare divine materials within them, but unfortunately, they were all occupied by a few great sects.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the end, he landed in a front of a great rift valley. This place was quite secluded and incomparably spacious; it was just too large. It covered an area of over ten thousand li.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao frowned. This place was quite strange. Was there a Chaotic flame underneath? He was a bit hesitant. He could clearly see that the surroundings of the great rift valley had been refined, forming a layer of ceramic glaze-like luster. It was clear that earth flames would seep out from time to time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He took out the pill furnace, put on the tattered armor, and completed his defensive preparations. If there really was no way, he would immediately escape.&nbsp;</span></p>

The radiance became more and more dim, ultimately forming a dark expanse. It was pitch-black without a bit of sound.&nbsp;</span></p>

It was as if he entered the dark and desolate outer space, unable to feel the slightest trace of life.</span></p>

He swooped down several dozens of li, all the way until he was more than a hundred li down, and then he finally saw some blurry outlines. This was an expanse of ruins.&nbsp;</span></p>

He was so deep underground, so how could there still be debris? Were there people who lived here before.&nbsp;</span></p>

This meant that this used to be a vast and magnificent buildings.&nbsp;</span></p>

Shi Hao explored for an entire day and night. He was now sure that this abyss was extremely strange. There were many enormous rocks, remains, and other things. They all seeped out from beneath the earth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, he shivered inwardly, feeling a strange sensation. A strand of mist seeped out from the depths of the abyss.&nbsp;</span></p>

The surface unexpectedly split apart, and a strange wave of energy began to fluctuate about. It stirred up the debris, enormous stones and other things until they tumbled out from the abyss depths.&nbsp;</span></p>

Soon after, he discovered that there was no longer any debris or enormous rocks shooting outwards, only the crack was widening.</span></p>

Through the enormous cracks, he saw a shining underground palace. Of course, it was already damaged and fell into the depths of the earth. Strand after strand of chaotic energy was seeping out from it.&nbsp;</span></p>

There was a grand dao platform at the center of the ruins that towered like a mountain. There were a few things laying in disarray on it that released chaotic energy.</span></p>

It was covered in mottled copper rust, as if it had existed through endless eras.&nbsp;</span></p>
