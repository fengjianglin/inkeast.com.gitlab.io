His true body didn’t move, continuing to tower in the heavens. His head of black hair rushed chaotically into the heavens, making him look like a reincarnated demonic god!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The true bone inside his chest shone brilliantly. That small figure quickly enlarged, rushing out with endless divine patterns towards Yue Chan’s main body. It was fast to the extreme.&nbsp;</span></p>

A chill ran down her back, and all of her fine hairs stood on end. She felt as if she was facing an imminent catastrophe, because the distance between them was just too close. It was difficult to avoid this attack.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She released a light shout. Her wonderful sparkling and translucent body surged with all types of light. She used all of her cultivation to defend herself!</span></p>

How could the hidden attack from a young supreme being be so easily neutralized? The supreme being symbols had long reached her and covered her body. Her actions were a bit late.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chi!</span></p>

Then, they all returned to her body.&nbsp;</span></p>

A large portion of the precious techniques was cut off!</span></p>

Her bright and clean beautiful pupils became extremely deep. The mysterious scene of a deity mending the heavens emerged. The nine heavens and tenth earth’s people knelt down and offered their worship, a scene that seemed to last for all of eternity.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this time, Shi Hao’s precious technique was abnormally powerful, surpassing the past. The little figure on the supreme being bone personally slaughtered outwards. This was the physical embodiment of those scriptures.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hong!</span></p>

The boundless phenomenon of the world being mended immediately became indistinct, and the heavens began to distort. The space around them began to collapse.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dazzling light erupted between the two. This was clearly a life and death struggle, yet there was this incredibly beautiful scene.&nbsp;</span></p>

The fist swirled with resplendent symbols, collapsing the scenery of the heavens being mended. Beams of light rushed into the heavens.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yue Chan staggered in reverse, and blood was coughed out from her mouth. The attack this time was released in too much of a hurry, and her precious techniques were all suppressed backwards. Not even the Heaven Mending Technique had a chance to display its greatest power before being wiped out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the final moment, she still did everything she could to activate heaven mending profound mysteries. At this moment, her mind tried to reverse everything and chance the results of this battle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was where the Heaven Mending Technique’s heaven defying areas laid. It was innately undefeatable and could reverse a life and death situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her beautiful hair danced about. A large portion of her sparkling white skin was exposed from the tattered clothes, making her look like a reborn goddess. Her impressive curves were soft. Pure and holy radiance scattered out from her body, igniting the deepest potential within her body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Heaven Mending Technique had originally been weakened, but together with this support, it shone again. It was going to change the situation from her being cut down.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The magnificent chanting of scriptures sounded again, originating from two different individuals. They belonged to two different scripture meanings. They collided, interweaved, and formed the most primordial true profoundness.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hong!</span></p>

Quite a bit of the Heaven Mending Technique was exhausted, and the other side’s figure also dimmed, about to return to nothingness.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Success!” Yue Chan revealed a smile. As long as she was able to persevere through this desperate moment, she still had all types of methods. She became inwardly joyous, and a smile blossomed on her face, brightening up even the space around her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, what happened the next moment let her horrified. Even though the figure was erased, the endless supreme being symbols didn’t vanish. It continued to rumble and descend downwards.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No!”</span></p>

Her flesh became sparkling and dazzling, as if flames raged about her to block these terrifying law symbols.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She already understood clearly that this was the other party’s supreme being precious technique. It was similarly terrifying, and just now, that figure was the embodiment of an even deeper layer of understanding.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This truly was the case. When Shi Hao displayed this technique in the past, even if these symbols appeared, he didn’t summon the little figure on top of the bone. Only these last two times did he do this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During the first time, that little figure blocked the disaster in his place, falling within the divine level formation. The second time had exhausted too much of Yue Chan’s strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Yue Chan’s body became sparkling and translucent, as if she was the goddess within raging flames. She erupted with auspicious multicolored radiance that blazed with flourishing light. She wanted to undergo rebirth within the flames. Undying energy blossomed in this place.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unfortunately, she had still exhausted too much in the end, and the attack happened too suddenly. At this moment, her power was already weakened and couldn’t stop the bone texts. Even though quite a bit of it had been destroyed, she was still covered underneath.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The supreme being symbolled radiance gradually declined. Yue Chan cried out in alarm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moonlight scattered downwards, making this place shine bright with moonlight. That wonderful figure disappeared, and in her place was a tender and underripe girl.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her hair was completely black, and she had large, swirling black eyes. Even though she looked quite intelligent, she appeared to be uneasy and incredibly nervous. Her fists were tightly clenched, and her tattered clothes seemed extremely loose, as if they were going to fall right off.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shi Hao!” She cried out. Even though her voice was extremely pleasant to listen to, it was still too delicate. She couldn’t help but cry out in surprise as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao walked over, wiping the blood from the corners of his lips and revealing a piercing gaze. The figure on his supreme being bone had been destroyed twice, as a result injuring him. Even though they were formed from symbols and could be reproduced, they were still an embodiment of his supreme being source.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the results were astonishing. He looked down at the young and immature looking Yue Chan. He could directly suppress and kill her right now!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yue Chan had become smaller, her appearance refined and gentle. Her large eyes that were spinning with spiritual essence swirled about. She was truly scared. This type of situation actually happened; it was unbelievable.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Earlier, she was extremely decisive and didn’t give Shi Hao any opportunities to retaliate, directly using the divine formations to kill him. She personally witnessed him being blasted apart. She did this out of fear that he might still have some other trump cards to rely on.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Who could have expected that that was only a fake body that was produced by the supreme being bone’s symbols! It possessed incomparably fighting strength, but it wasn’t his true body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, Shi Hao’s injuries weren’t light. This was a rare bitter struggle since he had made his appearance in the world, making him spit out quite a bit of blood. This main body of Yue Chan really was frightening and almost made him fall here.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hong!</span></p>

The skies even seemed like they were going to shatter from these sounds. It could be seen just how humiliated and resentful she felt.
