Sad and bleak words sounded. Everyone threw themselves forward, carrying him in their arms. They poured divine force into his body as a final act of keeping him in this world.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Actually… I don’t want to leave you guys either… to leave like this, I am already extremely satisfied…” Shi Hao’s eyes grew dim, losing expression. He was truly a lamp that had ran out of fuel, exhausting all of his energy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No, you said that you were going to come back to Stone Village to look around.

Dazhuang, Pihou, Ermeng, Huzi, snot baby, these people had all accompanied him since his youth. They had stolen from vicious birds’ nests and ran all over the mountains and plains, growing up together.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many past events appeared in his mind. How happy were they when they were young? How carefree? They had caused trouble and explored the great wastelands together.&nbsp;</span></p>

The veins on their foreheads were bulging. They felt anxious and helpless.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A group of elders were trembling as they made their way up. Their old faces were full of flusteredness. They offered their prayers, continuously saying those words to prolong his life.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even those great aunts were weeping. Their naughty children were silently crying. Everyone felt helpless, not knowing what to do.&nbsp;</span></p>

He was so weak that it was hard for him to even speak. It was because his dreams had already been realized. He released a breath of air. He was already on the verge of death.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Streaks that looked like copper stains appeared on his body one after another. Once these symbols activated, they were incredibly powerful. Now that he lost his supreme being bone, it became even harder for him to resist them.&nbsp;</span></p>

However, now, his vitality was about to be completely exhausted.&nbsp;</span></p>

You will definitely live. You cannot close your eyes!” Shi Yunfeng shouted. He always acted kindly, but right now, he was roaring loudly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao’s eyes didn’t have any luster left, as if he was a candle that had gone out with the wind. He was about to go out. His life force was scattering away. He was going to disappear from this world forever.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Ziling was on one side, and Qin Yining was on the other. They both grabbed his arm to somehow keep him here, but they were powerless, unable to reverse the situation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The silver peaches are here. Feed them to him and help Hao’er refine them!” An elder roared loudly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, Shi Hao’s eyes were about to close. They were extremely dark. He already couldn’t see much anymore.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Yining frantically brought over the silver peaches and sent them to his mouth, helping him refine them. It would be fine even if it granted him just a bit more time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The silver peaches aren’t enough. It has already been used, so the effectiveness is too weak. Use this!” Hairy Ball shouted loudly. It had rushed over together with Little Red.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One of them lost half its body, and the other a pair of wings. They were gravely injured and unable to move freely, but right now, they still forcefully gathered their strength and jumped over everyone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a wine bottle that was simple and unadorned in appearance. It was full of an ancient feeling, carrying with it the aura of a passed time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Inside of the bottle was only a drop of wine that was incredibly vicious. It was stuck at the bottom of the container, making it difficult to even extract. There was a unique wine flavor. As soon as it appeared, it made a few villagers fall from intoxication.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was divine wine obtained from the Kun Peng Next. They had never used it after Shi Hao brought it back, preserving it to this day.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before, this drop of wine had been brought to Stone Country Imperial Palace. They wanted him to ingest it, but he refused, because he didn’t want to waste too many divine objects since they couldn’t change the conclusion.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even now, no one was willing to accept this ending. Meanwhile Hairy Ball and Little Red also wanted to give it a try. This was completely a type of faith in the Kun Peng, one of the Archaic Vicious Ten, as well as a final entrusting of hope.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This drop of liquid was the size of a dragon eye fruit. It was like a gemstone, flowing with dreamlike radiance. It was forcefully fed into Shi Hao’s mouth and then refined into his stomach.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Shi Hao had already closed his eyes, seemingly devoid of life force.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It is definitely enough, it will definitely bring him back to life.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Even if it is just a single day, that is enough!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The wine entered his body. Everyone joined forces, taking action together, turning the liquid into a hot stream, guiding it into his limbs and blood vessels. A wave of flourishing radiance filled his body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone became shocked. They widened their eyes. Could it be that a miracle was going to happen?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This wine has divine medicinal characteristics! It wasn’t ordinary after all!” Hairy Ball sighed and said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao’s body was shining. Every inch of his flesh was surging with multicolored mist that wrapped around his body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The wine left behind by the Kun Peng was not ordinary after all. It was worthy of being one of the vicious ten, with even the alcohol it drank containing divine medicinal characteristics. If it wasn’t for Immortal Palace’s curse being so special, any other illness would have definitely been immediately cured.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone watched nervously. They were all praying for a miracle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was something completely unexpected. It was just a drop, yet it seemed to be more effective than even the holy medicine the War King and the others found. This was great news.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Shi Hao’s eyes remained closed, and his life force didn’t recover. It seemed to have been severed from his body with no sign of improving.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This made everyone incredibly nervous. None of them could stand still.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Along with the passage of time, Shi Hao’s body released a wine fragrance. Hazy mist flowed about the surface of his body, as if he was sound asleep from drinking too much.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unfortunately, his breathing seemed to stop, which made everyone incredibly worried.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Time seemed to be stretched extremely long. After an unknown amount of time passed, a few children whose cultivation weren’t high enough already fell asleep from the alcoholic scent, collapsing here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was clear how odd this wine was. It possessed unordinary effects.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What a pity it is. In the end, it was still unable to defy the heavens…” Little Red sighed. It and Hairy Ball had ignited their divine flames, so their eyes were naturally powerful. They both couldn’t help but shake their heads.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He should be able to revive and stay awake for a short period of time. However, it won’t change anything. It is still just wine that the Kun Peng left behind and not some life saving pill medicine.” Hairy Ball said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When everyone heard this, their faces became deathly pale.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chief Shi Yunfeng clenched his fists. Sighing softly, he said, “Let’s return to Stone Village. When the child opens his eyes again, he can see a place that is full of activity. This was the place where he grew up after all.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Inside the village were stone houses made of sturdy mountain stones. Dried meat hung from the courtyard walls and beast skins hung from the back of the houses.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The streets were peaceful. Bluestone lined the floor, clean without any dust. Many spiritual medicines lined both sides of the road.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A while later, Shi Hao’s breathing became a bit more stable, and he finally opened his eyes. He looked around blankly, stirring up cries of alarm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ve made you all worried again.” He weakly opened his mouth. Regardless of whether it was him or everyone else, they all knew that there wasn’t much time left.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ermeng carried him while walking through the village, walking from one street to another. The big yellow dog the village chief raised whose tail had long become bare ran along them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These familiar streets, familiar people, Shi Hao was at a loss as to how to feel. He was truly reluctant to leave this place. It was as if he had returned to the past.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was extremely small back then, being called the little guy by the villagers back then. He always ran behind a group of large kids and loved to pull on that big yellow dog’s tail. He was extremely young and naive back then.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finally, everyone came to the head of the village. Shi Hao sat there, looking at the small pot inside the courtyard. He began to laugh.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone else all began to smile in memory again, recalling how he was back then, always coming here early in the morning to sneakily cook beast milk so that no one else would find out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because of this, many people had laughed at him, but he didn't care. He continued to slowly cook it, every time coming out with his little face sticky and dirty.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What a pity. Willow Deity has left.” Shi Hao sighed softly. He wanted to go to the higher realms and compete with those exceptional talents and heavenly geniuses, and he also wanted to go to the mysterious area to search for Willow Deity. However, in the end, he would never have the chance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone became silent. If the Willow Deity was still here, everything could probably be changed, right? How would it have ended like this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they saw the spiritual medicines, silver peach tree and octadic treasure chicken, everyone felt deeply emotional. Back then, Shi Hao was still little, yet he continuously brought things back to the village. He was a little adult that always thought about his home.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was still young, but because of him, Stone Village had already undergone so many transformations.&nbsp;</span></p>

Nothing bad will happen.” A little child pulled at the corners of his clothes while saying with his head raised. Tears filled his eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For them, Shi Hao was their best uncle. Every time he returned, he would always bring them into the great wasteland to run around. They could steal from vicious bird nests and catch fierce beasts, satisfying all of their dreams.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In their hearts, Shi Hao was the most powerful. No one could compare to him. However, he was going to die today. Every single child was shedding tears.&nbsp;</span></p>

When he saw them, he thought of his own past. He smiled but didn’t say anything.&nbsp;</span></p>

She didn’t leave Stone Village yet. Her emotions were complex. After she learned about everything, she could only sigh.&nbsp;</span></p>

The main body cultivation method required too much time. Shi Hao wouldn’t last that long at all. He didn’t have that much time.&nbsp;</span></p>

It continuously ran around Shi Hao while crying out.&nbsp;</span></p>
