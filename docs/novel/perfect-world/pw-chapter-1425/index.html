 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chapter 1425 - Standpoint</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huang wanted to kill Wang Family’s five dragons, moreover not hiding it at all, stating it in front of everyone. Instead of saying that this was a type of resolution from Shi Hao, it was better to say that this was a type of attitude!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, Wang Family went too far, actually releasing Lightning Spirits to harm him. Those were a rare species who had only appeared in legends. They grasped heavenly tribulation, and if it was anyone else in his place, they would have undoubtedly died.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even Shi Hao, if not for his senses being sharp, realizing it ahead of time, he might have been seriously injured.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Family had tried to harm him to death many times, not considering the greater situation at all. There were countless foreign troops outside Imperial Pass, yet only for their selfish wishes, they wanted to get rid of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, Shi Hao was angered, completely furious. Wang Family wanted to harm him to death again and again, fearing that he would grow up and then threaten their clan, so they used all methods they had.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now, he spoke out in public, not out of hopes that someone would go kill the five dragons, but rather as a type of declaration, to slap Wang Familys’ faces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Originally, this was something Wang Family would normally try to cover up, so he wanted to expose it in front of everyone, let everyone know.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was because not everyone in Imperial Pass knew that the Lightning Spirits belonged to Wang Family, more of them being jealous of Shi Hao’s fortune, that he could subdue this type of heaven-defying creature.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The group of elders were left in an extremely awkward situation. Even though they held scorn for Wang Family, to have them go over and kill them right now, kill the five dragons, they really couldn’t do it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One had to understand that Wang Family is a huge power. If they slaughtered their way over, it would be the same as declaring war against Wang Family. This wouldn’t be a small matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Family had Immortal Wang, a matchless figure on par with Meng Tianzheng, only half a step away from immortality. His magical force was unequalled, incomparable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If not for the environment changing, this individual would simply be a True Immortal!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If the world’s environment didn’t change, he would have definitely become a True Immortal who could overlook all clans, unmatched under the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, there were some who suspected that with the other side’s attacks, the two realms’ realm wall had long been broken, about to merge together, evolve. At that time, the great environment might very well change. At that time, Immortal Wang might become a True Immortal!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one was willing to take action. There was a private side to this, and also a public side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for public, Imperial Pass didn’t permit disorder, attacking a giant power like Wang Family would definitely produce chaos.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, apart from Wang Family’s five dragons, there were a hundred thousand elite troops who came as well, personally sent over by Immortal Wang. Together with Wang Family’s soldiers who were in Imperial Pass to begin with, this was a force that couldn’t be looked down on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Little brother, it is best if we do not act impetuous on this matter.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Exactly, we know you were wronged, but it still isn’t the right time to make a big fuss.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Some people advised against this, but they acted carefully. No matter what, Imperial Pass didn’t permit disorder, no sides tolerated it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, everyone knew that Wang Family definitely had to bleed for this, or else this matter most likely wouldn’t end. At the very least, Meng Tianzheng wouldn’t agree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wang Family has gone too far, trying to harm me again and again, if this continues, sooner or later, I will be killed by them. Why can’t they be punished severely?!” Shi Hao said furiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He expressed his intentions here. He needed an explanation for this, even more so needing a guarantee, or else this type of hidden danger couldn’t be defended against effectively.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Correct, Wang Family is too shameless, taking action again and again. In my opinion, they should just be directly wiped out, completely razed to the ground!” Cao Yusheng nodded. He was already standing on Shi Hao’s side, long opposing Wang Family, so he didn’t fear offending them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wang Family’s five dragons, the reason they came to Imperial Pass wasn’t because they really wanted to provide reinforcements, but because they made a grave mistake! It was because they wanted to kill Huang that they were banished here. Now, they made another mistake, so they have to be punished severely!” The Lunar Jade Rabbit and Heavenly Horned Ant both criticized harshly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wang Family bullies others too intolerably, trying to harm me again and again. Fellow daoists, do you all really think this clan will become a cornerstone of power against the enemies outside Imperial Pass? They are wielding their halberds against their own, this type of family will only make others feel fear. If something extreme happens at the crucial moment, then it would be a great disaster!” Shi Hao said with a serious expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn’t fear stirring things bigger. He behaved in such an ostentatious manner precisely to badly burn Wang Family from head to toe, only this could make others bleed, grant himself more benefits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn’t hope for this instance to completely uproot the clan, that wasn’t realistic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How daring! A younger generation like you dares humiliate my Wang Family, what proof do you have? Moreover, you killed my clansmen without any cause or reason, killing an elder, we still didn’t settle things with you, yet you are already trying to start a fight? I cannot stand letting you live!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the distance, someone shouted loudly, standing at the horizon, clouds surging, primal chaos rising. This was clearly an extremely great expert!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn’t truly dare come over, after all, Meng Tianzheng was precisely here, only wishing to refute Shi Hao’s words, express a type of angered attitude.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Shi Hao heard this, his brows immediately stood on end. He was almost harmed, yet the other person was blaming him instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you all still want any face?” Shi Hao shouted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Truly shameless, already doing this type of thing, yet you all still want to make a false countercharge!” Cao Yusheng shouted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Unbridled, how can Wang Family be something you all can humiliate and slander?!” On the other side, someone shouted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In reality, Wang Family really was angry. Even though they were the ones who harmed Shi Hao, in the end, Shi Hao didn’t die, but instead obtained natural luck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Regardless of whether it was the Lightning Pool or the mysterious light, they both made Wang Family’s eyes red. They helped the other party accomplish his aim for no reason, and not obtaining this for themselves. This made them vexed and resentful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What made them the most angry was that the Lightning Spirits were actually lost, not nurtured under them anymore. This was one of the greatest trump cards of their clan, if they were properly raised, they would definitely become three unmatched war gods.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unfortunately, after failing to harm Huang, he collected them instead, becoming his weapons. In the future, they will most likely be used to deal with Wang Family, so how could they not feel resentment?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, all of this was from their perspective, they didn’t consider that this was all because they were targeting Shi Hao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“All of you are becoming more and more unreasonable. Just who is being unbridled?” Great Elder Meng Tianzheng spoke up, face becoming cold. Moreover, he reached out a large hand, grabbing towards the horizon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ah</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">, no!” There were three people in total. They turned around to run, frightened to the point where their souls were shaking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Who was Meng Tianzheng? He was someone at the same level as Immortal Wang, unmatched under the sky, who could oppose him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They stood in the distance, not having any intention of taking action. They never expected that after just ‘refuting’ a few sentences, they would trigger Great Elder’s severe discontent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A great hand covered the sky. There were many people in Imperial Pass whose breathing even stopped, enveloped within a constrained pressure. Large amounts of experts fell weak onto the ground, trembling in fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Great Elder took action, no one could stop him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was unknown just how many cultivators shivered in fear. In the end, they fell, unable to move on their own at all. They were shaking down to their soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The three were covered by that large hand, the bones within their bodies making&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">pipa</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;sounds, completely shattering.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was still the result of Great Elder showing mercy, otherwise, with just a bit of might, even if it didn’t completely make contact, they would explode into blasts of bloody mist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Detain them in death prisons, leave them behind to kill enemies on the battlefield later to atone for their crimes!” Great Elder ordered. There was immediately someone who rushed over, bringing the three of them to prison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Meng Tianzheng, you bully others intolerably!” In the distance, someone released a low roar. It came from the building Wang Family came from. Even though there was endless distance separating them, the voice was still transmitted over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bully others intolerably? Even you all have the nerve to say this? This is the perfect time to settle things!” Great Elder Meng Tianzheng’s expression was serious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Great Elder personally saw Shi Hao walk the ‘body as a seed path’, step out on his own great path. He had to bring back justice in his place no matter what.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A great hand moved through the sky. Great Elder took action in front of everyone, that hand covering the sky and sun, crushing the sky dome, grabbing towards Wang Family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Peng!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Along the way, a few figures dropped to the ground, erupting with a bloody radiance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Dao brother, please cease your anger!” Right at this time, an aged voice sounded from the ancestral altar. Moreover, a five-colored streak of divine light extended all the way here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was an ancient war chariot on the five-colored divine great path, pulled by ancient beasts, operated by two attendants. When they arrived, they hurriedly got off, extremely respectful to Great Elder, carrying out a great act of courtesy, inviting him onto the chariot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Dao brother, let us please have a chat, I will definitely satisfy brother, please do not take action.” This voice of urging sounded from the ancestral altar’s direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fine, I will give you face first.” Meng Tianzheng said. He got on the war chariot, quickly disappearing along the five-colored divine light path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before leaving, he returned the Lightning Pool to Shi Hao, moreover telling him that he already applied seals, so there was no need to worry about that streak of light escaping.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Inside this Imperial Pass, one didn’t really have to worry about others stealing things, however.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After things developed like this, a storm temporarily calmed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many people knew that this matter wouldn’t end without Wang Family bleeding greatly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Great Elder left, everyone released a breath of relief. Otherwise, it was as if a mountain was crushing down, making everyone tremble with fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, this was still the result of Great Elder restraining his might. If he let it spread as it pleased, everyone would be crawling on the ground, their bodies shaking uncontrollably.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Supreme Being level, their strength was high up above, unimaginable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, it wasn’t just a group of elders who were lively, rushing over together, even Cao Yusheng, Lunar Jade Rabbit and others all cried out, throwing themselves towards Shi Hao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let me see, just what kind of thing is this Lightning Pool?!” The Heavenly Horned Ant also shouted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A group of people surrounded Shi Hao, wishing to be the first to examine the Lightning Pool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An elder was impatient, ignorantly striking the Lightning Pool, really wishing to break off a piece. However, in the end, his arm became numb, the space between his thumb and forefinger even splitting apart, but the Lightning Pool still didn’t break.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, because of this, a powerful streak of lightning radiance was triggered, burning his entire body black, hair standing on end, leaving him in a sorry state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man wiped at the black ashes covering his face, but he didn’t get upset, instead chuckling and saying, “This thing really is heaven-defying, let me research it a bit more!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this time, Shi Hao was also striking it, carefully studying it. Just what was going on with this thing? Was it really carved from a type of rock? It really was ancient looking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wait, why do I feel like there’s something swimming inside the pool?” Suddenly, an elder cried out strangely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had Shi Hao hold the Lightning Pool without moving, maintain that position just like that. He carefully looked inside the pool. Aside from the sparkling Lightning Tribulation Liquid, he seemed to have seen something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yi</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">, there really seem to be living creatures inside!” Someone else said with a stupefied expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It seems to have come from the Lightning Pool walls, a living thing. Heavens, I seem to have seen several True Dragons swimming inside!” Someone cried out in alarm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hey hey hey</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">, seniors, move out of the way, don’t crowd around like this, let us take a look too!” Cao Yusheng shouted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I will invite everyone to drink a cup of divine wine -- Lightning Tribulation Liquid. Let’s sit down and slowly research.” Shi Hao endured his shock, speaking out like this.</span></p>
