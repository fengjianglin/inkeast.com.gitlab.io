The airflow around him exploded and rumbled like thunder. Spheres of light continuously bloomed. He formed a fist imprint, and as if he was a great sun heavenly deity, he sent it blasting towards Qin Fa!</span></p>

Qin Fa was forced to fly backwards, and he backed up again and again.&nbsp;</span></p>

Shi Hao’s fist quickly arrived. It was simple and direct as it slammed over. The fist changed from dark to bright, with dark light liberating itself into becoming golden in color; this was a fundamental change.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was just too fast and impossible to avoid.</span></p>

A milky white stream of innate essence emerged from his nose and mouth. Countless symbols flickered on his arms that rumbled with tremendous power.&nbsp;</span></p>

Qin Fa used his arms to defend against Shi Hao’s fist; this was the first true clash between the two individuals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In addition, this wasn’t simply some defensive measure. When his arms interweaved, a pair of roaring flood dragons appeared. They formed an enormous pair of silver shears.&nbsp;</span></p>

When they interweaved, they would form two enormous interweaving flood dragons, and they could cut short many powerful weapons.&nbsp;</span></p>

They supported the force of the golden fish and released waves of draconic cries that shook heaven and earth.&nbsp;</span></p>

This type of power swept over like an ocean, and the natural laws were as sharp as divine swords as they hacked down at his fist.&nbsp;</span></p>

His eyes rapidly shrunk, and his arms lightly trembled. He was a supreme expert, yet his power was actually stopped. Those battle clothes were astonishing, enough to allow that youth to advance an entire cultivation realm and fight against him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hong!</span></p>

His golden palm and fingers erupted with golden light that gushed out like a volcano. The light was released in a beautiful yet also berserk manner.&nbsp;</span></p>

The dual flood dragons that his arms produced were completely scattered, and a tremendous wave of power even struck against his chest. It was ferocious and difficult to block.&nbsp;</span></p>

It was covered in formations. These were powerful symbols that had been engraved into his flesh, and they formed all types of killing formations.&nbsp;</span></p>

The power of that fist was not completely neutralized, and it had entered the inside of his body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So powerful!” Qin Fa was astonished. This was still just a youth in Formation Arrangement Realm! When the power of the dark golden battle clothes was eliminated, what laid beneath was his own power.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This confrontation made Qin Fa clearly understand that after merging with the battle clothes, Shi Hao truly could fight against supreme experts. In addition, his original self was incredibly powerful, possessing endless strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shua!</span></p>

This was the force of the powerful formation carved into his flesh. Three hundred and sixty-five swords instantly rushed out and hacked over.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These were the natural laws of a supreme expert, where just a thought could collapse mountains and rivers. For divine swords like these, each one could hack down a king-level figure and destroy enormous mountains.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Three hundred and sixty-five dao swords shone brilliantly as they arranged themselves. It was simply inconceivable!</span></p>

There was only light from the three hundred and sixty-five dao swords in the sky. As they weaved about, it was as if the stars in the sky were smashing downwards.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao shouted loudly and spewed out a stream of light golden liquid. It contained a drop of his essence blood. Then, it evolved into the supreme sword dao, forming a stalk of grass.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hong!</span></p>

In just an instant, it released an everlasting power that surpassed the profoundness of a supreme expert. It was truly astonishing.&nbsp;</span></p>

Its supreme natural laws were raised to an even higher level, producing endless swords radiance. Finally, following the movement of Shi Hao’s hand, it erupted with force and shot out. This was a sky connecting sword radiance, and it hacked down on everything.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A white expanse of sword energy poured down like a flood. It wasn’t just streaks, but instead an expanse that filled the sky as it directly descended.&nbsp;</span></p>

The sword intent that surged from the center of Shi Hao's mind was unmatched, and it stopped the sword formation that a supreme expert had refined for tens of years.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Fa’s expression changed. This sword formation was engraved within his flesh, and it was the pinnacle reflection of its symbols. It was also one of the Immortal Mountain’s extremely well-known offensive techniques. However, right now, it was suppressed, and by another sword intent that even exceeded the Immortal Mountain’s.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finally, the sword radiance completely exploded. The three-hundred and sixty five streaks of divine blades were all wiped out. They formed a stream of light before scattering in the sky. &nbsp;</span></p>

It carried golden symbols within. It flew through the sky, and with a&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">pu&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">sound, it pierced through Qin Fa’s arm.&nbsp;</span></p>

Qin Fa was sent flying horizontally from the attack. Even though it was just a drop of blood, it contained tremendous force, as well as the imperishable sword intent. It almost made his arm and body shatter.&nbsp;</span></p>

The two weaved about and attacked viciously. They were extremely fast, and after just a few clashes, this result was produced.&nbsp;</span></p>

He revealed a serious expression.&nbsp;</span></p>

This was not just the feat of those battle clothes, but rather due to the little Stone being powerful enough. In addition, the sword intent he comprehended wasn’t weaker than his own, to the extent where it was even more powerful.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His predecessors passed down many miraculous methods and left behind many scriptures that were full of endless profound mysterious. However, those that truly comprehended them and reached the corresponding cultivation realm weren’t many.&nbsp;</span></p>

As long as he possessed enough power, he could behead supreme experts. It was definitely not ordinary, and this made Qin Fa feel more and more terrified.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He even thought that if the little Stone was given time, and he engraved enough symbols and formations in his flesh, entering the supreme expert realm was only a few years of effort away.&nbsp;</span></p>

A fifteen or sixteen year old achieving this level was never heard of before in the lower realms.&nbsp;</span></p>

Qin Fa was greatly shaken. The little Stone was simply superhuman, and the potential he displayed was just too shocking.&nbsp;</span></p>

What exactly is going on?” Shi Hao’s killing intent surged around him, and at this moment, his head of black hair was flying about. A biting cold war aura was proliferating in all directions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if there were formations protecting things all around, there were many mountain rocks and enormous trees that left the ground and flew about in midair, trembling with each word Shi Hao spoke. Then, they ultimately exploded.</span></p>

This time, he was truly angry. His grandfather had done so much for him, and he could not hold back his anger.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From a certain perspective, this was the one thing he cared most about.

Ten stalks of grass took root in the sky, and a powerful life force was displayed.&nbsp;</span></p>

He simply couldn’t believe what he was seeing. This was prying into the great dao! It was clearly sword energy and an offensive technique, but right now, it was creating life and evolving the force of vitality.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though the little Stone was in Formation Arrangement Realm, his understanding of the sword dao had long transcended beyond that.

Both sides were swaying, and all types of light danced about. Endless symbols erupted before fading out, and it was as if starry rivers were being formed between the two individuals. It was as if the sun had smashed into the great earth.</span></p>

His arms were broken, and the soles of his feet were shattered. Then, his body continuously cracked apart, and sword energy was continuously produced from his blood.&nbsp;</span></p>
