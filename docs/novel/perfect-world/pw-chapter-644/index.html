Many people were calling out loudly. Everyone’s eyes gathered on their bodies, making them the focal point of all attention.&nbsp;</span></p>

He stood on the carriage and proceeded through this place, triggering everyone’s heated debates. A few young ladies even directly screamed out, crowding forward to get a closer look.</span></p>

Being able to have this kind of child that could overlook ten provinces, it was proper and to be expected that they became a hot topic of discussion.</span></p>

He stood in the corner alone, with no one paying attention to him. He was currently searching for his grandfather.&nbsp;</span></p>

He would likely come to see his own grandson and meet with the only loved ones he has left in the higher realms.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao was extremely worried, fearing that his grandfather would reveal weakness that would then be discovered by others.&nbsp;</span></p>

He felt that his grandfather should be the same, also silently watching his loved ones.&nbsp;</span></p>

It was bustling with activity and packed with people. There were even many divine birds and vicious beasts roaming about, making it hard for him to find his grandfather.&nbsp;</span></p>

They were all province-shaking great sects, so that was why so many extraordinary figures showed up at once.</span></p>

The streets were packed with creatures, all of them cheering and discussing among themselves passionately as exceptional talents and heavenly geniuses descended from the skies one after another. Great commotions continuously broke out.&nbsp;</span></p>

His heart wasn’t stirred up like the ordinary people around him.</span></p>

He didn’t see his grandfather, which meant that Heavenly Country’s assassins wouldn’t easily have their goals realized. However, if it continued like this, how were they supposed to reunite?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Grandfather definitely came. Right now, his mood shouldn’t be too good. I need to see him!” Shi Hao said to himself. He didn’t give up and continued to search through this enormous city.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Five days later, the people that should be present were pretty much all here. Heavenly geniuses all came, and heroic talents emerged one after another. They were all extremely stunning individuals that came from great provinces.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now, it was close to being time for Origin Sky Secret Realm to open. Everything was happening amidst wildly beating gongs and drums. The distinguished meeting was about to start.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This day, regardless of whether it was the inns, restaurants, or other places, they were all incomparably crowded. Too many cultivators came, and this enormous city long ran out of places to stay at. There were just too many creatures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even the small towns a bit further out from the enormous city were filled with people, all for the sake of this distinguished meeting. They were going to come and take a look.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Apart from this, there were many other people eager to give it a try and participate. Instead of being just a bystander, they were going to enter the secret realm and seize some natural luck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, obtaining the qualifications to enter Origin Sky Secret Realm wasn’t that easy either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if it was just a competition to exchange pointers, a meeting called a small-scaled distinguished meeting, the targets of Immortal Mountain’s invitations were all the heavenly talents of a province. It was not easy for ordinary people to participate.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For the sake of making this confrontation a bit more lively, Immortal Mountain did not stop them from entering. The rumor was that apart from the people that were invited, they would allow another four hundred people from the outside world in. There were also other people who were saying that the limit was five hundred.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was because entering the Origin Sky Secret Realm might mean that they could obtain archaic supreme being true blood, divine medicines, inheritances, and other things. They wouldn’t allow too many outsiders to plunge these resources.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This secret realm belonged to Five Elements Province, so only this province’s great sects could send large amounts of their disciples inside.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During these past few days, the sects all consulted with each other to see just how many people they were going to place inside exactly, as well as setting up the regulations and tests. Only outstanding individuals who met the requirements could have a chance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I definitely have to make it inside. Whether or not i can obtain a holy medicine or other natural luck is secondary. The main thing is that I want to observe the exceptional talents’ incomparable great battle. I cannot miss out on this!” Some young experts said. They were extremely excited, feeling that this was a rare opportunity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were others who shook their heads and said, “Do you really think that is some nice place? That is the remains left behind by a supreme being’s nirvana failure, so it will definitely be extremely dangerous. Even though there are special laws that prevent sect master level figures from entering, it is similarly terrifying inside. Rumor has it that there are vicious beasts and fierce birds who have ignited their divine flames inside.”</span></p>
