 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How about we fish one up and cook it?” The Heavenly Horned Ant muttered, completely drunk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Shi Hao really was moved. He had eaten almost everything, just haven’t eaten dragon meat, and there had never been a chance to do so before either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now, he had the opportunity, moreover likely three of them in the Lightning Pool!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, he could only think about such a thing, he knew that it wasn’t realistic. If he truly dared eat dragon meat, perhaps the group of elders in Imperial Pass would eat him first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">True Dragon, this was a type of unmatched fighting strength, ranked first among the Vicious Ten. If there really were heirs left behind, they would definitely be carefully protected and nurtured with everything they had.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, there was a seal on the Lightning Pool applied by Great Elder, perhaps he had long discovered something, fearing that others would act recklessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now, it was impossible to fish up a dragon even if they wanted to!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, everyone felt a feeling of absurdity. These were but dragons, known to be high up above, True Dragons with unmatched fighting strength, yet they actually had a chance to be fished out! They were precisely inside a stone pool!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone looked at Shi Hao strangely. Just how freakish was this fella? He stole a Lightning Pool from heavenly tribulation, and in the end, he seized three dragonlings?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In that instant, everyone was quite speechless, but they could only scream inside. Huang really is a freak!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Lightning Pool really was too rare and special, making everyone rush up and examine it. They all wanted to see a True Dragon as well, all of them extremely curious, even more so shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Eventually, everyone rushed up, all of them giving the Lightning Pool a look. None of them could confirm if this was a True Dragon nest or not.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A world within a mustard seed, this wasn’t much, the True Dragon could naturally do it. Even though the Lightning Pool was small, who could say for sure that it couldn’t store a world inside?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon afterwards, the Lightning Pool became the focal point of conversation. Only, no matter how they discussed things, they couldn’t come to a result.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone felt that it should be given to a Supreme Being like Meng Tianzheng to examine. Someone of his level should be able to understand the truth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">, that light beam is acting quite obediently.” Shi Hao’s focal point was different from the others, he was still looking at the streak of light inside the Lightning Pool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After calming down, it became a dark red color, not moving at all. It rested there just like that, the same color as the immortal killing guillotine. It was extremely sinister and terrifying, making him shiver inwardly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao was thinking to himself, just how he was going to make use of this mysterious divine radiance. Should he refine it into a weapon, or should he merge it into his flesh, smelt it together?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He still felt like nothing external truly belonged to himself, weapons didn’t make him feel as at ease as himself. He began to think to himself how he was going to refine this streak of divine radiance into his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If a portion of his body had this dark red streak of light’s power, then that would be unimaginable!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After half a day of discussions, this place was finally no longer as noisy. Everyone’s mouths finally felt a bit dry, calming down, the matters regarding the Lightning Pool could only be left to supreme beings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the end, this gathering belonged to the younger generation. Shi Hao had heard rumors before he even came, stating that there were invitations sent even into the restricted regions of the Nine Heavens. It was ‘interrupted’ because of his own tribulation crossing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the group of elders took their leave, the gathering gradually returned to the true subject.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We truly gained knowledge and experience today, brother Huang is too heaven-defying, actually able to seize even the Lightning Pool. Only admiration can describe what we feel.” Someone said with a sigh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Speaking of unknown goods, this time, I also brought a strange object that came from the other side. I originally brought it to show it to everyone in this gathering, see if you all can see what exactly it is. Only, previously, brother Huang seized all of the spotlight, so it didn’t seem right to bring it out.” The owner of the Five Spirits War Chariot said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This event originally belonged to the younger generation, for them to discuss the dao. There were even people who brought strange divine objects, news of this going around even before the gathering started.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh? Just what kind of strange thing is it, for even brother Qi to attach so much importance to it?” Someone asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even Ten Crown King, Exiled Immortal, Shi Yi, Great Xu Tuo, Little Sky King, Tuogu Yulong, and other long life families felt rather surprised, looking in his direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, the Lightning Pool disturbance came to an end, the gathering returning to normal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is something an old ancestor from the ancestral altar obtained after taking action outside the pass, fighting a bloody battle with the enemy.” Qi Hong said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When everyone heard this, they all sucked in a cold breath of air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old ancestor he spoke of was currently by the ancestral altar, naturally one of the supreme beings. There were some unmatched beings who had secluded themselves there the entire time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone would always think that they didn’t appear in the world, but in reality, they still went out of the pass in secret to protect great armies. When needed, they would face the matchless figures of the other side!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qi Hong’s Five Spirits War Chariot belonged to an unmatched being. He could be considered the inheritor of a supreme being, even though there was no master and disciple title, there were teachings imparted onto him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For him to be able to obtain something from an unmatched being was naturally not at all surprising.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What exactly is it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When everyone saw him seriously open up a stone case, they all revealed shocked expressions, because resplendent divine multicolored light bloomed. It was too shocking, like a small sun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This thing could actually float in midair, not fall, light as if it had no weight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What was this? Everyone was shocked, the light it released was too resplendent, difficult for one to look directly at it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A few people activated their Heavenly Eyes, narrowing their eyes as they stared at it. It was a golden color, as if the most dazzling gold was burning, shining, mysterious and rare.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, a wave of powerful essence energy was leaked from it, full of vitality, giving many people an extremely comfortable feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was clear that it couldn’t be compared to Lightning Tribulation Liquid, but it definitely exceeded normal spiritual goods. The life energy was too pure, making one feel a wave of alarm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were some who touched it with their hands. It was extremely gentle like jade, sparkling and translucent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was what the master of the Five Spirits War Chariot, Qi Hong, brought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was light as if nothing was there, able to float, endless life essence energy released from it. This was a gemstone that was extremely rare.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It isn’t like the legendary Life Stone from Origin Ancient Mine, definitely not able to compare to it, but this thing is also extremely rare, shockingly precious.” Someone commented.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This thing is naturally astonishing, if a small piece is removed, it can be directly absorbed into the body and refined into the purest essence energy, allowing one’s cultivation to obtain twice the results with half the effort.” Qi Hong said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many people frowned when they heard this. This was definitely not good, because it was brought back from outside the pass, belonging to the other side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If the other side is able to excavate this in large amounts, wouldn’t their cultivation speed far surpass ours?” Someone directly stated the issue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There are still more things that are more frightening than this!” Qi Hong said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His master was a present world supreme being, what he obtained wasn’t only a few pieces of strange stone like this, there was also a jade cauldron, within it a bit of liquid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That light golden liquid is even more terrifying, within it long life qualities, should be from the same source as this type of stone, only, it is liquid, not solidified yet.” Qi Hong said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What… kind of uses does it have? Can it be ingested?” Someone asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It can, but what is shocking is that its greatest use is for sealing!” Qi Hong said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That unmatched being inside the ancestral altar had previously thrown an ordinary ant into this golden liquid, and then when the golden liquid condensed into rock, the ant was naturally forever sealed within.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, they could clearly sense that the ant still didn’t die!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After ten thousand generations passed, it was still like this. Later, when that supreme being opened up the stone, the ant was still alive, no different from when it was still alive back then before it was sealed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone was shocked. This thing happened a long time ago, that supreme being must’ve collected the wondrous stone and mysterious liquid many years ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do the other seniors know about this?” Someone asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Of course, the higher level figures already discussed things a long time ago, moreover have always been researching. They previously even caught a foreign creature to interrogate them.” QI Hong said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It could ensure that something remained inextinguishable, sealed for eternity, this type of liquid was too formidable, uses too astonishing. The more they thought about it, the more they felt that this might change the situation of the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How was this type of thing discovered in the foreign side? Or is it to say that they always had it, that it is the source of their strength?” Someone asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With this type of matter, forget about the liquid, just the condensed wondrous stone was enough to speed up one’s cultivation speed. The energy stored within was just too pure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“After interrogating the foreign creatures, only powerful King Clans knew a bit. One of them said that this was something discovered in the most recent tens of thousands of years, excavated from a mine. There was another who said that this was heaven and earth souce, always existing. There is also a terrifying saying…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Qi Hong reached the last type of terrifying saying, his expression became a bit ugly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone urged him to speak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Anlan, Shutuo, and others had previously excavated an ancient burial ground, seeing what was suspected to be recordings that belonged to an undying emperor, a cultivation realm that exceeded theirs!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was precisely the reason why after endless time, Anlan, Shutuo, and others had always been searching, researching, wishing to understand whether that type of supreme creature existed or not.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">According to the foreign captive, it was precisely because Shutuo was researching the secrets of the ancient supreme individuals that this type of strange stone was discovered, terrifying ancient burial sites continuously excavated, unexpectedly discovering this type of thing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When everyone heard this, they all became stupefied. At the same time, they were extremely shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This type of wondrous stone was discovered after excavating ancient burial regions because Shutuo and Anlan, that level of existence, were searching for something?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were just too many dangers related to ancient burial regions, not even undying beings daring to rashly step foot inside, because there were too many dangers and secrets buried underneath!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Dao brothers, in the future, outside the pass, on the battlefield against the other side, when you see this type of thing, you definitely have to be mindful. They might have great uses!” Qi Hong said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They all began to discuss among themselves, everyone unable to calm down!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only after a long time had passed did something Tuogu Yulong brought out shift everyone’s attention. It was a damaged map that was made from some type of beast skin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was worn down and corroded by time. It had existed for too long, now in tatters, as if it would break apart even if it was blown by wind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tuogu Yulong was extremely careful, flattening it and arranging it on the table. “Everyone, this map is related to a great secret outside the pass, involving great natural luck!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone knew that outside Desolate Border, the world was boundless, that there was a Heavenly Beast Forest, Divine Medicine Mountain, Sea of Loss, immortal ancient lands, to the extent where there were ancient burial regions!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was great natural luck in these places, these rumors were always passed around Imperial Pass.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now, Tuogu Yulong produced a map, still related to outside the pass. According to what he said, this was obtained from the battlefield. Those from the other side previously held this diagram, searching for something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This immediately triggered cries of alarm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It is precisely because of this diagram that I had people send invitations to those from the ancient restricted areas in the Nine Heavens, thus obtaining a response.” Tuogu Yulong said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, everyone was shocked, and then erupted into commotion.</span></p>
