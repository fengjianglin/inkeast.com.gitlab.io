Without a hundred thousand years to recover, they would be ruined and fall right there and then.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Xi stared blankly. She quickly snapped back and understood what Shi Hao was implying. She knew that the situation wasn’t right. She didn’t argue with him, because her staying behind would only be a burden on him. After all, she hadn’t started the ‘Man to heaven’ yet.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao’s attention was concentrated ahead. Multicolored light swirled in the void, covered with broken divine chains of order. There was a woman standing in the taboo area covered in white bones, so how could he not be on his guard?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Were you the one that produced the lightning just now?” The snow-white clothed woman looked at him with interest. Her eyes were filled with specks of light as she transmitted divine sound.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao’s mind trembled. Could it be that he had been discovered by this woman when he fought against the True deity? The Lightning Emperor’s precious technique’s fame and power were extremely well known, so it would easily attract others’ attention.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Light flowed about. A white jade bridge appeared, extending out from the depths of the taboo area towards his feet. A passage was created just like that, one that avoided the chaotic chains of order.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao hesitated, but he still walked over towards the taboo area. The blood-colored ground, the white bones that were everywhere made this place seem like the underworld, yet there were still flowers and plants releasing multicolored light. There was even an exceptional beauty standing on the other side.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao’s eyes swept over the ground. His mind was greatly shaken. He saw that there was a broken cocoon shining, and the surroundings had a few traces of shedding remains. He immediately felt a chill that ran down to his bones.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Could it be that this woman… came out from a cocoon?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His mind was all over the pace. This thought immediately gave him a fright. An exceptional expert had fallen here in the ancient past. Could she be that person?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao stared at the cocoon and came to the conclusion that the cocoon hadn’t been broken for long. He felt nervous inwardly. His heart was shaking. Right now, he was even more terrified than when the War Emperor and old Celestial confronted each other.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His face didn’t change, maintaining a calmness. He played the profound thinker and said, “Too long, these hundred thousand years, the blue sea has turned into mulberry fields. I congratulate dao friend’s successful rebirth.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lightning Emperor, you’ve also reincarnated?” The woman smiled, giving off a breathtaking feeling. Within this underworld of white bones, her white clothes made her extremely beautiful.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao was immediately shaken up. He was stupefied. He originally wanted to try and fool the other person, but he was now absolutely horrified. What kind of background did she have? This was beyond frightening!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“All those years ago when you pledged your loyalty to me, how young you were back then. You ambitions were far-reaching, but now, how did you become so low and foolish, eyes without any brilliance? It is a pity.” The female’s voice was like the sounds of nature as she shook her head with a sigh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao was stupefied. This was an old monster? Why did she sound like the Lighting Emperor’s master? How ancient of a figure was this? It was even more distant than the archaic.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This… might very well be the most ancient existence alive, right?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A single immortal dream, and eras fade away. You still aren’t going to come and pay your respects to your master?” The woman said with a serious expression. “I will help you establish your previous wisdom and reincarnate your memories.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao was stupefied. What was going on? He was the Lightning Emperor’s reincarnation? He felt as if the world was spinning around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You can… recognize me?” Shi Hao summoned his courage and asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“All living things are speaking about how focused you are. You understand the root of things.” The snow white clothed woman’s beautiful eyes were deep. She had an appearance of bemoaning the state of the universe, as if she was pitying the fate of mankind as she looked at Shi Hao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You… understand the past, able to comprehend previous incarnations?” Shi Hao’s mind was in utter chaos. He encountered a taboo existence that understood the past?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“With just a turn of a body, the previous generations would appear, and by looking forward, it is the next life. A will that exists is the present.” The woman’s appearance was dignified, her style unmatched. She was incomparably beautiful and holy. Then she looked at Shi Hao, it was as if she was teaching a junior.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao’s scalp felt numb. He was completely shocked, almost unable to think straight. What kind of heaven connecting existence was this exactly, to have this type of methods?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Disciple, you still aren’t going to pay your respects?” The woman said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao hesitated. Paying his respects to a senior great one wasn’t a loss for him, but his head was in chaos. How did he randomly end up encountering an unrivaled existence?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, he saw that this woman’s spotless white teeth were flickering with luster, the corners of her lips curled up slightly and a trace of craftiness flashing through her eyes. His mind was immediately startled. Things didn’t really seem right!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How could covering up expressions belong to an old freak? This was clearly a quick-witted young lady. He soon understood that he… had been duped instead!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He immediately revealed a look of disdain, revealing discontent. This woman truly wasn’t kind and honest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was clear that this young woman realized that he woke up. She immediately released a shallow smile and said, “Little brat, you still wanted to try and trick me. Are you the good-for-nothing the Devil Blood Ghost Tree was talking about?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao was going to faint. This young lady changed too greatly! She was acting all profound just a moment ago, yet now, she was acting witty, moreover directly talking about Origin Sky Secret Realm’s ancient tree.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Where did the Devil Blood Ghost Tree go?” He asked.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You… came from the vast uninhabited region’s depths?” Shi Hao’s mnd was greatly shaken.&nbsp;</span></p>

This immortal has just left my home. For that old tree’s sake, I won’t beat you. If it was anyone else, I would have definitely hung them up and beat him bad!” This young woman spoke domineeringly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was full of different appearances. When she was quiet, she was exceptional and solitary, but when she moved, she was crafty and quick-witted. When she started spouting nonsense, she then had this type of domineeringness...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Shi Hao heard this, his complexion immediately changed, no longer believing that she came from the uninhabited region.&nbsp;</span></p>
