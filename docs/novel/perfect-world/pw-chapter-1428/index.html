 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One had to bear in mind that the mysterious restricted regions of the Nine Heavens above all remained taciturn. After hundreds of eras passed, Immortal Ancient disappearing, they no longer bothered with mortal affairs, not associating with the outside world at all!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were cut off from the rest of the world, never leaving, just letting time slip away. Even after endless generations passed, eras buried one after another, they still remained completely deathly still.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, everyone knew that there were definitely creatures inside the restricted areas. Those places was a restricted area that couldn’t be set foot into, or else it would signify inevitable death!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After endless years passed, even though everyone knew that there were terrifying creatures inside, no one understood just what races there were inside, or how strong they were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For those of the rest of the world, they were too mysterious, never coming into contact, as if they were people from two different worlds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Today, when they heard Tuogu Yulong’s introduction, how could they not be shocked? There really were invitations sent into the Nine Heavens’ restricted regions, this was a major event!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Will creatures come from those places, arrive in Imperial Pass?” A young cultivator asked, voice not that loud, but everyone paid close attention to this, as this was extremely important.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There is a good chance. It is because they are quite interested in this diagram.” Tuogu Yulong replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Did you meet them in the restricted region? Just what kind of races are they?” Even Ten Crown King couldn’t help but speak up, ask like this, attaching great importance to this matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The ones who were sent out did not see them, only obtaining a response.” Tuogu Yulong said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was already quite something. In the past, no matter how you offered sacrifice, prayed, or worshiped outside the restricted region, no creatures would appear, let alone anyone paying any attention.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, once you entered the restricted area, headed into its depths, there might be a great disaster at any time, danger of being ruthlessly killed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, the messenger not only entered safely, he even obtained a response. This was already extremely rare, expressing a type of attitude from the creatures in the restricted region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The beast skin unfolded, everyone surrounding and examining it carefully. Even though this thing was unbearably tattered, the mountains, rivers and paths could still be differentiated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As soon as they saw it, everyone’s minds sunk. This place was definitely dangerous, not easy to approach.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It is between the Heavenly Beast Forest, ancient burial region, and divine medicine vein, isn’t it surrounded? How are we even supposed to enter? This is simply inevitable death!” Someone said with a sigh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What was the difference between this and a restricted region? Entering rashly would simply result in dying without a burial site.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No, everyone, look, it can be entered through these places, it isn’t completely enclosed.” Tuogu Yulong pointed out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“However, there is a piece of the destination missing. I feel like there are some crucial contents missing, not being marked out.” Someone said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was because everyone saw that the damage was at an extremely crucial point, likely a danger marking. Even now, they could see half a black skull left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This meant extreme danger!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This half black skull was extremely frightening!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone felt like there was additional annotations there, that there should be some type of description, but it was now gone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, the area that was missing wasn’t that small, likely having other danger markings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, the most crucial thing was that on this beast skin map, there were many arrowhead markings, moreover extremely concentrated around the beast skin’s damaged areas, just that they were suddenly cut off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you kidding me? There are so many markings missing, it’ll be really dangerous! I feel like that is the safe path diagram.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Something’s not quite right. Look, why are there a few scattered arrows pointing at the Heavenly Beast Forest, ancient burial region, divine medicine mountain range, connecting them together as well?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone also stared at this, carefully studying it, memorizing the markings on the ancient beast skin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The people above have researched it for a long time, moreover previously sending out experts to search about, but they all disappeared forever, never returning.” Tuogu Yulong said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This made everyone suck in a breath of cold air. After the higher level figures’ research, the people they sent out would definitely be experts, yet they all went missing. This was definitely not normal, making them feel fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were still young, even if their potential was great enough, it didn’t mean that they were suitable for heading out right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do we really know nothing about the destination?” Someone asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We do not know. This beast skin diagram’s damage is too serious, there are no records or descriptions regarding the central crucial area.” Tuogu Yulong said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone knew without thinking too deeply that this diagram was extremely important, or else why would the other side attach this much importance to it, send out a group of mysterious people to search for it? If it wasn’t because something unexpected happened, accidentally running into Imperial Pass’ experts, they really wouldn’t have even known about this matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">En?</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;What happened?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, everyone felt a wave of disorder from the distance. There were people approaching this place. Many people were discussing, shouting something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was an island in Jadefall Lake, only those with invitations could come. Meanwhile, there were many youngsters on shore who didn’t have the qualifications to get on the island, only able to watch from the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was precisely them who raised a disturbance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s… someone came from the restricted region!” Someone cried out, entering the palace and delivering a message, leaving all of the young heroes here shocked, every one of them standing up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were actually people who came from the restricted region! This was just too shocking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They even came while holding special invitations, and that was why they could enter Imperial Pass, head straight here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Were there only creatures from a single restricted region?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite this being the case, it still left everyone shocked, many people walking out of the palace and looking into the distance, first as a type of welcome, but also because they really wanted to see just what the guests from the restricted region were like.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all these years, everyone wanted to know just what kind of race it was who could cut their territories off from the rest of the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On Jadefall Lake, there were creatures who arrived from the distance, treading on water ripples, moving through pure white mists, approaching the island. They were incredibly calm and aloof, everyone paying close attention nervously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finally, they saw them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Momentarily, no one could open their mouths, only staring in that direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were all speechless, finding it difficult to express their mood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was because they were completely different from the restricted region guests they had imagined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In everyone’s knowledge, the creatures of the restricted region were either heroic and extraordinary or sinister and terrifying, extremely unusual, yet when they saw this creature before them, they didn’t know what to say.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn’t a heroic deity, nor was it a beautiful fairy, it was a rooster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, it was an old rooster, one who was extremely large and tall, several zhang in height. Only, the feathers on its body had pretty much all fallen off, many places about to be bald.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only that crest was still bright red like a flame.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Its wings were bare, flesh even visible, its body also in patches, some places having feathers, other places not, revealing its old chicken skin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was why everyone was speechless. This really toppled everything they knew. Was this the creature who came out from the restricted area, belonging to the ones who could intimidate the Nine Heavens Ten Earths?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This rooster’s old eyes were muddled, its movements slow. This was precisely the reason why it still didn’t ascend onto the island even after the disturbance continued for such a long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What a large chicken, living from the past until now, it definitely has endless heaven and earth essence. If it is stewed and made into golden chicken casserole, the taste definitely won’t be bad!” Shi Hao said to Cao Yusheng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, this was done with divine will. Otherwise, everyone in the surroundings would be completely terrified. This was too disgraceful, who dared offend the creatures of a restricted region?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior must forgive us for not coming out to meet you.” Tuogu Yulong said. He was the one who sent out the invitation, which was why he was extremely polite.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the old chicken didn’t express anything, doddering, still just that slow, putting on great airs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior!” Tuogu Yulong called out loudly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, the owner of the Five Spirits War Chariot Qi Hong also spoke up, helping Tuogu Yulong neutralize the awkwardness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if the restricted regions were extraordinary, high up above, they still shouldn’t act this arrogantly. It already entered Imperial Pass, coming for the ancient beast diagram, needing something from another, so acting like this really was a bit inexcusable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cough!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right at this time, a cough sounded. It didn’t come from the rooster, but rather from its back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From there, an elder made his way out from the sparse hair, still drowsy-eyed. “So we’ve arrived…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He used Immortal Ancient language, the words from the last great era, completely different from this era’s!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, soon afterwards, he changed his words, using the language of the present world. He looked at all the youngsters, and then with a faint smile, said, “Little brothers, do not feel estranged!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This mount of mine was affected by an illness from the battle in the past, all five senses pretty much disappearing, so the reason it didn’t hear you all wasn’t because it was putting on airs.” He further explained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, he stood up on this unique mount, revealing his true body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone was stunned. They previously mistook the foreign guest, treating his mount as the main person. However, this person was quite strange as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was an elder who was less than three foot in height, really quite short, like a child, extremely slim figured, and also old. His hair was a dried yellow like withered grass.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His face was covered in wrinkles, one could tell from a single look that his age was terrifyingly great. Only his eyes were still extraordinary, a golden color, no whites or pupils visible, as if they were two golden lamps</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Such a short restricted region guest, less than three foot in height, hair yellow, eyes golden, just what kind of race was it?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, he actually rode on such a strange mount.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">shua</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;sound, the guest jumped off the old rooster, floating onto the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone noticed at this time that his left trouser leg was empty, just fluttering there, clearly missing a calf. This was even more shocking. At this level, the regeneration of broken limbs was but a simple task, so why was he missing a leg?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As if understanding what everyone was thinking, he first customarily spoke some Immortal Ancient language, and then changed again, using the present world language to say, “This was cut off by the enemy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While speaking, he raised the trouser leg, revealing what was inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His left leg was cut at the knee. Moreover, what was terrifying was that there were still blue-colored blood traces, as if it might fall at any time, releasing glaring light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The blue blood definitely didn’t belong to a human, at the very least, he wasn’t pure human, even if he was human shaped!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That injury was extremely smooth, as if cut by a sharp weapon. One could see broken bone, flesh, blood vessels, and other things, forming a smooth surface, the blood flowing precisely from there.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior, did you encounter an enemy attack along the way?” Tuogu Yulong asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This injury was clearly new, still not healing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No, this was left behind from the battle that year, already over a million five hundred thousand years passed since then.” The elder was a bit distracted, somewhat regretful, expression a bit blank. In the end, he shook his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, in everyone’s ears, it wasn’t such a casual phrase, but rather like the sound of thunder, leaving everyone shaken.</span></p>
