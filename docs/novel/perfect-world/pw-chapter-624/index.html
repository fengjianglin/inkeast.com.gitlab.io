It was no longer tainted by the world of mortals. She had beautiful eyes and teeth, and as her white clothes fluttered behind her, she was like a fairy that walked out from a painting.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unknowingly, a pressure was exuded from her body. The power of her soul was astonishing, making even the people like Scholar Tree City’s city master feel great fear.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao narrowed his eyes. He didn’t look in that direction, but he couldn’t calm down. This Yue Chan main body was more powerful than before. She was gorgeous, and an immortal aura was being released by her body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew a long time ago that fairy Yue Chan wasn’t a simple person. There were shocking irregular phenomenons as soon as she was born, which had triggered quite the sensation in the higher realms. Then, she was sealed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back then, he and the witch discovered some clues when they dealt with Yue Chan’s second body. In the depths of her consciousness, there was a charming and exceptional female sleeping. There was an undying life force exuding from her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Does this mean that she had started to unseal the restrictions and released the soul force? Her origins are too astonishing!” Shi Hao sighed inwardly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young great one from Immortal Palace was still as mysterious as before. Symbols covered his entire body, making it hard for one to see his true appearance, but his presence still made everyone incomparably respectful, not daring to look at him face to face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two streaked across the air, as if they were a pair of jade.&nbsp;</span></p>

As expected, she is an unrivaled beauty, beautiful to the point of almost seeming unreal!”</span></p>

There was fear, admiration, and even jealousy. Their expressions were complicated.&nbsp;</span></p>

So many people came and startled so many sects. Did they all come for that silver-haired woman? Exactly what kind of thing happened?” Shi Hao said to himself. He felt that if there was some kind of great natural opportunity, he would most likely be caught up in the disturbance as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Inside the arena, most people wouldn’t pay attention to the changes happening to Scholar Tree City, especially the youth. Their spiritual senses weren’t as strong, so the selection competition continued.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Watch me!” Vermilion Village’s youth walked up. After taking a deep breath, he released a grunt, and then with a rumbling sound, he picked up a great cauldron weighing ten thousand jin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wow!” His peers nearby were all in admiration and shouted loudly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is so special about that?” On the side, someone carried a look of contempt. Python Village’s people walked over. A robust youth grabbed a large cauldron with one hand, and then with rumbling sounds, he raised it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What great power!” Everyone cried out in astonishment, because they came from ordinary tribes. For a teenager to depend solely on his flesh without any symbols and raise a ten thousand jin great cauldron was quite impressive.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The people here speculated that if that Python Village genius used all of his strength and both arms, he shouldn’t have any problems raising a large cauldron weighing thirty thousand jin. It was extremely shocking.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Not bad!” Scholar Tree City’s city master nodded his head in praise and revealed a smile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Group of little spiders, you all are too weak.” Python Village’s youth turned around and looked at Vermilion Village, and then he began to laugh loudly. The people behind him followed in laughter and revealed expressions of ridicule.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let me try!” Vermilion Village’s most powerful youngster appeared. He walked up, and then with a roar, he also raised up the ten thousand jin ancient cauldron with a single hand, leading to exclaims of admiration as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao was extremely calm. Back then, when he was only seven years old and training his body, he had already raised up a hundred jin boulder with a single hand, exceeding his limit.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then, he understood that this country town was just a ‘preliminary event’. This selection competition was mainly to weed out the overly enthusiastic youth without any strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If one believed that they were powerful enough themselves, they could directly head to the prefectural city and participate in the great battle. However, if they did something like that, there was a chance that they might lose their lives.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was why he didn’t participate. If there was truly some great opportunity and he had to participate in a decisive battle, then he’ll just directly head towards the prefectural city.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chi!</span></p>

It shook half the sky. It was actually brilliance that came from someone’s fist. It was incomparably terrifying, the power behind it was world shocking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ah...</span></p>

Five or six individuals were blasted until half their bodies exploded. They fled with their ruined bodies in disarray. They were all supreme experts that had been attacked to this extent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Child of lightning!”</span></p>

As soon as he came into this world, the top of his head shone, and then it immediately suffered a strike of lightning!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was rumored that lightning poured out like an ocean back then, instantly pouring down in torrents. In the end, they were all absorbed by the crown of his head, turning into a symbol that engraved itself into his skull.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a miracle!</span></p>

This implied that he was a child of the heavens. As soon as he was born, instead of harming his body, the lightning helped him refine his body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From that day forth, he was closely connected with lightning. When his fist smashed outwards, endless lightning power would appear. He had never been defeated before.</span></p>

Divine child, please show forgiveness!” An individual cried out loudly.</span></p>

A streak of lightning radiance streaked across, and then that person was completely blasted apart. He first turned into a bloody mist, and then he became scorched ashes.&nbsp;</span></p>

This individual was too formidable, not even treating supreme experts as anyone special. They were clearly at the same cultivation realm, but it was so easy for him to kill them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Worthy of being the child of lightning.” Someone sighed and said.&nbsp;</span></p>

This child of lightning received the protection of the heavens. He suffered a thunder strike as soon as he was born, but not only did he not die, a symbol condensed on his skull.

The flames were made of symbols, mysterious and holy in appearance. This was a young man. He was somewhat indistinct as he sat within, but Shi Hao could feel how powerful this individual was. There was a divine lamp at his shoulder that swirled with a mysterious energy that filled the void. He could actually stand against Immortal Palace’s young great one, so it was quite clear just how terrifying he was.&nbsp;</span></p>
