Shi Hao had escorted her for hundreds of thousands of li, paying the cost of blood to do so, yet he became a prisoner of the Celestial Clan. Now, he was actually here, the two of them encountering each other in this type of situation. Shi Hao was ridiculously powerful, cutting down the Celestial Clan’s exceptional heavenly talent You Yu, making tremendous waves rise and fall within Yun Xi’s mind…</span></p>

He understood all of the inside details.&nbsp;</span></p>

He is Huang, the one that ascended my Goddess Academy’s Heavenly staircase?” When a few students heard this, they were all shaken up. They began to reveal a dumbstruck expression.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This great senior brother…” Many people were speechless. They had previously showed him disdain, wanting to muster large forces to suppress this dishonorable fella. How could they have known that his identity was so great? The so-called small shoddy monastery’s disciple was just a cover. He truly couldn’t be provoked!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He passed Goddess Academy’s Heavenly staircase?!” When the cultivators of all sects heard this, another uproar was created. This place was extremely noisy.</span></p>

Their greatest test had naturally drawn the interests of a few other sects, and they had previously learned about it in detail. Who didn’t understand the difficulty of the Heavenly staircase? During these endless years, no one could make it through this trial.</span></p>

Being able to succeed is still within reason!”</span></p>

It was only because this person was Huang; it was already enough.</span></p>

It was full of different colors, releasing a dazzling rain of light that rushed into the clouds, surrounding this place. It was spotlessly white like jade, then scarlet red like the sunset glow, then purple energy surged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Heaven’s mandate stone; it was only the size of a fist, but the fluctuations it released were extremely terrifying. It was as if great waves were surging, making the ancient trees in this mountain region rise and fall, sway back and forth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, its radiance was just too brilliant. When it was scarlet, it would dye the entire heavens red, when it was purple, it was as if purple energy rose from the east, as if great clouds were falling downwards.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Holy energy pervaded the air. Brilliance was released in tens of thousands of streaks, erupting from within Shi Hao’s palm.</span></p>

Just now, they didn’t rashly take action and just coldly watched.</span></p>

The Celestial Clan’s younger generation experts felt great pain inwardly, feeling incomparably furious.&nbsp;</span></p>

You deserve the wrath of heaven!” A deity said coldly.</span></p>

There were too many creatures, so there was no way they all thought the same thing. However, there was no way paper could wrap around fire. As for what the truth really was, it would be revealed sooner or later.&nbsp;</span></p>

I saved your clan’s heavenly woman, but I was imprisoned within your City of Heaven, locked way in the black prison all because your clan plotted after my precious techniques. Is there anything more shameless than this, a clan that kicks their benefactors in the teeth?!” Shi Hao loudly berated.</span></p>

However, Shi Hao believed that by denouncing and saying this to the Celestial Clan’s face, even if it wasn’t the truth and fake, it would still make people think and from there on discuss this matter. In the end, the Celestial Clan’s face would be covered in grime, badly burned from head to toe.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the distance, Yun Xi lowered her head, her face red, feeling extremely uncomfortable inside.&nbsp;</span></p>

I was just collecting a bit of interest from you. However, your Celestial Clan truly is declining, called an Emperor race in vain. Your so-called experts are all like dogs and chickens, and even your so-called young supreme being is so lacking, unable to take a single blow!”</span></p>

It would make a sect feel defeated and humiliated. Right now, many people from the Celestial Clan were trembling and clenching their fists tightly.&nbsp;</span></p>
