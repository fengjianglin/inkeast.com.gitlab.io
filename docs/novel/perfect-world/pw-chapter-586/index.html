This first attack had not ended yet. He turned into a human-formed Kun peng and rushed upwards. With wings behind him, he displayed the Kun Peng technique. Endless symbols appeared and attacked outwards.&nbsp;</span></p>

Divine radiance erupted endlessly.&nbsp;</span></p>

Now, equipped with the Deity Realm and Imperishable Golden Body, it became even faster.&nbsp;</span></p>

In his surroundings, endless black sunflowers appeared. They grew frantically to block Shi Hao’s attacks.&nbsp;</span></p>

He grabbed one of the magical artifacts around him. It was the country protecting divine halberd that was dark black to golden in color. It released blazing radiance. It hacked horizontally and vertically, wiping out many of the black sunflowers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This place became chaotic. All types of lights flew about in disorder.&nbsp;</span></p>

His head of hair stood on end, and his pupils widened angrily. The great halberd in his hands hacked down ferociously. With the Kun Peng’s power, it erupted with the greatest offensive power.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This male roared angrily. He had also become furious. Countless symbols appeared around him, and a great sun erupted behind his body. The demonic sunflower he refined himself appeared to block the divine halberd.&nbsp;</span></p>

The great black sun swayed back and forth. Some of its leaves withered, turning into black flames that burned viciously. They surrounded towards Shi Hao.&nbsp;</span></p>

A pair of Kun Peng wings moved behind him. Endless energy erupted, and both yin and yang energies swirled, scattering the flames. He slaughtered his way forward. The dazzling halberd blade and boundless Kun Peng force erupted at the same time, turning into a lightning of destruction. The powerful electricity surged forward.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Peng!</span></p>

Under this tyrannical type of power, even he would suffer greatly.&nbsp;</span></p>

He didn’t have any route of retreat, and he had to fight and win to break out of this deadly situation. This was the only way to come out alive.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, under the sudden changes, the Demonic Sunflower Garden male who was originally confident in his victory and acting high and mighty suddenly began to panic. He didn't want to be wounded, or else how was he supposed to contend for supremacy here in the lower realm and obtain the greatest benefits? He was afraid that after he became weak, he would be eliminated by the other deities.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was precisely this attitude that made Shi Hao even more confident. Meanwhile, the black clad male continuously backed up in retreat.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pu</span></p>

It turned into a streak of divine rainbow light and pierced through that man’s shoulder, causing blood to spill all over the deity’s body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ah…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">” The black clad male cried out loudly, revealing a look of anger. He was so powerful, yet he was wounded by this ‘glimmer of light’. He was completely furious now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew that he had to turn this situation around, or else the results would be unthinkable. His entire body shone and divine flame blazed about. He erupted with the most powerful aura.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A black sunflower appeared. It turned into a black heavenly sun and surrounded him. He was going to fight a decisive battle against Shi Hao. In addition, hundreds to over a thousand streaks of black light flew towards Shi Hao, putting him in extreme danger.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were actually sunflower seeds, every one of them carrying a wave of spiritual essence as they shot out. They then exploded in midair, turning into sword radiance. Injuries appeared on Shi Hao’s face and neck. He had just been brushed by this attack, yet they almost pierced straight through him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, the black clad male backed up. He wanted to create a safe enough distance to readjust himself before continuing the fight.</span></p>

He was like a shadow following a body, not allowing him to break free from this place. The Kun Peng technique was displayed to its limit. Those divine wings moved about, forming yin and yang energies. They both erupted with the most powerful offensive power.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hong!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dang!&nbsp;</span></p>

That was his main body. Black symbols rippled outwards and quickly diffused. The leaves flying about in chaos continuously withered and sparks flew everywhere.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ah…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">” He roared, displaying his great divine ability. His entire figure began to burn; he was going to fight to the death.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Go die!”</span></p>

He pressed forward, both wings slamming together, merging yin and yang. There was actually some chaotic energy that scattered outwards. Power surged greatly. This was this technique’s greatest offensive skill.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hong!</span></p>

Both wings struck down on his arms, leaving his entire body greatly shaken. The sunflower in front of him withered up, and his arms immediately exploded. The injuries were quickly worsening as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pu</span></p>

Even though Shi Hao wasn’t a true deity, he still produced this terrifying result.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">You have to understand that a creature with their divine flame ignited would be completely different. They would possess power far exceeding that of the mortal realms. The king level figures and supreme experts could only look up to them and offer their worship.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was also because of the large disparity in strength, the great gap between them, that earned them the title of deities. They were too difficult to defy.&nbsp;</span></p>

What was Shi Hao going to do? Soon after, she learned a few things from the village and became extremely shocked. He actually… slaughtered a deity!</span></p>

This time, life and death was difficult to say. His actions seemed like funeral arrangements.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you truly going to go and fight?” Yue Chan asked. She was truly amazed. The little Stone didn’t kill her, and if he was defeated, he would finally leave her with a path of life.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her state of mind immediately became extremely complicated.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao didn’t pay her any attention. He called over Qingfeng and told him about a few special places in the lower realm that might contain great natural opportunities. These were were the places deduced by the higher realms’ sect masters, so if the country became powerful enough in the future, they could go and explore those areas.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little big bro, don’t leave again.” Qingfeng shed tears. He couldn’t help but choke with sobs. He knew that this final deity was the most powerful and unrivaled. If Shi Hao went and fought him head on, he would most likely die.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t go, there’s no way to win over the last deity. He came from Immortal Palace, an ancient freak that has cultivated for a long time. You aren’t his opponent.” Hairy Ball also sighed and said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If I had a choice, I definitely wouldn’t go.” Shi Hao said. Who wouldn’t cherish their own life and not care about death? He naturally didn’t want to meet death either.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was hoping that the old deity would focus on searching for natural opportunities and roam the world instead of dealing with him. That way, they could both live together in harmony.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little Uncle Hao, you aren’t going anymore? Go with us to the mountains to loot some vicious bird nests and catch vicious beasts.” A group of children shouted noisily.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, I’ll go with you guys.” In the next few days, Shi Hao roamed about the mountains with them, leaving behind many cries of joy and laughter, as if he had returned to his childhood.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His smile was extremely brilliant. He truly wanted to stay behind, truly wanted to stop this moment of time.&nbsp;</span></p>
