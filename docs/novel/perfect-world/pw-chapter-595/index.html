Purple energy pervaded the air. Immortal Mountain was great and majestic.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mist curled peaks could be seen one after another. One could vaguely see a few ancient trees that were flowing with multicolored light. This place was like a paradise.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sound transmitted far into the distance, resounding through the mountain like thunder. However, Qin Hao’s reply never came.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A dark red line could be seen at the corner of Shi Hao’s lips. Blood flowed out, and even if he swallowed it back down, it wouldn’t help. Just the slightest bit of force caused this, so it could be seen just how severe his injuries were.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the surroundings, everyone revealed looks of surprise. They could tell that the little Stone wouldn’t last much longer. He had fought a great battle against deities and paid an incredible price. He might die today!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There were rumors stating that he went to fight against the most powerful deity. Could it be that he successfully killed the last deity?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they thought of this, the hearts of everyone in Immortal Mountain began to pound, feeling their souls trembling. How terrifying of a result was this? It was too shocking.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If this proved to be true, then it would definitely be a miracle!</span></p>

Perhaps one more cut would end his life.&nbsp;</span></p>

They secretly stored up power. If needed, they would work together to carry out the final fatal attack.&nbsp;</span></p>

His fingers slightly exerted force, and that supreme expert’s neck began to release&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">ka cha</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;sounds. Cracks appeared on the bones, leaving everyone shocked and so terrified their faces changed color.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Immortal Mountain couldn’t stand this. If the last supreme expert died too, how were they supposed to exert any pressure in the lower realm? They couldn’t allow this supreme expert to die.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Stone Clan’s emperor, do not act too rashly. If there is something to say, we can discuss it.” An elder stepped forward in a rush, cupping his hand in apology, telling Shi Hao not to take action.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The others all collected their auras before backing off. Even though the little Stone was gravely injured, if he was truly angered, killing the supreme expert in his hands wasn’t a problem.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao pointed outwards. Divine force surged, sealing that supreme expert, temporarily turning his body’s power into nothingness. The supreme expert’s face became incomparably pale, and his body was lightly trembling.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Younger brother, are you here? Come out so we can meet.” Shi Hao transmitted his voice again, using his foundational divine force. The sound of bone cracking could be heard, clearly cracking again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was like broken chinaware. Even though he had been put together, the slightest bit of force would cause him to split apart again. He was in an extremely dangerous state.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sound of the sky shattering could be heard. A youngster wearing silver magical clothes appeared. He descended from the sky. His silver battle clothes shone, making him look holy and otherworldly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was only twelve or thirteen years old, so he wasn’t old at all. However, he was incomparably quiet. When his eyes opened and closed, divine radiance seeped out. His black hair scattered outwards, making him look brave and heroic. This was precisely Qin Hao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Hao frowned and said, “What happened to you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao suppressed his injuries and said, “Have them all go away. I have things to say to you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Hao nodded and said, “Follow me into Immortal Mountain.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though these people bore hostility, they all suppressed their emotions and no longer stopped Shi Hao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On top of a mountain peak, a clear spring rippled about. Pine trees could be seen everywhere. The two brothers sat together. Shi Hao didn’t hide anything, telling him that his life was going to end soon.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Hao looked at him and said, “It cannot be cured?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I understand my current situation clearly. Even holy medicines are useless at this point.” Shi Hao shook his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Hao became silent. Then, he said, “What do you wish for me to do?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Take care of mother and father. I don’t have anyone else to ask.” When Shi Hao finished speaking this sentence, he stood up. He hadn’t known this little brother of his for a long time. The other party never liked to talk much, so he didn’t want to waste time here.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The world is so large. Who knows if there are some ancient methods that can save you.” Qin Hao spoke.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I know.” Shi Hao nodded. He gave his little brother another look. Qin Hao had to properly look after his mother and father… this was one of his heart’s greatest concern, something he felt the most unease towards.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t worry. They will definitely live happily. Even if we entered the higher realms, no one would dare provoke us.” Qin Hao said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao sighed lightly. His eyes contained a bit of reluctance. “Since that is the case, I feel reassured. Don’t tell them my things, just say that I went to cultivate in isolation. You all should head for the higher realms soon.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew that now that the immortal bone was successfully planted in Qin Hao’s body, he was definitely going to leave.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, he wasn’t willing to let his parents learn of his current situation. Otherwise, he would only leave behind sadness. He wanted to leave for the distance alone, and find a peaceful place to finally bury himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instead of leaving behind the sorrow of being forever separated by life and death, he would rather leave his parents with a lie, have them think that he was cultivating and temporarily left.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Hao looked at him without saying anything. They sank into a period of silence.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright!” Qin Hao nodded.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao walked out of Immortal Mountain along the bluestone road. He didn’t turn back. He wanted to find a peaceful place to wait for his final moment to come.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Alone the way, no one stopped him, allowing him to leave.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Outside the mountain gate, the world was incredibly wide. Boundless fields stretched outwards. Shi Hao stood here while watching the mountains and surging rivers. He suddenly felt some indecisiveness, not knowing where to go.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Returning to Stone Village isn’t a good choice either.” He sightly softly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They will feel incredibly broken-hearted.” Qin Hao still followed out in the end, standing behind him and saying this. It was clear that he was talking about Shi Ziling and his wife.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s fine as long as you don’t tell them. Either way, you are going to go into the higher realms, so have them go with you.” Shi Hao didn’t turn around.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He stood there for quite some time. He thought back to the things that happened in the past, deciding that it was still best to return to the great wastelands where Stone Village was. He would bury himself several tens of li away, but he wouldn’t let them see him. He wanted to remain in the place where he grew up.&nbsp;</span></p>

Her face was filled with terror. She grabbed his hand.
