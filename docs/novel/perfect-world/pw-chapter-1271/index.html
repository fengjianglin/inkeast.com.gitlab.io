 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A purple sun suspended in the air, divine flames surging, purple energy released by the thousands and tens of thousands of streaks, covering the void.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Heavenly monarch is unmatched, shattering all legends!” Many people shouted out. They looked towards that purple heavenly sun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Among these people, many were young women, no lack of pearls from great clans. They shouted loudly for Purple Sun Heavenly Monarch, extremely excited.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were also some men, for example, Wu Tai, who had a sneer at the corner of his lips. He was full of expectation, really wanting to see the scene of Huang’s defeat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He suffered a great defeat in Realm Tomb, having the azure armor seized, nursing hatred until now, constantly thinking about revenge and how to erase his humiliation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The attendant also shouted with a shrill voice, “Master, you definitely have to suppress him! What Huang, what undefeated legend? What does this all count as? Once master steps out, he will inevitably die!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jin Jiaoxi widened his eyes, his golden pupils releasing deep divine light. He was quite stirred up. If Purple Sun Heavenly Monarch suppressed Shi Hao, then he would be completely at ease. He also released a low roar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, this place became noisy, becoming incredibly lively. Many experts hurried over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The great purple sun moved slowly. When it was not that far from Shi Hao, only then did it stop moving. The indistinct figure within released matchless divine might!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Great Mist Purple Energy Seed, known to be unmatched through Immortal Ancient!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All those who have merged with this seed in history were the strongest in the Nine Heavens Ten Earths, absolutely stunning. There were too many legends related to it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, all eyes were staring at that great purple sun in the air, all of their heads raised, feeling great respect and reverence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Purple Sun Heavenly Monarch became the focal point, standing in the air, his blurry figure like an unrivaled immortal, matchless under the sky, overlooking the masses. The great purple sun around him released terrifying flames of light that flourished with increasing brilliance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A few people were trembling, couldn’t help but bow down in worship.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was because the radiance that great purple sun released formed ripples that undulated out, making many powerful individuals tremble with fear, their souls even pounding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, on the other side, Shi Hao stood there calmly, the corners of his clothes fluttering in the wind, somewhat weak looking, a bit cold and cheerless. It was as if there was an aloof aura to him, but he just looked like he was missing some domineeringess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, everyone’s eyes were concentrated on the large purple sun, staring at that heavenly monarch. Aside from Cao Yusheng, Chang Gongyan, little rabbit and others, there weren’t many who were paying attention to Shi Hao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was because the crowd already reached the final conclusion that Huang was definitely going to be defeated today. Even if he used to be glorious and unmatched, he would soon become a stepping stone for Purple Sun Heavenly Monarch.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A few people sighed, feeling regret for him. Huang’s legendary reputation might be completely destroyed today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were some whose lips curled into a sneer, waiting for the moment when he was humiliated and defeated to arrive, for example, Wu Tai, the attendant, Jin Jiaoxi, and others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Come then, a battle at the Heavenly Deity Realm. Huang, let me see just how strong you were before, if you deserved your reputation!” Purple Sun Heavenly Monarch’s voice was cold, ruthless, making one feel a wave of pressure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Shi Hao!” From behind him, the Lunar Jade Rabbit, Cao Yusheng, Feng Wu, and the others all revealed looks of worry. Even if it was a confrontation at the heavenly deity level, it was still difficult to say what would happen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was because after the other party merged with a perfect seed, his body underwent a comprehensive evolution, crushing the heavenly deity realm. Meanwhile, the inner quality of his body remained the same.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t worry.” Shi Hao laughed towards them. He began to move forward, facing that great purple sun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finally, it was about to start. Everyone felt extremely nervous, a few eyes starting to look towards Shi Hao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He actually dares to face the enemy head-on?” On Immortal Academy’s side, a few people said, the words quite stinging.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heh heh</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">, I mean this is Huang we are talking about, someone who used to be the young supreme being of a generation, so how could he feel no shame and just withdraw? He has to fight to the end no matter what?” Wu Tai said, taking delight in his disaster. He finally waited until this moment, really wishing to see the scene of Shi Hao’s miserable defeat.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one thought that things were going to end well for Shi Hao. Regardless of whether it was Immortal Academy’s people who were hostile towards him, or those who were unrelated, they all felt that after Purple Sun Heavenly Monarch merged with the dao seed, he was unmatched regardless of what cultivation realm he was in!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Truly is a pity. He had his time of glory before as well, but he is going to quietly fall just like this!” Even the somewhat timid Jin Jiaoxi began to speak up, feeling extremely excited.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s nothing to worry about at all, now that master is taking action, no one can stop him. From here on out, Huang is definitely going to be knocked down from his pedestal!” The attendant sneered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right at this time, a loud noise sounded. Everyone closed their mouths, because a wave of great dao energy flowed about, leaving everyone greatly alarmed. They all felt uneasy inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The large purple sun slowly moved about, as if it had existed for an endless amount of time, as if it slowly moved over from the depths of the cosmos’ stellar stream, descending into the world of mortals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was produced by Great Mist Purple Energy. It was incredible ancient to begin with, the years impossible to measure!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, it wrapped around Purple Sun Heavenly Monarch, carrying mysterious dao laws. It rumbled down, crushing down towards Shi Hao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, auspicious energy overflowed, purple energy released in ten thousand streaks. It was as if the mountains and rivers were roaring, the sounds world-shaking. The scene here was shocking to the extreme.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Was this even power at the heavenly deity level?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone’s minds trembled, this power even more frightening than some sect masters. How was one supposed to face this? It was simply like the roar of an undying being!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right at this time, Shi Hao moved, slowly pushing into the void. The purple energy that covered heaven and earth began to surge within his palm, releasing the sounds of wind and thunder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The purple energy that swept towards him scattered, unable to approach his body!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone’s eyes narrowed. In the Heavenly Deity Realm, Huang had unmatched style after all. Was not even the current Purple Sun Heavenly Monarch able to deal with him?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If nothing unexpected happened, the two of us would not have crossed each other, no chance of clashing, but I always wanted to have a look at you in your most glorious time, what you really were like!” Purple Sun Heavenly Monarch said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His meaning was clear. If nothing unexpected happened, then in the sect master level, he felt that it was beneath him to cross hands with Shi Hao. it was because the other party lost the qualifications to become his opponent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, his hands and feet were bound. Only by restricting his cultivation to the Heavenly Deity Realm could the two barely be a match.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You are too self-confident!” Shi Hao said with an ordinary tone. He only had this sentence, not refuting anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huang, you should just do your best. I hope you don’t disappoint me!” Purple Sun Heavenly Monarch shouted, his voice like thunder in summer, deafening. Then, he dove down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In that instant, the sun and moon lost luster, the mountains and rivers losing color. This world began to rumble about, the void rupturing open!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The large sun created by the Great Mist Purple Energy surrounded him. He quickly swooped down, as if the stars from outer space were smashing downwards, bringing a type of incomparable might and pressure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Honglong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Purple light covered the sky, the world was submerged within!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Terrifying energy surged like a sea. This was a type of unmatched great power that couldn’t be changed, able to suppress all!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone was stunned. Was this the true strength of Purple Sun Heavenly Monarch? He was just about unmatched in the Heavenly Deity Realm, if he wasn’t suppressed, just how astonishing would he be?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The powerful all saw that the figure below was drowned in purple energy, almost no longer visible. That was Huang, he looked extremely frail, extremely delicate, making others sympathize with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Was it going to end just like this? It was because Purple Sun Heavenly Monarch’s might was too strong, several times more frightening than the Nine Netherworlds Ao Shi Hao faced in the past!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In Cao Yusheng’s eyes, this simply left one in despair. The Lunar Jade Rabbit, Feng Wu, and the others’ faces were pale. They were already extremely worried before, but now, they felt even more like Shi Hao was most likely finished, that there was danger to his life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I just knew that Huang was not good enough now, he isn’t worth anything. He’ll be captured by master soon!” The attendant laughed loudly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heh heh,</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Huang, turns out there’s a day when even you will be like this. Do you see now? Purple Sun Heavenly Monarch’s strength is several times greater than yours back then, you’re not good enough!” Wu Tai laughed, feeling extremely carefree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is only the beginning, but is it already going to end?” Someone laughed loudly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The purple sun released strand after strand of divine multicolored light, tearing through everything below, gradually submerging everything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At first, that place was still calm, but later on, everyone felt that something wasn’t right. Why was it that after that purple sun descended, it still surrounded that area, couldn’t truly blast it to pieces?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sure enough, the oppression was broken through. A tall and slender figure produced a fist imprint below the purple sun, and then with tremendous strength, smashed it into that great purple sun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, the auspicious energy and purple energy couldn’t cover that area anymore, completely blasted through!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the end, a streak of thunder tore through the void, shattering heaven and earth, erupting!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The figure below the purple sun appeared. Shi Hao was still delicate and handsome, looking otherworldly, but when he took action, it was extremely domineering. That fist looked simple and ordinary, not releasing light, but it smashed the great purple sun until it shook, about to fall apart!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone was horrified, this place immediately becoming dead silent, so quiet a falling pindrop could be heard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What was going on? Just now, they still saw Purple Sun Heavenly Monarch stirring the divine sun, pressuring Shi Hao, but in the blink of an eye, everything changed, that great sun even smashed to pieces!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ones who were still mocking and speaking coldly all shut their mouths, feeling a wave of chilliness run through their minds. Every single one of them stopped talking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even the attendant closed his mouth, watching nervously, Wu Tai even more so looked like a duck with its throat cut, his voice coming to a grunting stop. There were others that shivered inwardly as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huang was even stronger than before!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were both in the Heavenly Deity Realm, but he was even more formidable than before!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many people felt great waves stir within them, their thoughts all over the place. When they looked at Shi Hao, none of them knew what to say. This person who used to be a supreme being was too pitiful. Why didn’t he obtain an ancient seed?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if the other geniuses were making progress, transforming after obtaining precious seeds, advancing rapidly, Huang still didn’t fall behind, still possessing world-shaking aptitude in the Heavenly Deity Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Another great noise sounded. Shi Hao moved his arms, like a Kun Peng spreading its wings, he released incomparable might, shaking up the entire place!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He blasted that purple great sun until it cracked apart, and then rushed into midair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shua!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The great sun cracked apart, turning into tens of thousands of streaks of purple energy, auspicious energy surging, filling up heaven and earth.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I said I won’t use the power of a higher cultivation realm, so this purple energy can’t be used, only affecting my battle. I will put it away!” Purple Sun Heavenly Monarch said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, all of the purple energy was withdrawn, but his true appearance still couldn't be seen, because it was surrounded by sparkling purple light, even his face indistinct.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, everyone could already see his body, tall and straight, purple hair scattering down, eyes like cold streaks of lightning. He was extremely handsome and heroic in appearance, possessing a type of peerless domineeringness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was different from before when he was talking calmly, his appearance now grand and imposing, domineering and powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Huang, come and fight. Do not disappoint me!” Purple Sun Heavenly Monarch dove back down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Immediately afterwards, everyone felt as if lightning tangled about them, thunder rumbling.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Purple Sun Heavenly Monarch took action, it was like thunder, fast like lightning, instantly exchanging a thousand blows with Shi Hao.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Behind him appeared an extremely terrifying purple Qilin, as if it was going to obliterate the world.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Purple Sun Heavenly Monarch immediately displayed one of the Vicious Ten precious techniques, one could imagine just how great his family’s background and resources were.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, before the attendant released a cheer, right at that time, the purple phoenix’ stomach swelled, and then a thunderous noise sounded. In the end, it exploded!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Light shone resplendently there, extremely blinding. A human shape Kun Peng emerged. Shi Hao formed a fist imprint, the power unstoppable. Regardless of whether it was the phoenix feathers or phoenix bone texts, nothing could stop him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Peng!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He tore open the True Phoenix’ stomach with an unmatched fist imprint, breaking free. Even though this wasn’t Purple Sun Heavenly Monarch’s real stomach, it still inflicted serious damage. The phoenix bird shrunk in size, revealing his true body. Then, he flew outwards!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Peng!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Purple Sun Heavenly Monarch was struck flying, coughing out large mouthfuls of blood, falling headfirst in the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a world-shaking great battle. No one was able to count just how many moves were exchanged, because their speeds were too fast. Was it going to end just like this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Purple Sun Heavenly Monarch stood up, his face cold, wishing to keep fighting. However, he clenched his teeth, not continuing in the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those people who originally planned to cheer were all silent, all of them dumbstruck and at a loss for words. There was actually this type of result!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Still want to fight?” Shi Hao asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When this sentence sounded, Purple Sun Heavenly Monarch’s brows stood up vertically, his fists tightly clenched.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the others, they didn’t know what to say. The ones who were speaking against Shi Hao all had their mouths tightly shut, finding it difficult to open them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heh heh… haha…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">” The little rabbit was the first one to laugh, moreover an extremely unbridled great laughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, Cao Yusheng and the others all began to laugh one after another, this laughter extremely ear-piercing in the ears of everyone from Immortal Academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Haha,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">we won, Huang has achieved a great victory! Purple Sun Heavenly Monarch is not a match for my Heavenly Deity Institution’s Huang!” Heavenly Deity Institution’s disciples shouted loudly, feeling incredibly excited.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You all should act less complacent. What can this battle count as?!” The attendant cried out. He found this result extremely hard to accept.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What is there to laugh about?!” Wu Tai was also annoyed, expressing his annoyance, roaring loudly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Peng!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao took action, still a finger, quickly enlarging, crushing down on the attendant’s body, snapping his bones and tearing apart his muscles. He flew outwards, half crippled once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You…” The attendant was shocked and furious, large mouthfuls of blood coughed out from his mouth. He glared out angrily, but Shi Hao felt that it was beneath him to pay this person any more attention, directly sending him flying with another kick.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He took action like this in front of Purple Sun Heavenly Monarch’s face, not showing any mercy, making the attendant’s muscles and arteries snap, leaving everyone shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Noisy!” Shi Hao only had this word to say.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Peng!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, Shi Hao formed a fist imprint. With a single strike, Wu Tai was blasted until his bones broke inch by inch. He flew outwards, almost turning into a bloody paste. He couldn’t avoid this strike at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Also you, come over, let me have a taste of Golden Horned Rhinoceros.” Shi Hao chased after the distant Jin Jiaoxi, leaving it absolutely terrified.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone was stupefied. Huang didn’t feel any misgivings, acting so unrestrained right in front of Purple Sun Heavenly Monarch’s face, not caring about his presence at all!</span></p>
