This was definitely a major event, especially because Underworld Child was not an ordinary exceptional talent. He came from Underworld Earth, and his power was extremely powerful.&nbsp;</span></p>

They looked in this direction, their eyes passing over the lakes and beautiful mountain peaks, piercing through the hazy mist to look in this direction.</span></p>

He grabbed Grandpa Fifteen’s arm, and his eyes turned red. After experiencing so many difficulties, he was finally reunited with his grandfather.</span></p>

He felt incomparably grieved and bitter. To have his own grandchild die before him was a truly painful thing.&nbsp;</span></p>

The grandson he longed to meet the most had died. This was a great mental shock to him.</span></p>

Old tears rolled down his face. The reunion today had happened too suddenly, and he almost couldn’t believe it. This was a miracle, one that consoled his dejected heart.</span></p>

A powerful figure appeared, one with golden armor that radiated cold black light. There was a deathly aura around him. A pair of eyes opened in the darkness, ice cold and ruthless.&nbsp;</span></p>

They felt a wave of ice-cold and life-less fluctuation. They immediately felt an ominous feeling, as well as fear.&nbsp;</span></p>

This individual was cruel and cold. Ever since he returned, he didn’t say a word. Black underworld mists surrounded him, making them all feel unwell.</span></p>

Who was Underworld Child? He came from a desolate and ice-cold place of death. Some people called that place the ‘Underworld’.&nbsp;</span></p>

He had extraordinary battle successes, defeating all those in his past. In this present world, there were still none who could stop him!</span></p>

This was also an act of trying to help the youth save face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A youth…” Underworld Child said coldly. Right now, he had already calmed down and no longer showed neither anger nor dismay. He was cold and callous, as if he didn’t feel any emotions.&nbsp;</span></p>

Forget about the cultivators that were always watching the situation here, even the people who weren’t as familiar with things knew that this was not ordinary!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young devil king immediately became the focal point of everyone’s discussions.

The mysterious expert that appeared in Five Elements Province recently was the only one that seemed to match this description. He left his name on the Demonic Sovereign’s divine monument, suppressing Qin Changsheng in power and overlooking all ten provinces.&nbsp;</span></p>

I want to go back.” Underworld Child said in a heavy tone. There were black mists curling about him, as well as the aura of Underworld Earth. He was going to enter the secret realm again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the depths of the secret realm, the lake region.&nbsp;</span></p>

He was stirred up and excited to the extreme, because he thought that his grandson had died, which made him feel inwardly grieved. How could he have predicted that a living grandson would appear in front of him today?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Inside a remote place, the grandfather and grandson arranged a formation together, separating themselves from the outside world, and then they revealed their true appearances.</span></p>

The Great Demonic God was fifty or sixty in age and should be in his golden age, surging with blood energy and vitality, but right now, his hair was white, and the corners of his eyes carried many fine wrinkles.

It made him feel extremely bad. His grandfather had gone through so many difficulties during these past few years.&nbsp;</span></p>

His grandfather’s arm could be regrown. One could regrow their flesh upon entering the supreme expert realm, but recently, he had been in an extremely sorry state, constantly pursued by Heavenly Country, so he didn’t take the time to reconstruct his real body.</span></p>

He personally examined his grandfather, and then in the end, he revealed a look of shock. Grandpa Fifteen’s blood energy was too rich. It was truly astonishing!</span></p>

He sensed a wave of yin energy in his grandfather’s body. It was attached to his bones and quite strange.&nbsp;</span></p>

This was a side effect that was brought about by ingesting the Demonic Sovereign’s true blood.</span></p>

Directly devouring it will definitely cause the body to explode.&nbsp;</span></p>

He already died, and the entire Fiend Island was dusky and overcast. This sphere of blood naturally had a bit of deathly energy mixed in.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though it was just a trace, for the inheritor, it was still extremely troublesome. At first, Grandpa Fifteen could still control it, but after being pursued by Heavenly Country’s angel of light, he suffered serious injuries, causing problems to appear. This caused the yin energy to quickly extend towards the bones all over his entire body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In particular, Heavenly Country’s assassins all moved through darkness. They all crawled out from a mountains of corpses and a sea of blood, so their bodies were contaminated by rich amounts of deathly energy and yin mists.&nbsp;</span></p>

They fed on flesh and devoured the soul. When Grandpa Fifteen was hacked like this, that trace of yin energy immediately began to erupt with action.&nbsp;</span></p>

It wasn’t especially profound, but it was too wonderful for words. It merged together with ordinary symbols, turning the rotten into the miraculous. It could be considered a supreme inheritance!</span></p>
