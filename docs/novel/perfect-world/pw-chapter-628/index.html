He had to first look into a few rumors, and then ask others. Then, he intentionally purchased all types of bone books with recordings of Fiend Island to understand it better.</span></p>

A gray-haired elder that was guarding the transport formation spoke. His appearance was thin, and his gaze indistinct. He looked at everyone and carried out this type of warning.</span></p>

If one wanted to head there, they had to draw support from this type of complex and mysterious enormous transport formation.</span></p>

The great formation began to start up, quickly piercing through the void and forming a faint green passage of light that stretched into the distance.&nbsp;</span></p>

They were all creatures heading for Fiend Island. Some of them wanted to go there for exploration, but there were also great powers who were escorting great vicious criminals there.&nbsp;</span></p>

It pierced through the void, connecting to a place several tens of millions li away. These people all entered in an orderly manner, disappearing one after another.</span></p>

They quickly reached their destination. This was traveling through the void, crossing space and traversing a tremendous amount of distance to arrive at one’s destination in the shortest amount of time possible.&nbsp;</span></p>

This individual stood guard here at the designated destination. A guard was stationed here to prevent accidents from happening.</span></p>

If they didn’t do this, not even the great sects would be able to endure the losses.</span></p>

He raised his head and look around. The sky was dusky, and he could feel a bit of pressure. This place didn’t have any sun all year round, always covered by mists.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fiend Island; even though it had the name island, it wasn’t situated in the ocean, nor was it in any normal body of water. It instead floated in the sky, never to fall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You all cannot see it from here. You need to travel through eight hundred li of mists before you are truly inside of the island,” said a boatman. He walked up to solicit customers to ferry them there.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s just eight hundred li, we can just fly there. Why would we need a ferry?” Someone sneered. After speaking, he stepped onto a precious artifact and took to the air, quickly leaving for the distance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, after only travelling several dozens of li, a cry of fear sounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The eight hundred li of mists is extremely terrifying. Normal people cannot travel through it.” Another boatman walked up to get business.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was shocked. This misty region was not normal after all. The few individuals that flew out all returned in a sorry state. They were all badly injured with broken bones and torn muscles. Their injuries were severe.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Being able to return alive isn’t bad. You have to understand that there are many untold dangers inside,” said an elder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a result, everyone dispelled their hesitation and ascended the boats. They chose the safer method of approaching the island.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao did the same. He stood on the boat while carefully observing the surroundings. The mists ahead became more and more dense, and towards the end, it was hard to even see the scenery clearly. If there was no guide, it was extremely easy to get lost.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This boat wasn’t moving through water but instead flying through the sky. It was refined from a very special type of material in Fiend Island. It carried lightning radiance and could travel through the air.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yi</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">, what is that?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, someone cried out in alarm. In the mists a hundred zhang out, there was a pair of lantern like bloody red eyes. It flickered with ice cold radiance and was suffused with dense killing intent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was without a doubt an enormous creature that could fly through the misty region. It stared at everyone on the boat.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Everyone, all of you should feel that this trip was worth it now, right? If you all flew by yourselves, there would have been endless dangers waiting,” said the boatman. He lit a bone lamp on the boat, and then, it really was strange. The pair of dark scarlet eyes closed and the mysterious beast silently backed off, its killing intent disappearing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The boat was travelling quite slowly. It was clearly avoiding a few dangerous areas. This left everyone quite surprised. It was already like this before they even reached the island, so one could imagine how vile the environment within was.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao sat on the boat with his eyes closed. The Ten Thousand Spirit Diagram appeared within his heart. He silently studied it, not wasting time even on this trip. He knew that only by continuously increasing his strength would he be able to roam unhindered through this world, not shackled by anything.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After entering the higher realms, under normal circumstances, he would never use the Kun Peng technique or any precious techniques that were so symbolic, or else he would immediately raise an uproar and have others see through his identity.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ten Thousand Spirit Diagram was something that could change the rotten into something magical. The more Shi Hao understood it, the more peaceful he felt. After reviving, he had always been studying it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We arrived.” A long time later, the boat already stopped. Everyone got off the boat one after another.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was an enormous island. It was like a continent that floated in the void. It covered this area like a great dark cloud, bringing everyone a wave of ancient aura.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We finally arrived.
