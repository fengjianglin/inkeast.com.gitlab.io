It didn’t release the slightest bit of sound, and not a single bit of life could be sensed. There was only a deathly stillness, as well as the mottled marks of time.&nbsp;</span></p>

His body wasn’t that injured, with just his blood and qi stirring about. He sized up his surroundings. There was a mist around the entire enormous ship, making everything hazy and indistinct.&nbsp;</span></p>

How unfortunate was this?&nbsp;</span></p>

Then, golden patterns appeared, glistening and bright as he surveyed the entire great ship.</span></p>

Several hundred li from this place, there was bright red blood on the black-colored ancient ship covering the ship’s planks. They contained ancient and mysterious symbols that could injure the Heavenly Eye.&nbsp;</span></p>

He walked forward, closing in on an expanse of blood. Sure enough, when he walked a hundred li, he ran into it. If he didn’t use the Heavenly Eye, then he would only see a dark red color, able to look directly at it. Once symbols appeared in his eyes, it would instead hurt him.&nbsp;</span></p>

When he tried to transfer power, releasing a streak of bone text from his fingertips, it would bring him incredible pain, as if he was being cut by a blade.&nbsp;</span></p>

It was definitely different from the blood before him. This blood was extremely domineering, hard to even approach.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What terrifying blood!” He really wanted to get some to research, figure out what exactly it was, what kind of symbols it contained, but in the end, he still gave up.&nbsp;</span></p>

He hurriedly used his Heavenly Eye. He had seen many regions with even greater bloodstains, to the extent where there were some that crossed over a hundred li.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why haven’t the strange and ominous events appeared yet?” Shi Hao was suspicious.

What was the use of this ‘water jar’. Where was this ancient boat headed? It was so powerful and intimidating, did it really need to use this jar to ‘get rid of rain’?&nbsp;</span></p>
