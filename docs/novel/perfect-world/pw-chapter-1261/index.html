 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chapter 1261 - Inner Dao</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The great dao of heaven and earth was vast and extensive!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was formless and without substance, no concrete scope, let alone a true body. It was unmatched, too high to reach.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, a streak of powerful fluctuations crushed down, making the world tremble, shaking up Shi Hao’s biological core, his soul even about to collapse. If not for the stone slab below protecting him, he would have definitely been blasted to scattered ashes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He wiped away the blood from the corners of his mouth, gazing into the void. He experienced that vastness, even though he couldn’t see a definite ‘great dao’, there was a great rain of light, and there was that formless loftiness that was enough to leave one terrified.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Grand power, great dao!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao closed his eyes, retracting all of his attention from his research of the fine factors, temporarily stopping his analysis of those granules’ basic composition, instead focusing on the most simple ‘dao’.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This so-called grand power, so-called dao, was something completely abstract. It wasn’t like the divine chains of order, needing to be constructed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If one really was going to try and create it, then it would be the intersection of endless divine chains or order, these chains affecting each other, numerous and close together, producing an invisible domain in this world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, this type of dao, how was one supposed to go and develop it, how were they supposed to interpret this? It was almost impossible to understand, it was full of countless changes!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If one wanted to imitate it, or even directly copy it, it was simply impossible to complete.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The so-called dao comprehension, grasping the dao laws, these were actually all concrete small regulations. There was no way any of them could become the ultimate profound mysteries of the great dao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps it could be said that creatures acquired a corner of the world’s great dao. They obtained fragments, comprehended a piece, not fully grasping it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If one understood all of the great dao, then they would truly transcend above. Not only would they achieve immortality, they would likely soar even above the heavens.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao suspected that not even true immortals necessarily fully comprehended the dao, understanding everything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The so-called heavens’ dao should be referring to the boundless great dao, countless types of great dao, right? If that is so, how will I be able to fully comprehend everything?” Shi Hao said to himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the distance, that beautiful and perfect woman had a head of purple hair, sparkling and shining, brilliant multicolored light flashing past her eyes. She was extremely shocked; this was just a young man, his cultivation realm couldn’t be considered that high, yet he was already about to step foot into this type of domain?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon afterwards, Shi Hao shook his head. He immediately understood something. The so-called heavens’ dao was too definite, this was a type of misconception.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dao, there was only one, just dao. There was no need to divide it into all different types, breaking it down, this was wrong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He understood that higher realm cultivators should all know that the great dao was formless, there was no fixed description. It wasn’t something that could be grasped, aloof and remote.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only, from past until now, when everyone comprehended the dao, they would occasionally remove a small piece of dao law fragment. They would then feel as if they comprehended a type of dao, understanding a type of reasoning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was why the so called partitioning appeared. What three thousand dao, what heavens’ ten thousand dao, what ten great holy dao, they were all defined under these types of situations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All things start from nothing, and then from something back to nothing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dao was formless, without a body. The dao couldn’t be described definitely, it was grand and everywhere, unfathomable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao understood. The so-called three thousand great dao, so-called heavens’ ten thousand dao, they were all laws, couldn’t be called the dao. They were just things that past generations meticulously divided up, a portion of ‘dao’s’ imprints.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps only by piecing all of the laws together could one have a chance at describing the true ‘dao’.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the past, Shi Hao had also talked about the heavens’ ten thousand dao, hoping to rise up above, wishing to fully comprehend it, from this transcend.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Should I also grasp several thousand laws first just like those before me, and then piece them together to produce a vague appearance of the great dao?” Shi Hao said to himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason he entered this seed was precisely to come into contact with the laws of the heavens, and then study them definitively, fully understand them, bring himself close to the true single dao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao reached out his hand, allowing the order, laws, and other things descending from above to wind around his fingertips. His eyes flickered about, staring at them. How was he going to piece together the simple and most primitive single dao?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time went on. One day, two days, three days...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fragments of time scattered, one unable to sense it pass by, flowing alone by itself. Meanwhile, the dao seeker was petrified, not moving, as if he had passed on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many days, perhaps several weeks, perhaps hundreds of days later, only then did Shi Hao revive. For him, it was as if only an instant passed, not really aware of the passed time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He began to piece together all types of laws, wishing to express that grand power, reveal the might of the great dao, but he suddenly discovered that these types of portrayals didn’t do much. He displayed a type of great ‘power’, but it was still a portion of the dao. He had indeed fully comprehended it, but it was still a fragment of the simple and ancient great dao’s imprints, only acquiring a small amount.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We can only explain and name things based on concrete things, things we have experienced, the abstract and things beyond our experience are too difficult to express. None of this can be grasped, everything belonging to the nature of the world, force is useless, one must let things take their own course.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao sighed, feeling a bit helpless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he was just trying to become a powerful individual, then he had long accomplished this, it was already enough. It was because when he comprehended the dao from time to time, continuously capturing the mysterious natural law paths, it would also be a type of dao law in its true meaning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, that really could only be considered law and order, not a reflection of the single dao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He thought about many things, because he knew that researching the three thousand dao, or to be more precise, the three thousand natural laws and other things, was not enough. That was merely the form of the dao those before him were trying to figure out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, how frightening would the enemies be? They were definitely going to be stronger than those predecessors, or else why did they suffer such a great defeat?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Surpassing the heavens’ ten thousand dao, is this that crazy of an idea? Perhaps it is a bit reckless, but I have to at least sound somewhat heroic.” Shi Hao said self-mockingly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He knew that only by rising above all natural laws would one have a chance of fully comprehending the great dao. However, in reality, this didn’t hold that much meaning. More of it was to confront all types of order and natural laws, and not the dao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Dao!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao sat down, his hands holding the stone slab. His eyes were deep, his insides surging; he thought of a few things. He had already searched greatly externally, doing pretty much all he could, so perhaps now, only by starting from within himself would there be any progress.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Dao, formless, without a definitive explanation. All things in this world, a single stalk of grass, a single tree, everything is under dao laws, within the encirclement of dao.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao thought out loud. Then, he examined his own body, treating himself as a world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I am the body, precisely the world. My spirit, my blood, my inner being, are all dao, all of this internalized. All things start from nothing, and then from something back to nothing. Isn’t this contradicting?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was going to make his own body truly stand side by side with the great world!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao felt that he really was a bit reckless. However, only by ‘overestimating his own abilities’, viewing his own body like a great world, being equal to the great cosmos would one dare to make this type of comparison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“My very form and structure is a universe. Even though it is as insignificant as a speck of dust compared to the star domain, my mind is the dao within the body.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao’s black hair scattered about, his eyes burning brilliantly. If one always felt fear, always focused on the heavens’ ten thousand dao, examining the laws of heaven and earth, then it would be difficult for one to feel this type of craziness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He sought the self, temporarily forgetting about everything external.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is the essence of my dao comprehension. I already had these types of thoughts a long time ago, so this is just how I will continue. Guide the heavens’ laws into the body, verify the self with the dao, compare the two, only then will I be able to see and understand the dao of my own body.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What I seek is the dao of self!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He acknowledged that there was a simple and ancient dao that represented the cosmos, but he also knew that there was no way to completely seize that type of grand power, there was no way he could completely portray it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, that meant that he could only truly seek it from within!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All things natural, a speck of dust, a world, and even one’s body, were a universe in itself. It was perfect, completely capable of forming that unmatched unfathomable ‘dao’.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, for the self, it was also the sole dao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The stone slab shook. Shi Hao really did continue like this, the process extremely dangerous, guiding all types of divine chains of order into his body, transforming them, seeking and comparing them with his own body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Natural laws shone resplendently like stellar streams, covering his body densely streak after streak. They were endless, simply about to make him explode.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, the stone slab displayed its effects, protecting Shi Hao the entire time, not allowing him to be destroyed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was because this was within a seed, a heaven and earth placenta. This was a place that received the protection of the world, receiving the doting of heaven and earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, Shi Hao replaced the original host, sitting in this position, so he naturally also enjoyed this treatment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was an unimaginable chance, to observe ten thousand dao laws extend and interweave endlessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As his flesh broke down, all types of divine chains brilliantly transformed. Then, his flesh began to quickly recover under the stone slab’s effects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was extremely frightening, as well as extremely cruel. However, it was incomparably magnificent!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao’s blood flowed, resonating with these natural laws, extending towards the bones of his four limbs. These were dao laws that were spreading, making his body’s muscles and vessels shake, continuously shine. Dao fragments were agitated, resonating here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His bones released&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">keng qiang</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;sounds, the various framework that made up his body’s great dao a part of the main body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His flesh also moved rhythmically, shaking and releasing&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">hua hua</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;sounds like countless leaves. This was the form of dao, making up all of the deficiencies, perfecting him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After who knew how much time had passed, Shi Hao woke up. He was almost burned into charred coke under the endless external laws. It was the stone slab that revived him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The bones, blood, and flesh in my body, are these the inner dao?” Shi Hao’s face was pale.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This looked a bit absurd. If others heard this, they would think that it was extremely laughable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The dao is formless, no set form. It could be anything, yet it could also be nothing.” Shi Hao’s eyes gradually became resplendent, becoming firm and unswerving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Correct, the dao in my body, it can be whatever I want it to be. My form is the universe, everything in the body is the dao.” Shi Hao was completely serious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the distance, that beautiful woman was shocked. She felt like this youngster might have gone mad, starting to wonder if she should provide assistance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I haven’t gone mad! It is precisely this path, seeking the dao within the self! A speck of dust can fill a sea, it can open a great universe! Meanwhile, my body, even though it is insignificant, it can also unveil the dao of the great universe!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Immediately afterwards, Shi Hao became quiet, no longer moving. The laws of the heavens descended, moving around him. He continued to immerse himself in this, comprehend everything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To match the great universe through his own form, the dao within his body correspond with the outer world’s unmatched dao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He first comprehended the components of the divine chains of order, precisely those insignificant granules, and then analyzed the grand great dao. Shi Hao entered the deepest state of nirvana.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, he was like a dead person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After who knew how much time had passed, those regulations, endless law chains that poured down from the sky all wound around his body, forming a web. Then, they continued to weave about, continuing to wind about him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Eventually, when all of the laws were tangled about each other, they formed a cocoon. It was extremely simple and unadorned, without any luster, restricting Shi Hao within.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“With my form as heaven and earth, the inside the foundation for dao.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An extremely quiet voice transmitted from the cocoon, but it made the woman who wasn’t too far out tremble, break into a cold shiver. She felt like something was about to happen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Immediately afterwards, a blast of flames rushed out. It was fist-sized, first turning into a mirror, illuminating endless profound mysteries, and then turned into immortal flames, releasing chaotic light, starting to burn that cocoon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He lost track of time, it was as if a thousand generations passed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That flame burned the cocoon, scripture sounds unending. The ‘silk’ of the cocoon bound Shi Hao’s body tighter and tighter, entering his body, eventually disappearing. Finally, they collapsed and snapped, flying out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the end, that place was scorched black, the cocoon destroyed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Cocoon of dao?” The only observer, that woman, was horrified.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was actually a cocoon of dao, wrapped around one self. He sought the internal dao, seeking a transformation, breaking out, wishing to turn into a butterfly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This woman felt like this young man was a lunatic, absolutely unreasonable, completely mad, actually daring to do this. Was he really going to force out the dao within his flesh?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon afterwards, she sucked in a cold breath of air. She saw the portion of his body that was revealed from that scorched black cocoon. It was without luster, but it wasn’t completely burned into ashes. She felt like this youth might have succeeded!</span></p>
