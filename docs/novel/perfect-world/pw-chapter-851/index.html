You survived and arrived in the higher realms!” Shi Hao stood below the ancient trees as he stared at the person standing on the mountain peak. He released a great sigh.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Previously, he heard on Fiend Island that exceptional talent Li Yuncong was greatly defeated by a dual-pupil user, and back then, he already developed suspicions that it might be this person. Today, everything was confirmed.</span></p>

Sure enough, you tenaciously made it through and reached the higher realms!” Shi Yi sighed softly.&nbsp;</span></p>

His eyes were deep, with great stars changing and chaotic energy hazy within. The scene was astonishing, extraordinary and divine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Yi was extremely handsome, his build tall and sturdy. His temperament was outstanding, and even though he was just casually standing there, one could still tell with a single look that this was a dragon or phoenix among men!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These two spoke up at the same time, and the words they spoke were similar, giving others a strange feeling. Was this some kind of tacit understanding?</span></p>

There was originally an expanse of ancient primitive trees with enormous rocks laying in disarray between them, yet in the end, under a formless type of domain, they silently turned into powder.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was especially the case when a mountain broke apart inch by inch, disappearing before everyone’s eyes!&nbsp;</span></p>

There was a mountain of distance separating the two, yet as soon as they met face-to-face, the auras they naturally exerted produced this frightening result.&nbsp;</span></p>

His former enemy, his cousin from the same clan, had become even more frightening.</span></p>

He couldn’t see any dual-pupils. They might be on the verge of merging!</span></p>

He could tell how she was different from normal people.&nbsp;</span></p>

She had said that when the dual-pupils reached their peak, they would return to being one, but could also produce the dual pupils again. It could be advanced to the limit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And now, Shi Yi had clearly stepped onto this unmatched path!&nbsp;</span></p>

They discovered that something strange was happening, and so all of them hurried over.&nbsp;</span></p>

They felt as if their eyes had entered a mysterious universe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The scene in his eyes was just too terrifying. Stars swirled about one after another, carrying mists, changing within a desolate cosmos to recreate heaven and earth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How shocking of a creature was this, unexpectedly appearing in front of a single person. The more one looked at him, the more they felt like their souls were sinking, developing an urge to bow down and kowtow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pu!&nbsp;</span></p>

Their hearts were incomparably horrified. This person was not someone they should be looking into.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were a few who couldn’t control themselves, standing in place like they were in a stupor. There were some who directly collapsed in the mountain forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What a terrifying individual!” The nearby experts all shivered inwardly, feeling incomparably cold. They no longer dared to casually send out their divine senses, not daring to stare into his eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a wind blew past everyone felt like they were being suffocated. This mountain area was completely changed, an incomparably great pressure now filling this place. It was as if a True Dragon and an ancient Phoenix were confronting each other, about to carry out a decisive battle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You all, back up for now.” Shi Hao said. He warned Lu Yi, Luo Dao and the others not to stand by his side.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little brother, you are still quite strong, strong to the extent of surpassing my expectations. You really are still outstanding.” On the mountain peak, Shi Yi spoke. His battle clothes shone, making his entire body appear sparkling and resplendent. His voice was calm without any resentment or anger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, he seemed to have transcended. He was calm, collected, and confident. His bearing was exceptional.</span></p>

He had never underestimated the dual-pupils, to the extent where it could be said that he attached great importance to him, treating him like a great enemy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he was young, he only had a single enemy, and that was Shi Yi. It could be said that he had also become the only target that he made the firm resolution to surpass.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ever since then, he had never had another target like that.</span></p>

Compared to himself who had lost his supreme being bone and didn’t have anything, he was an insurmountable figure.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Yi had a supreme being bone, and he even had dual-pupils, a matchless youth. His might suppressed all heroes of the eight regions, with no one being his match!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Yi’s strength was evident.&nbsp;</span></p>

He had underestimated Shi Hao, never even having the time to use his own supreme eye technique. There were other reasons as well, but in the end, he still lost.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was precisely after that battle when the Little Stone rose up, his might inspiring awe throughout the world, establishing his unmatched belief. He took his first step onto a glorious undefeated path!</span></p>

A blazing streak of divine radiance erupted in the void, making the space itself seem like it was on the verge of collapse.</span></p>

Waves stirred crazily between heaven and earth, startling all creatures in Fallen Immortal Ridge. All of them were greatly shaken up. They looked towards this direction with expressions of disbelief.&nbsp;</span></p>

He took a step outwards, arriving in the void. He looked at the outstanding male on the opposing mountain peak.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You should call me older cousin.” Shi Yi had a warm smile on his face as he said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Hao’s eyebrows jumped. “Even someone who my older brother has cut down before is deserving of me calling an older cousin?”</span></p>
