 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was because by now, there weren’t that many creatures who could live until a million years old, all those who could top level experts. Even though there was still undying matter in the present world, allowing the prolonging of longevity, it still wasn’t without end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Creatures all died one day, perhaps earlier, perhaps later. If they didn’t achieve immortality, the day would always come when they died of old age.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if one became an unmatched supreme being, reaching the level of Immortal Wang, Meng Tianzheng, and the few others like this, their vitality would still dry up eventually, enter the final stage of their lives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This elder was less than three feet tall, but he was definitely an extremely powerful expert, actually living longer than a million five hundred thousand years!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, the most important thing was that his injury actually didn’t heal after all these years, still there, preventing his severed limb from healing, this even more terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was clear that the one who wounded him possessed matchless divine force. Once an enemy was wounded, then it would be a bit difficult to struggle free from them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was clear that the cultivation of the one who injured the elder was far greater than his, and that was why the injury still couldn’t recover. Even after a million five hundred thousand years passed, it still bled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior, is there no way to heal this injury?” Great Xu Tuo asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ancient monk inheritor.” The elder gave Great Xu Tuo a look, evaluating like this, seeing through him with a single look. One could see how sharp his eyes were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There are some who are too strong, as long as he still lives, his influence will be boundless. It is too difficult for me to heal from this injury myself.” The elder replied calmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone sucked in a breath of cold air. The one who injured him was still in this world, just how strong was he now?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“My master has a way to help me bring it under permanent control, but he advised that it is best if I can live a second life myself, that I will obtain the greatest benefits that way. Unfortunately, this old one is slow-witted, already in my late years, but still unable to experience nirvana and rebirth,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">sigh!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">” he released a light sigh, carrying melancholy and unwillingness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Since I am going to die anyway, without much life left, this injury can just stay the way it is, treat it as a type of glorious scar. It will accompany me in death, after all, it was left by that existence.” The elder said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone became a bit speechless, even a wound could be considered a glorious scar, showed off?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If one thought about it carefully, this was definitely extremely terrifying. One could see just how extraordinary that existence was, even the wound left by an enemy could be treated as glory, truly freakishly strong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Haha,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">this old one doesn’t have the qualifications to be his opponent, just that after just a casual move in the chaotic army, my calf disappeared, even my master feels endless restraining fear towards that existence.” The elder explained further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Towards this, what could everyone say? If even a lord of one of the Nine Heavens’ restricted regions was like this, feeling such misgivings towards a creature, just how strong was he?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Originally, a small lord was going to come from the restricted region, but he just happened to have to face tribulation. A world-shocking great tribulation was about to descend, so it wasn’t good to move. As such, this old one could only come in his place.” The elder said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they heard this, everyone revealed strange expressions, because Huang just finished a great tribulation, one that was truly world-shaking, shocking past and present!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sigh,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">after seeing all of you filled with youthfulness, and then thinking about my young lord, this old one truly is envious. If I could redo my life, reverse time, just how great would that be!” The elder said with a sigh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone revealed strange expressions. This was clearly a guest from a restricted region, yet he didn’t put on any airs, chatting in an easygoing manner with everyone. It really was a bit inconceivable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was because in everyone’s impressions, the restricted regions were all terrifying places that were more frightening than anywhere else. Once one recklessly barged in, it would be difficult for them to live, they would be killed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The elder before them was too amiable, not acting arrogantly at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone invited the elder onto the island, walking towards the ancient palace. Along the way, the elder’s nose moved, becoming extremely shocked, saying, “I can sense the smell of heavenly tribulation, the aura after the calamity.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone immediately revealed strange expressions, telling him that someone just completed crossing tribulation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This lightning tribulation isn’t small, seemingly extremely shocking!” The elder narrowed his eyes, scanning the crowd, wishing to see just who it was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao didn’t say anything, following in the back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior, have you heard of lightning tribulation producing material objects before?” Someone couldn’t help but ask. After all, the elder came from the restricted region, so they wanted to learn about more things from him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I have heard of such things before. Lightning tribulation has unmatched treasures! It will all depend on whether or not you can obtain them.” The elder was all smiles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?!” The youngsters immediately cried out in alarm, all of them greatly shaken.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The creatures who came from the restricted region weren’t ordinary after all, just a random question producing this type of reply. They knew more than the outside world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Could you tell us just what kind of things there are?” Someone asked a step further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“With this old one’s level, it is impossible to step foot into that monstrous domain. Actually, just how many creatures from past until now are able to step foot into that level?” The elder said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He further explained, telling them what he knew. “My lord should know some mysteries, but I never asked before, because I understand myself. Only, I would occasionally hear that when one crosses tribulation, they have been struck by divine stone that immediately turned into liquid. After almost dying in the process, that person lived, and that divine stone was actually an extremely rare material, later refined by him into an unmatched supreme treasure.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This left everyone stupefied, all of them feeling that this was inconceivable. A rock would fall during lightning tribulation, even more dangerous than lightning, smashing straight into a powerful individual, almost killing him? It was too strange!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, when they thought about Shi Hao’s experience, they all felt that Shi Hao was even more strange, able to forcefully seize the Lightning Pool in the great tribulation! There was nothing more absurd than this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone felt like Shi Hao might be the only one of his kind from past until now!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They didn’t continue this topic, because they saw that Shi Hao remained silent, so they didn’t want to expose him. They didn’t know what he was thinking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Seniors, what kind of origins does the restricted region have, what era was it founded in?” A young lady from Wei Family’s Four Phoenixes spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was because she saw that this elder was all smiles, friendly, not feeling any danger. That was why they took this opportunity to consult him for guidance, wishing to understand this great mystery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This old one does not know either, I cannot say.” He shook his head, extremely resolute and decisive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were clearly some things he could talk about, but some things that he couldn’t, this was a type of attitude!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior, since ancient times, the creatures that have accidentally entered the restricted regions have all disappeared, not returning alive, some of them including exceptional individuals, they… are they still in the restricted region?” The master of the Five Spirits War Chariot asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They are dead, body and souls long extinguished.” The elder was still all smiles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, everyone couldn’t help but feel a wave of chilliness. Previously, they definitely had a misconception, mistaking this elder for being friendly, amiable. The creatures from the restricted region were terrifying in the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Previously, when they saw how friendly he was, they even thought that the people who disappeared in the restricted region in the past might still be alive, not killed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now, everyone realized that this was their own wishful thinking!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was smiling, but that didn’t mean that he wasn’t vicious and merciless, that he wouldn’t take action.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">so it was this diagram. It is incredible after all, between the Heavenly Beast Forest, ancient burial region and divine medicine vein, truly extraordinary. There is definitely great natural luck hidden within!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The elder arrived by the table, and then carefully examined the ancient beast skin, speaking like this, continuously nodding and praising.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This made many people’s minds tremble, feel deep shock. It seemed like this elder was quite familiar with the world outside Imperial Pass, not at all unfamiliar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unfortunately, Imperial Pass defended this position, not even a True Phoenix able to cross. The two worlds were severed, so how did he go over? Did he previously leave Desolate Border?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Has senior visited this place before?” Someone asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The elder didn’t say anything, the smile on his face becoming a bit cold, as if he was in deep thought, a bit absent-minded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only after a long time had passed did he say, “</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">, could this be the place master was looking for that year? What a pity, back then, the clues were cut short, unable to find it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These words really were a bit frightening!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The lord of a restricted region above Nine Heavens was looking for this place? This… was extremely shocking. Just what kind of natural luck was there, worth enough for even that level of existence to move out, search for it?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, the other side were also making a big fuss over this, wishing to approach that place!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After studying it for a long time, the elder recovered his cool, smiling again, no longer revealing coldness, becoming amiable again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He looked towards everyone, saying, “The aura left by the lightning tribulation is too rich, it really is astonishing. Just which dao friend crossed tribulation? Really not simple.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this time, Shi Hao couldn’t say anything anymore. This wasn’t the first time the elder asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It is me!” Shi Hao walked out, a harmless smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Heroic youth, possessing war immortal aptitude!” The elder praised continuously. He immediately gave such a great evaluation of Shi Hao, unknown if this was just praise or if it was heartfelt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In reality, Shi Hao still didn’t want to interact with those from the restricted region, because he feared that there might be some changes, and then he would be targeted by them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, now, he had no choice. Since the other party came, moreover asking more than once, if he didn’t step out now, the other party would find out sooner or later.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Instead of this, he would rather come out directly. In addition, he wanted to ask about the Lightning Pool matters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was because the other party wished to learn about he lightning tribulation situation, it couldn’t be hidden even if he wanted to. If he really was trying to hide it, he believed that others would most likely tell on him, for example, Wang Family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two sides both acted politely. The elder directly inquired about the tribulation crossing. He looked amiable, but in reality, he was shocked. This era was far inferior to before, there shouldn’t be any tribulation crossing, yet someone dared face tribulation in the Void Dao Realm, definitely stunning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao spoke things as they were, describing that great tribulation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You… could actually make it through that type of most powerful heavenly tribulation?” The elder’s expression changed for the first time, unable to calm down. He continuously stared at Shi Hao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I wonder if senior can see some things from this item?” Shi Hao didn’t hide anything, bringing out the Lightning Pool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Instead of being eventually exposed by Wang Family and others, becoming friends with the restricted region, he might as well step out himself, be more direct, generously show it, ask for guidance along the way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What is this? Where did you obtain it from?” The elder’s expression was serious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Lightning Pool, something I seized from the heavenly tribulation.” Shi Hao replied with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?!” The elder lost his composure for the first time, somewhat unable to tend to his appearance. His single foot landed on the ground, arriving before Shi Hao with a&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">sou&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">sound, grabbing him with a single move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior, what’s wrong?” Shi Hao asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You… is what you said real?!” His voice was shaking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Of course it is.” Shi Hao nodded. Everyone else also smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You… are a true freak!” What left everyone speechless was that the elder actually gave Shi Hao this type of evaluation, speaking these words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, immediately afterwards, something that made everyone’s jaws drop to the ground happened. He looked at the Lightning Pool while enthusiastically pulling Shi Hao’s arm, saying, “Little brother, from the looks of it, your age isn’t that great, full of heroicness, and also a kind and honest young man.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior, if there is something, please say it.” Shi Hao felt a wave of goosebumps.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s like this, my family’s young miss has not been betrothed yet. She has the countenance of a flower, face like the moon, national grace, divine fragrance. We were just about to select a husband, I think you are quite excellent, perfect to come and live with the family in the restricted region.” The elder said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone became petrified. What was going on? Did they hear incorrectly?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even Shi Hao was dumbstruck, momentarily speechless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The elder held the Lightning Pool, his eyes burning passionately, so shocked he began to shake again. He looked at it again and again, and then back at Shi Hao. “Little brother, what do you think?”</span></p>
