Even though he escaped, there is no place for him to survive in on this Fiend Island. He definitely already died in the depths of the island!” The prison chief was vicious, severely warning these prisoners that hadn’t been locked up for a long time, telling them that if any of them dared to flee, they would be slaughtered immediately.&nbsp;</span></p>

Inside that ancient mine are creatures that have ignited their divine flames. There are several tens of them, all obedient and not daring to play any tricks. It is because they knew that the result of challenging authority is death!”</span></p>

It released auspicious light, clearly containing divine materials. It was one of the most precious great mines, but the curse inside of this place was even stronger. Only extremely powerful individuals could mine there.&nbsp;</span></p>

On top of it hung six or seven corpses, all of them eroded by the harsh weather, but a weak light still burned within them. They were all creatures that ignited their divine flames.</span></p>

They weren’t prisoners, so they naturally wouldn’t receive any punishment. They were just watching this scene of warning.&nbsp;</span></p>

He was extremely worried. This island was dangerous.&nbsp;</span></p>

Some had already been excavated for several tens of thousands of years, but they were still being mined. Large holes could be seen on the ground one after another. They were all numbered.&nbsp;</span></p>

They contained formidable items inside. Unfortunately, these mines were not opened to outsiders and only divine level prisoners were allowed to mine them.&nbsp;</span></p>

There was one other important reason, and it was that this place was too hard to excavate. One needed true experts to go deep inside to obtain anything. It was dangerous and troublesome.&nbsp;</span></p>

There were treasures in the depths of the earth that hid good stuff, and he personally saw someone dig up a great piece of divine material.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a piece of strange crystal that was sparkling and translucent. There was a trace of lightning sealed within, the electric light especially dazzling. It was fixed there and did not rush out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Good stuff! This is divine dao lightning, enough to startle the big figures!” The prison chief exulted. He ordered someone to collect it and carefully seal it inside of a precious case.&nbsp;</span></p>

For experts that cultivated lightning, this type of lightning was a treasure.&nbsp;</span></p>

He looked at that streak of lightning and vaguely discovered some symbols hidden within.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the following half a month, Shi Hao entered the ancient mine and began to participate in the excavation. Only when he truly began did he understand how terrifying this island was.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only when he entered the depths of the earth would one be infected by the curse. After returning to the surface, one needed to spend twice the amount of time cleansing oneself. Meanwhile, the strength of the curse was directly proportional to one’s cultivation.&nbsp;</span></p>

It was extremely sinister, and thunder would rumble.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a terrifying legend that there had been a sect master that fell here.&nbsp;</span></p>

The underground ore was not something those that didn’t reach king level could move. It was extremely difficult even for supreme experts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No wonder they left those powerful convicts with their lives. Only people like them could excavate these ores.&nbsp;</span></p>

They suppressed their power so that they couldn’t retaliate against the jailors and prison chiefs, but they could excavate underground.</span></p>

He obtained quite a bit of information.&nbsp;</span></p>

His eyebrows jumped, and he almost erupted with killing intent.</span></p>

It was a prison chief with a head of gray hair at the supreme expert level. He held a whip that radiated dark light, currently thrashing it at a group of prisoners.</span></p>

His eyes were like those of a snake’s, and his entire body looked harsh. Those prisoners that were a bit slower would receive a lash.</span></p>

After receiving humiliation and torment, he would definite retaliate.&nbsp;</span></p>

There were a few individuals that came to the border of the ancient mine, thrashing their shining whips towards the convicts. Their actions were fierce.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why?” Someone asked without understanding. The outsider miners were quite curious, because after spending just half a month here, it already made them feel extremely bored.&nbsp;</span></p>

This type of rumors easily drew people’s interest.</span></p>

Someone else asked, which was the same as helping him get more information.</span></p>

As a result, he was sent here together with a group of prisoners.” The jailor said softly. He came from another great power that didn’t get along that well with the Qin Clan disciples, so he dared to expose this information.&nbsp;</span></p>

He had heard a long time ago in the lower realm that when his grandfather broke out from the black forest restricted land, apart from bringing out divine magical artifacts, he also obtained a divine pill that was of astonishing value.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The elder brought that rare divine pill excitedly back to Stone Country to have Shi Hao eat it, but in the end, he was completely disappointed.&nbsp;</span></p>

His grandfather lost an arm, so if he ate that divine pill, he definitely could have grown another one, yet he was reluctant to do so, leaving it behind for him the entire time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rumor has it that Qin Chengshang had a formidable grandson, an extremely well known genius in the Qin Clan named Qin Mu. The divine pill was precisely discovered by him.”</span></p>

If his grandson obtained that divine pill, it would have solidified his dao foundation and allowed his cultivation to sharply rise!</span></p>

The Qin Clan wanted to steal someone else’s divine pill, and even treated him like a prisoner and sent him here. Qin Chengshang even carried out this type of revenge, wishing to strangle that single armed person to death. It’s just too excessive!”</span></p>

That single armed man was also decisive, directly devouring it.” The jailer felt that it was quite a pity, but even more so felt an endless jealousy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What kind of thing was it exactly?” Everyone asked.&nbsp;</span></p>

Either way, after he ate it, that single armed man’s entire body shone, and the shackles were directly broken. He erupted with power and almost slapped Qin Chengshang rotten. He then slaughtered his way out.”</span></p>

Then, he was never seen again.&nbsp;</span></p>

A wave of anger burned within his heart, one that jumped about intensely.&nbsp;</span></p>
