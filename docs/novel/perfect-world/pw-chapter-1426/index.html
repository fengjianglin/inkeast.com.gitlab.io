 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Really? You are inviting us to drink a cup of Lightning Tribulation Liquid?” The youngsters felt like their throats were becoming dry, their voices even shaking a bit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lightning Tribulation Liquid, what was this? It was too rare in this world, who could bring out something like this for everyone to share?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Correct, however, there’s too many people here, most likely cannot give everyone a cup. I can only put some into fine wine, let everyone have a taste.” Shi Hao said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was because he saw that even though the ones invited were all the best young experts, the number of people still wasn’t small. There was only a small pool of Lightning Tribulation Liquid too, so if he truly gave everyone a cup, then there wouldn’t be much left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though he went for broke, retaining the entire Lightning Pool, the Lightning Pool this time was too small, only a square foot in size.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they heard a decisive reply, this place erupted with noise, triggering a huge commotion!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was because Lightning Tribulation Liquid was too precious, even if one searched the entire Nine Heavens Ten Earths, not many people drank it before. In this great era, heavenly tribulation no longer appeared. If one forcefully triggered it, the difficulty would increase several times. This would simply be a path of death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the present world, not many people dared to trigger heavenly tribulation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, Lightning Tribulation Liquid was doomed to become one of the rarest things of this world, even the inheritors of the most powerful sects and divine children not tasting it before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was especially the case when they thought about how the tribulation Huang experienced was the most powerful Void Dao Realm heavenly tribulation in all of history, making them feel even more moved. The corresponding Lightning Tribulation Liquid quality was definitely ridiculously good.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I really can’t wait! Really wish to experience just what kind of flavor Lightning Tribulation Liquid has. Invite brother Huang to the seat of honor, hurry, hurry!” A few youngsters who were fond of wine urged, every one of them beaming with joy. It was to the extent where they even forgot about the matters of there being creatures in the Lightning Pool, not immediately surrounding and examining it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were wine-lovers among the elders as well, some not showing anything, truly finding it too embarrassing to fight over alcohol with youngsters. However, there were some elders who were thick skinned and black-hearted, pompous, asking Shi Hao for wine to drink.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Child, I am also quite young, my heart forever remaining at eighteen years of age, still surging with vitality!” This was what an elder with skin just as thick as Shi Hao’s said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Haha…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">” Everyone laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao didn’t touch the sealed Lightning Pool, instead producing a bone cauldron. Previously, he was scared that he might not be able to obtain the Lightning Pool, which was why he used this cauldron to collect a small half of the Lightning Tribulation Liquid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He poured a cup for himself, and then drank it. He immediately revealed a shocked expression, feeling a wave of warmth surging through him. HIs entire body was surging with heat, his blood boiling because of this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This Lightning Tribulation Liquid was too exceptional. Shi Hao was extremely shocked, this exceeded all Lightning Tribulation Liquid he obtained before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This wasn’t only because his cultivation realm increased that the quality of the precious liquid, it was also because the tribulation this time was extraordinary, and that was why it was so different.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Immediately afterwards, everyone saw Shi Hao’s damaged body shine, his injuries that cut into his bone, cracking outer surface, even the bloody hole on his chest started to heal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, his mouth, nose, eyes, ears, all seven apertures were releasing multicolored light, impossible to suppress. The essence light was too brilliant, rushing out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone was stupefied, and then they became happy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Too strong, this Lightning Tribulation Liquid is even more precious than what I imagined, even Huang’s injuries that were that severe were able to instantly heal, this is a rare great medicine after all!’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Things that could be called great medicines were too rare in this world. This was a type of extremely high praise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Shi Hao understood how much essence the Lightning Tribulation Liquid carried, he walked into the place of gathering, entering the ancient palace, personally pouring a bit into every cup, and then filled it with some fine wine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This place immediately flowed with brilliant colors, the entire great palace becoming divine, surrounded in faint essence energy, as well as medicinal liquid and wine fragrances.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Dao brothers, I do not wish to say too much. In the future, we will fight shoulder to shoulder outside Imperial Pass, fight the enemy while drenched in blood. I invite everyone to drink!” Shi Hao said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many people raised their cups, first taking a whiff. They felt extremely reluctant. This was good stuff that could save their lives, drinking it like this was a bit too extravagant, right?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Just drink it, have a taste, this is but the most fundamental vital life power, it will be good even if you drink it first. It will be stored in the flesh, and then when your life force becomes stronger, when you encounter some life-threatening danger, it can help you resolve some distress at the source.” An elder said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heavenly tribulation represented destruction, while this type of liquid was born in destruction, the rarest type of thing, representing new life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Excellent wine, the taste wonderful!” Cao Yusheng was the first to drink it, a rich aftertaste left behind. He naturally wasn’t worried whether or not he would be able to drink it later, instead still waiting to drink more in private with Shi Hao later.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the crowd saw this, they all raised their cups, but after only drinking a single mouthful, just having a taste, they were all shocked. It was because all of their pores shone, as if they ate a stalk of divine medicine, multicolored light surging.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Haha</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">… this is excellent wine. With wine, there naturally must be dishes. I have several dozen half divine fruits here, everyone can have a taste.” Tuogu Yulong said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This old one won’t take advantage of you all, I’ll let you all try some foreign creatures’ dried meat, the taste really is extremely fine!” An elder spoke up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao was moved. He produced a few shining creatures, all of them extremely rare, not belonging to this world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The crowd immediately cried out in alarm, because these were foreign king races, their bloodline strength powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Could this be the ten kings brother Huang killed in Great Scarlet Sky Border?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Correct!” Shi Hao nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone’s eyes burned with desire, even the owner of the Five Spirits War Chariot Qi Hong laughed, saying, “Even though I’ve eaten foreign king races before, it was definitely not this much. Today, I can eat my fill!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was the disciple of an immortal dao family in Imperial Pass. The family previously hunted high level king races from the other side, at that time stirring up a great commotion. He also had the fortune of having a taste before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The atmosphere immediately became lively, everyone was happy and excited, because they were going to eat king races from the other side. It made their blood boil, difficult for them to calm down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eat as much meat as you want, drink large bowls of wine, in the future, we will kill enemies on the battlefield!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll also present my treasures. I stole two of the three Octadic Treasure Chickens my grandfather has been secretly raising!” A youngster said while laughing. He came from an ancient family in Imperial Pass.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Stinky brat, you dare?!” Who would have known that the elder from his clan was precisely in the crowd, studying the Lightning Pool with a group of elders, his true nature revealed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then I’ll just steal one…” The youngster said quietly, lacking in confidence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Haha...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone roared with laughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This place immediately became relaxed and lively.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon afterwards, someone produced a dao flame, starting to roast the king races’ shining meat. There were some that were golden with oil, some snow-white like jade, all of them releasing special fragrances.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The heavy atmosphere of the previous battle was gone without a trace. Everyone talked cheerfully, joking together. They sat in the palace, pushing cups and exchanging cups, enjoying good food.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao released a light sigh. It was unknown how much longer this type of light-hearted joyous times in Imperial Pass could continue for. Was it a few months, a few years, or perhaps a hundred years? Outside Imperial Pass, blood would inevitably flow like rivers, corpses piled up like mountains. He didn’t know if there would be people long killed in battle when they gathered again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was clear that when they gathered again in a decade, a large half of them would have already died.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a reality that couldn’t be changed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Little dao friend, this thing really is formidable, defying the heavens. It’ll likely topple all knowledge! In my opinion, we might have to offer it up to the ancestral altar for those great ones to take a look.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a group of elders, some of them not even bothering to drink Lightning Tribulation Liquid, always researching the Lightning Pool. Right now, some of them finally reached a conclusion, their expressions serious when they raised their heads.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After they researched this, they felt a deep sense of shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There seem to be three dragons inside!” Someone said with a trembling voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?” The group of youngsters drank until they were a bit intoxicated, but they were still roused awake. They all trembed, three dragons?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Lightning Pool being made of true ancient rock is already something that topples general knowledge, but there seem to be three young True Dragons inside as well, swimming in the liquid, we… are really stupefied!” An elder said things as they were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They really were a bit dumbstruck, completely stupefied. After carefully observing and seriously analyzing it, they were sure that wisps of draconic might were flowing out. There were three creatures swimming about inside the Lightning Pool’s liquid, appearing and disappearing, leaving everyone shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were exactly the same as True Dragons, no difference at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What are you talking about? True Dragons? Hand it over, let me give them a beating!” The golden little Heavenly Horned Ant spoke while drunk. Its clan always competed against True Dragons, desiring the position of number one clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao watched for a really long time. This Lightning Pool really was special. It wasn’t that big, but when one looked inside, it was as if it was extremely deep, like an abyss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if one opened their Heavenly Eyes, they still couldn’t completely see through it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The bottom of the pool looked like an abyss. One could vaguely see three young dragons chasing each other, swimming about, accompanied by lightning radiance and strong winds, truly shocking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I really am starting to suspect what kind of origins the True Dragon Race have!” An elder said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is your distinguished self really sure that you aren’t mistaken, that those are… three True Dragons?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A youngster asked with a quiet voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If this really was proven to be the case, then it would definitely be world shattering. Three True Dragons appeared at once, this really was terrifying! Huang really was going to shatter the heavens!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was actually this type of heaven-defying thing that happened after he seized this Lightning Pool!</span></p>
