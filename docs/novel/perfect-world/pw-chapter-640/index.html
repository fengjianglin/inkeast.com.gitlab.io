He tightly clenched his fists.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew that the reason why the elder was like this was because he heard about Shi Hao’s death. This left him with huge psychological shock, making his entire person age much more. He was inwardly grieving and mourning.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao’s face was covered in tears. He shouted loudly inwardly, grandpa, I am still alive! We are about to reunite soon!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t act rashly, because there was a creature that ignited a divine flame here. He prepared himself. He was going to unleash a strike and cut down the most powerful expert, ending the disaster ahead.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are quite the fella as well, breaking out several times and escaping. Not simple at all.” An old woman said. A light green flame burned around her. This was a divine flame that ignited after a life form underwent high levels of rebirth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You can die without any regrets. You have a descendant with two immortal bones. In the future, he will definitely dominate the higher realms and shake the three thousand provinces with his power. Only, for the sake of his growth, it is best if you two do not meet. Just peacefully go on your way.” Another elder said. He wore a purple robe, and the flame around him was a hazy purple as well. The divine flame appeared noble and intense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two experts that ignited their divine flames. This was enough to control the situation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ever since I was sent to Fiend Island as a prisoner, I never had the intention of returning to Immortal Mountain. You all are overthinking things.” Grandpa Fifteen said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What if the day comes when you start feeling emotional and want to meet your grandson? This is no good. It’s still better if you go on your way earlier,” said the old woman indifferently. With pity and arrogance, she said, “Even though Qin Clan’s young supreme being does not need your fostering, that is still your blood grandson after all. In the future, even underground, you will still feel proud of his great accomplishments.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rotten bitch, are those even the words of a human anymore?!” Grandpa Fifteen had always been unyielding. Even if he had sand in his eyes, he wouldn’t rub it. He didn’t feel apprehensive even with a divine level figure in front of him and instead loudly berated.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The words ‘rotten bitch’ immediately made her look like a cat that had its tail stepped on. The old woman immediately revealed great displeasure and bewilderment. Once one ignited their divine flame, their identity and status became extremely high. In all these years, no one had dared to treat her rudely or berated her like this before.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The one surnamed Shi, you really don’t know how to appreciate others’ kindness. We were going to leave you with a whole corpse before and let you end yourself, but now, you can forget about such a thing!” The old woman’s face fell.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do not take offense, instead, just eliminate him. It’s just a dead person, not worth getting angry over.” Beside her, the purple-robed elder said. The divine flame around him jumped, shining brilliantly. He had ignited it for many years now, so he was extremely powerful.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You all really are disgraceful.” Grandpa Fifteen recovered from his broken-heartedness and spoke like this. Even though he was trapped, he was still unyielding.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We really are sick of your Stone Clan, sending people up unnecessarily into the higher realms to disturb Qin Hao’s growth. If not for your Shi Ziling’s identity being too special, it would be best if both of you were killed,” said the purple-robed elder.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When these words were spoken, Grandpa Fifteen’s expression changed. Even Shi Hao felt an anger surging within him, the symbols within his body continuously flaring.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You all still wish to harm Ziling?!” Grandpa Fifteen’s hair flew about chaotically. His eyes widened in fury.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He is Qin Hao’s father, so I do not think anyone wants to act rashly, so I do not believe you need to worry about these things. You can go on and be a ghost now,” said the purple-robed elder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had his hands around his back. There was purple radiance surging around his body. He was about to take action. Heaven and earth foundational energy surged. Electromagnetic mists rushed outwards, terrifying to the extreme.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I had been hunted by a Pixiu and trapped in the Black Forest’s forbidden land for more than ten years. After finally breaking out to see my grandson, I never expected that not even this wish could be carried out. This is the greatest regret of my life.” Grandpa Fifteen calmly said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the distance, Shi Hao’s nose felt sour. His grandfather went out to find vicious beast true blood for him, but in the end, he fell to such an extent. What supported his grandfather all this time was the wish to see him too. Even now, while trapped in this predicament, his grandfather still spoke about this regret, feeling grieved that he couldn’t satisfy this desire.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the stream of heat within Shi Hao’s body was surging. He almost couldn’t stop himself from roaring out. He reached his hand outwards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he knew that he had to endure it. There were divine level experts here, so he had to kill them in one strike. Otherwise, not only would he not be able to save his grandfather, he himself would be in danger too.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old woman’s eyes flickered with cold light, dealing another mental blow. “That descendant of yours in the lower realm really was formidable, killing seven deities alone, destroying the plans of a few great sects of the higher realms, truly quite formidable. Unfortunately, he still died, and he had been buried for more than a year already. The higher realms is a place where exceptional talents contend for supremacy and heavenly geniuses rise up, but none of this has anything to do with him anymore. In addition, even if he is alive, so what? There are countless geniuses in these three thousand provinces. Immortal Palace’s young great one, Heavenly Country’s exceptional direct disciple, and your other grandson -- Qin Hao with two bones. There are more than one or two of these individuals. These are the true supreme beings! Even though that grandson of yours was unordinary, even if he entered the higher realms alive, he still wouldn’t be able to stir up any waves.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since you miss him so much, then go to his side already,” said the purple-clothed elder. He raised his hands. Symbols flickered about his palm, and purple energy pervaded the air.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This should be the true body, right?” Someone muttered in a soft voice from the side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We’ll find out after killing it.” The others walked up, blocking all sides to prevent Grandpa Fifteen from escaping.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My Hao’er, just from how he abandoned his supreme being bone in the end and told his younger brother those words, if he is still alive, he will definitely move unhindered through all three thousand provinces!” Grandpa Fifteen said in a low voice. He felt extremely lonely. Then, he fiercely raised his head and surged with war intent. He was never someone who would yield. Even if he wasn’t a match for the enemy, he was still going to fight it out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You can just go die already!” The purple-robed elder’s eyes were cold like purple blade radiance. He seemed extremely terrifying in the great mist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Now is the time!” Shi Hao’s eyes erupted with divine radiance. When the other party revealed killing intent and focused all of his attention on Grandpa Fifteen, he moved!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that instant, lightning erupted. Shi Hao was powerful like a True Dragon, rushing out from the darkness, every inch of his flesh erupting with spiritual essence. Symbols covered his body, and divine force surged like the sea.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, in his right hand was a true deity divine artifact -- demonfall pestle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was polished from a piece of primordial precious bone that was pure white like jade. There were endless symbols engraved within. At this moment, it boosted Shi Hao’s lightning power to a horrifying level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Deafening thunder crashed down, shaking up heaven and earth!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao was just too fast. He activated the lightning while moving, streaking across the heavens like an undying arc of immortal light!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one was able to react in time, not even the old woman or purple-robed elder. At this critical moment, no one expected there to be an assassin hiding in the darkness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lightning radiance tore through the sky. A youth with dishevelled hair emerged, his pupils releasing shocking radiance that pierced through the mist. In his hands was that precious pestle. When he descended, he was like a heavenly deity!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hong!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His entire body was covered in endless dazzling lightning radiance. It was so blinding that they couldn’t open their eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>

He had experienced the great changes of time.&nbsp;</span></p>

He had met his grandson in the lower realm before, and this was not the person in front of him.</span></p>

His eyes immediately widened, and old tears poured out from his tiger-like eyes. He asked with a trembling voice, “You are my… Hao’er?”</span></p>

He was incomparably shaken as he stared at Shi Hao.</span></p>

After losing his supreme being bone twice, he can still make it through. What else is there that can stop him?!” Grandpa Fifteen’s tears flew everywhere as he laughed loudly. He trembled as he rubbed Shi Hao’s hair and face. His entire body released astonishing radiance, carrying great joy within his sorrow.</span></p>
