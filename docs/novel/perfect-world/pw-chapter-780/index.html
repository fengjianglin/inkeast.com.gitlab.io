Also, why do I have to give you an explanation? If you don’t act respectfully, don’t blame me for being ruthless!” Qi Daolin berated.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shut up. I was stealing from masters back then. Also, are you going to get lost or not?” Qi Daolin spoke, not feeling that it was embarrassing at all, instead saying it in a righteous and self-confident manner.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many people were speechless, shaken up by his domineeringness, but also sighing in admiration. This dao master was too strange.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only a few older generation figures knew the reason. The reason Qi Daolin stole methods from those great sects was mostly out of hatred; that was why he purposely went to steal methods.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qi Daolin had previously been a certain ancient inheritance’s only inheritor. When that sect was jointly attacked by Immortal Palace and others, there were some great sects that threw rocks at them while they were down, and a few powers that they had good relations with treated them like they were already dead, not coming to the rescue.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was why Qi Daolin later on crazily stole from masters to strengthen himself, purposely causing chaos in a few great sects.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Heavenly deity Mo Luo’s face fell ashen, stopping there. This really was humiliating. Dao master Qi didn’t show them any face, acting domineering and cold, putting him in a difficult position.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, he was greatly shocked inside. Back then, Qi Daolin had been surrounded and attacked by all the different sects. Even though his strength wasn’t weaker than an ordinary sect master, his cultivation realm was still a bit lacking.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back then, him and Qi Daolin were both Heavenly deities, but now, Qi Daolin had long surpassed him. Mo Luo felt extremely unwell inside!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mo Luo was quite a bit older than Qi Daolin, but the other party quickly rose up, becoming the lord of a region in the shortest amount of time, leaving him far behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He found it difficult to stay calm inside. That was why he directly called out the other party’s name to make himself look more intimidating.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However now, he was silent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Old ancestor, half of the six heroes have died, and True deities as well as others died. You Yu has been bisected at the waist, his Heaven’s mandate stone in that little monster’s hands!” A deity from Celestial Clan secretly transmitted, expressing his resentment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What?!” Mo Luo was furious. Everything else was still tolerable, but You Yu being cut down, losing the priceless Heaven’s mandate stone was not forgivable.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He stared at Shi Hao, his eyes releasing icy cold radiance. Killing energy pervaded the air, deciding not to waver.</span></p>

Just because I didn’t kill you, you are treating it as if my temper is good?”</span></p>

Everyone was horrified, because they saw golden ripples spreads outwards, rushing towards Mo Luo.</span></p>

They all crushed down on the high and mighty Heavenly deity.&nbsp;</span></p>

The first time was one thing, but this time, he was prepared, and he even had the body protecting secret the Old Celestial bestowed upon him, yet he still couldn’t withstand this power!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under this dao sound’s power, the golden ripples, his entire body flew outwards as if smashed by an enormous hammer. The bones in his body released cracking sounds, and large mouthfuls of blood sprayed outwards.&nbsp;</span></p>

How were they even supposed to fight now? Even their clan’s Heavenly deity couldn’t take a single blow, being blasted flying like this.</span></p>

A golden wave of radiance covered who knew how many tens of thousands of li, quickly arriving. There were two people that released heaven overflowing divine splendor from above.&nbsp;</span></p>

One could very well imagine how they were feeling.&nbsp;</span></p>

He was also a Heavenly deity. In the past, he was at the same cultivation realm as Qi Daolin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you all dare to go to war?” A calm voice sounded from within the mountain gate.

It is one thing for Divine Flame Realm experts to interfere.” Qi Daolin stood there, divine splendor shining gloriously. His voice became cold. “But even Heavenly deities dare to come, truly a joke. However many that comes, however many I will kill!”</span></p>
