 <p><strong>Chapter 141 - To Eat Heartily</strong></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn’t see wrong right? It really is him! The devilish brat from the Void God Realm truly entered the Hundred Shattering Mountains!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Loud clamoring was happening outside, and all of the human race geniuses were in an uproar. No wonder someone offered a bounty, wanting his head; he really did enter this small world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Seeing his victory proves his reputation. What a pity it is for the Feiyi, three eyed geniuses and Rainbow Luan to have met him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Truly no qualms towards fighting, angering humans and deities alike -- devilish brat!”</span></p>
 <p><span style> The </span><span style>people sighed in admiration. When they thought of all the bizarre things that he did, they all felt sorrow and regret. There were many people who wanted to do heaven angering things to him, but in the end, none of them did.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The human geniuses were both amazed and shocked, yet at the same time, they felt rather excited. This rotten child’s savagery was aimed at the powerful races this time, making the human race look more impressive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I truly never thought that there would be a day when I could see the devilish brat’s real body! It feels a bit unreal!” A few young girls were chattering, and their vivid large eyes widened. They really wanted to squeeze their way up to the front.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only, the area around the mountain gate was full of powerful races, so they couldn’t rush through with force.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, there were also people who were resentful. Within the Void God Realm, it was precisely the little guy that they couldn’t stand, and now that they saw him, they hated him even more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If this information was spread out, regardless of whether it is the Ancient Country or the Void God Realm, they would both definitely surge with commotion! This devilish brat is becoming more and more savage, somehow reaching an astonishing cultivation level!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This area erupted into a clamor, to the point where geniuses from other races even knew the history of the devilish brat. They learned of his splendid past, and they couldn’t help but stare with their mouths open; this brat was too weird.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Beside the mountain gate, the clear spring was sweet and cold as it surged with waves. The big red bird added a black pot and sprayed out a divine light. Flames scorched about, heating the water within the pot until it boiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry, it started boiling a long time ago.” It turned around to take a look, and it was excited to the point that it was shaking. Divine snakes like the Feiyi had a deadly enticement towards bird species.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Start it up.” The little guy tossed the strange snake over to it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright!” The big red bird agreed as it cried out with joy. It wiped off its saliva with its feathers, fearing that it might drop down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Feiyi’s entire body was fiery red. It was covered in scales, and was incomparably solid. Rays of scarlet multicolored light were flickering about, and </span><i><span style>dang dang</span></i><span style> sounds ran out whenever it was struck. It was even tougher than that of iron and stone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had a single head, and from below its neck, it was divided into two snake bodies. On top of each body was a wing, and only when they were paired together could it take flight. It had a total of six claws, and they were like Flood Dragon claws. Scarlet-colored scales covered them, and they could easily tear apart iron and stone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It really is hard to prepare. I never ate this type of snake before.” The big red bird was perspiring freely, because this snake’s scarlet scales were too hard. Only after using all of his strength, did it finally peel off a small piece from the area scorched black by electricity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, it borrowed the golden bone shears from the little guy, finally speeding things up. The Feiyi was peeled before being chopped into pieces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Feiyi’s flesh was sparkly and spotlessly white. It was extremely smooth and soft as it flowed with multicolored light. It had not been boiled within the water yet, but it already began to emit waves of sweet scent, making people drool with desire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Haha</span></i><span style>, alright, we’ll slow cook it into snake soup. It will definitely be a delicacy on this earth!” The big red bird swiftly moved the sparkling and translucent snake meat into the pot, slow cooking it in front of everyone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sable also moved close to the front. Its pair of ruby-like eyes were swirling as it muttered inwardly; this youth truly was terrifying. In the future, it definitely had to develop a good relationship with him. Otherwise, what if he was eaten by him?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is still a bit of fine salt here, don’t waste it.” The little guy tossed over a bag of salt, telling it to use sparingly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After dealing with the group of Rain Clan experts within the desert, the little guy went on a search for his previously lost ‘treasures.’ As a result, he once again carried a few seasonings on him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time, he was personally cleaning the chunks of meat from the bird’s thigh and wing by the clear spring. After plucking the radiating divine feathers and washing it clean, he made the big red bird flap its wings, raising a flame.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little guy was extremely patient. He took those two chunks of precious flesh medicine that weighed around ten jin and propped them up. He began to roast the meat seriously, and soon after, the meat fragrance attacked everyone’s nostrils. The shining meat chunks began to shine with a golden tint.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Smells so good!” The little guy wiped off his saliva.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not to mention him, even the throats of the Archaic species who were watching nearby were moving as they began to swallow inwardly. It was because this wasn’t any normal type of flesh, but was rather the precious meat from the Rainbow Luan; how many people had the privilege of eating it?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Strands of multicolored light moved about, and the thigh and wing chunks of meat became a glistening gold. The fat fell into the flames, creating </span><i><span style>chi chi</span></i><span style> sounds, making people drool with desire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was definitely a great tonic medicine. After eating it, it will definitely make one’s essence energy boil. They will gain an inexhaustible power, and their strength will increase by a large amount.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not mentioning the others, the people who were hostile towards the little guy just now were moving their mouths. They were wishing to worm their way into being friends and get a portion of the golden fragrant meat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was only a single creature who was indignant. That was precisely the Luan bird. It was circling about in the sky, continuously crying out. It really wanted to break apart the heavens, and its entire body was flourishing with multicolored light. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop shouting, it’s not like I’m eating all of you. To give my little bro face, we are only eating a small chunk of your thigh and wing.” The little guy shook his head as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Rainbow Luan’s feathers all stood up, and was about to go mad from anger. This savage child was too despicable; he was eating its flesh in front of everyone, yet he was still so tyrannical. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Within the Rainbow Luan’s golden thigh meat was a layer of fat, forming a crisp layer. The fragrance pervaded the air, becoming increasingly attractive. The little guy took out the spoils of war he won -- that scarlet-colored sparkling flying sword polished from fierce teeth, and cleaned it in the water. Then, he heated the blade for a long time before using it like a cooking knife. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He used the sparkling and transparent flying sword to cut open the fresh and crisp golden precious flesh medicine, causing some of the fine salt to scatter down. After that, he opened up a container and began to smear honey on it while roasting it on low fire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Originally, he prepared many condiments and cooking utensils. In the end, he lost all of them while he was being chased down, and could only recover these few items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Wu</span></i><span style>, it smells too good!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was nearly done cooking. The little guy tore off a chunk of the golden flesh, and the honey was sticky as he ate a mouthful. The mouthful of fragrance left his mouth, and it smelled so appetizing that it made others develop saliva in their mouths. Their saliva was about to splash out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little guy closed his eyes. It left a rich aftertaste, and an expression of infatuation covered his entire face. This first bite made him feel as if all of his pores were relaxed, extremely comfortable; it truly was one of this world’s delicacies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It tastes too good!” The little guy once again ripped off a large chunk of meat. The honey was pulled until it became like thread, and as it sparkled, the meat was golden and fragrant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Red, sable, you guys come over and eat too.” The little guy swallowed two jin of meat in a flash. His tongue felt like it was going to melt from the rich aftertaste.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The surrounding group of creatures were incredibly envious. Although this human youth was extremely savage, he really knew how to enjoy himself! In such a intense and dangerous area, he actually acted as if there was no one else here! Seeing him gorge themselves like this made them extremely envious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fragrance in particular was simply too alluring. The geniuses from the other races almost threw themselves over to fight for it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The big red bird was at a loss as he said, “That is bird meat. I don’t feel too good about eating it, so I’ll wait for the snake soup.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You lack experience. This is Luan bird meat, so it’s a different race from you. It is abundant with essence energy, so you will most likely break through after eating it,” said the little guy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The big red bird began to reject it even more, saying, “The Feiyi is also a great supplement, and isn’t inferior to the bird! I’ll wait!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sable drooled. It was not a bird, and directly moved closer. It sustained a severe injury; the vertical eye between its brows was almost clawed out, and it truly needed this type of precious flesh to supplement its health.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, it was extremely powerful itself. Its origin was not ordinary, and was not any bit weaker than the Luan in the sky; it was not scared of its retaliation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With a </span><i><span style>kenchi</span></i><span style> sound, the sable swallowed a chunk of meat, and immediately cried out, saying, “So fragrant! It really is a delicacy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course! Didn’t you see who’s work this was? I am the famous gourmet chef!” The little guy was proud.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two of them ate heartily. Of course, the sable showed proper behavior. It was roughly a zhang in length, and was too embarrassed let loose to gorge itself on the meat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Multicolored light flickered, and the fragrance assailed everyone’s nostrils. The nearby Archaic species were both resentful and inwardly conflicted. They really wanted to go up and ask for a piece, because that smell was too alluring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only the Rainbow Luan was angrily crying in the sky. It really wanted to swoop down and fight to the death; however, it held back this urge, fearing that the little guy might get an extra snack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little bro, you don’t need to hold back. Come over quickly and eat with us,” the little guy called out. He was enjoying the ten jin of bird wing and leg meat, and oil was dripping out of his mouth. Multicolored light sprayed out as he spoke, and his entire body was immersed in the divine rainbow light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The golden lion moved closer with a complicated expression. This sworn brother of his was too savage; how could he be like this? It now felt as if it was the human, and this little brat was the real savage Archaic species.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop staring foolishly. Hurry over and eat!” The little guy once again spoke. </span></p>
 <p><span style>How could the Nine-Headed Lion eat this? If he did, the Luan bird would definitely fight it to the death. However, looking at that golden and glossy precious meat, it really was drooling with desire. It was struggling to hold it in, and with a </span><i><span style>gulu</span></i><span style> sound, it swallowed its own saliva.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Rainbow Luan just happened to fly across. It could clearly see and hear what was going on. It was immediately angered the extreme, loudly shouting, “Nine-Headed Lion, you… You anger me to death!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn’t eat any…” The Nine-Headed Lion felt awkward. This couldn’t be blamed on it! That meat was too fragrant, and if there weren’t any other people on the side and the Luan wasn’t there either, then it definitely wouldn’t be polite.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The snake soup is done!” The big red bird cried out. Divine light flickered about within the black pot, and a pot of snake meat was blossoming with auspicious radiance. The fragrance wafted about, and the soup was sparkling and translucent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little bro, I invite you to eat snake meat.” After eating the last piece of Luan meat, The little guy patted his own little round and bulging belly. He then patted the Nine-Headed Lion as he headed towards the black pot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Other than the snake meat, there were also two snake gallbladders that were left behind. The big red bird naturally didn’t bother to act polite, directly taking one and swallowing it. The little guy took out the other one, and without paying much attention to it, he swallowed it into his belly. This was the best part of the Feiyi, and could not be wasted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little guy’s body immediately began to erupt with scarlet multicolored light. The snake gallbladder’s flourished with might, and it was surging with essence energy. It made his flesh emit thunder-like sounds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good! So powerful!” The little guy was extremely happy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Following that, it called out to the big red bird, sable, and the Nine-Headed Lion to enjoy the Feiyi together. This pot of meat was truly special. The soup was sparkling and translucent, and as divine multicolored light flickered, the snake meat was sparkling with even more precious splendor. There wasn’t a single genius from the other races whose hearts weren’t itching.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Haha…</span></i><span style> Begin the meal!” The big red bird excitedly and loudly shouted. It was the first to dig in, not being polite in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though the little guy ate until his stomach was bulging, his appetite was still great. After refining the precious flesh medicine from before, his body became brilliant, and he began to pig out again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sable did not hold itself back either. Only the Nine-Headed Lion was inwardly conflicted. It really wanted to eat it </span><i><span style>ah</span></i><span style>… However, after glancing up at the sky and seeing the Rainbow Luan angrily crying out there, it truly couldn’t participate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop crying already. We wouldn't have become acquaintances if we didn't fight, so come down and eat with us. Back then, I met little bro like this too,” shouted the little guy towards the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Luan was extremely angry, and naturally wouldn’t compromise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Nine-Headed Lion was embarrassed, and couldn't say much.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A savage child, big red bird, and sable sat around the black pot as they ate to their heart’s content.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was also a Nine-Headed Lion on the side, so conflicted that it wanted to smash its head into a wall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little guy and the others acted as if there was no one else there. They were overjoyed as they ate, completely ignoring the gaze of the powerful creatures around them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a strange scene. All of the creatures who stared were incomparably powerful, yet that human youth didn’t pay any attention to them. He was in high spirits as he ate heartily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The human geniuses had complicated expressions. What was being intrepid? This devilish brat revealed the best interpretation of this. In front of this group of Archaic descendants’ faces, he roasted the meat just like that. After steaming and cooking the Archaic species, he directly gorged himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Truly… of another kind!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The human geniuses all sighed as they spoke. This devilish brat’s way of doing things always made people speechless. After encountering him, many people met great misfortune, angering deities and humans alike! This time, however, his way of doing made the human race appear more impressive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For these types of things, they only appeared every hundred or so years. Never before had they seen such a savage person before, daring to do these types of things.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Countless geniuses as well as experts from various experts were watching these individuals as they ate heartily. After many years had passed from this scene, whenever the people brought up this event, they would still continuously sigh with regret.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, at that time, the savage child’s status and position would be completely different; these stories will all have become rumors and stories.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little guy ate until his belly was as round as a ball. As soon as he opened his mouth, it would inevitably blossom with multicolored light. He absorbed too much precious flesh medicine, and his body was going through a baptism.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a pity that he didn’t open his ninth heavenly passage from this. After all, this was an accomplishment that had only been recorded in ancient books. In reality, it had never been seen before, and the difficulty to reach such a level was beyond one’s imagination!</span></p>
 <p><span style>In reality, it really was like so. It was impossible for the little guy to smash apart the shackles and create a miracle just by eating the Feiyi and Luan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The feast finally ended, and towards these individuals, this was a type of pleasure. However, towards those around them, this was a type of torture. That type of precious flesh medicine and the delicious light it emitted was something they could only see but not eat; it truly made them suffer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little guy picked up the two experts from the three eyed race and carried out some simple first aid. After fixing them up a bit, he began to discuss with the Flame Crow as well as the other Archaic descendants; these were all individuals who were acquainted with the Nine-Headed Lion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since you guys are my little bro’s friends, then you are my friends as well. In the future, when we have problems, we all have to bear through it together.” He burped from being full, and patted his stomach that was as round as a ball while speaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A few of the tyrannical Archaic descendants looked at each other in dismay. Being friends with you is too dangerous… One mistake and we might get eaten. Have you not seen that Luan in the sky and how much it is cursing and bawling?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, how old were you? You aren’t even older than that Nine-Headed Lion, yet you call him your little bro.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now, however, they no longer dared to look down on this human youth. When he spoke, not a single creature dared to be rude. He was treated as if they were on equal grounds, and there was even a type of reverence.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ao...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Right at this moment, the big red bird screamed. The feathers around its body ignited, turning into ashes. It was naked from head to toe, becoming incomparably ugly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Red, what happened?” The little guy was startled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Flame Crow next to the Nine-Headed Lion revealed a envious expression. It began to open its mouth to explain, saying, “The Archaic Feiyi snake is truly beneficial for my bird race after all. It ate one of the snake’s gallbladders, as well as a large part of its body. This is the Flame Bath Rank Advancement!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sure enough, right after its words came out, the big red bird once again cried out with </span><i><span style>ao ao</span></i><span style> sounds. Even though its hairless body was funny, a terrifying aura was being emitted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Following that, the surface of its body emitted light. The nearby rocks and ground began to melt, causing magma to boil.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With a </span><i><span style>honglong</span></i><span style> sound, new feathers were reborn on the big red bird’s body. They were even more beautiful and scarlet, absolutely dazzling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Haha</span></i><span style>… This grandpa broke through, becoming more powerful!” The big red bird shouted with joy. The divine radiance in its eyes rose dramatically, sweeping around in all directions. In the end, it stared at the little guy. “This grandpa is no longer scared of you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little guy scowled and said, “If you keep bickering, I’ll eat you later!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When it heard this, the big red bird immediately withered and completely killed off its temper. Even though it felt that its strength increased sharply, after remembering the scene of the little guy completely refining all of the True Supreme Water, it developed a feeling of powerlessness. It drooped its head, and was incomparably angry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, it raised its head again. It roared towards the surrounding geniuses from the other races, “Don’t irritate this grandpa, or else I’ll eat you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone became dumbstruck. This really was of common origin! Even this bird was infected by this savage child.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sable’s entire body was also radiating with light. The injury was completely gone, and it almost broke through. Its entire body was sparkling and translucent as it flickered with purple light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In a short period of time, there were various powerful Archaic descendants around the little guy, such as the Nine-Headed Lion, Big Red bird, Sable, Flame Crow, three eyed race’s two brothers, and even the angry Rainbow Luan; it was bustling with noise and excitement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop making noise. Sooner or later, we will become friends. Haven’t you seen that the Nine-Headed Lion and I are sworn brothers?” The little guy turned his head towards the Luan bird, and really wanted to talk about how he also ate a part of it before becoming like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, the Nine-Headed Lion’s face immediately turned green. It hurriedly stopped him, not allowing him to say it out loud; otherwise, it would lose too much face. The roasted lion head secret was something that he didn’t want his acquaintances to know about even if it was beaten to death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then you help me console it,” said the little guy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Nine-Headed Lion nodded its head at once. As long as its background was not leaked, anything was fine.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were numerous species here, and they were all extremely powerful. It didn’t matter if they were friends or enemies; as long as the savage child was powerful enough, he could stand inside the group of Archaic descendants and be revered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is it him?” From the distance, someone conversed in a low voice within the crowd.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Correct, it is precisely that devilish brat. In the Void God Realm, he beat a group of experts from my clan until they fled in all directions. In the end, they were suppressed by him and piled up into a human mountain, extorting us!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t make any moves now. Wait until we enter the Historical Remains. We will use all of our strength to kill him then!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The people who spoke were not young, and it was clear that they came in through underhanded means. They restricted their bodies to enter the Hundred Shattering Mountains.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other side, there were a similar group of people. Their gaze were chilly, and cold light flickered. It carried the luster of hatred, and as they muttered, they were also discussing how they were going to deal with the little guy after entering the Historical Remains.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Back then, at the Void God Realm’s starting ground, the little guy was targeted by a few people. Some of them wanted to steal his precious bone, and in the end, he did everything he could to counterattack. He even piled the people from the Four Great Clans into four human mountains, ruthlessly extorting them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This naturally produced a huge complaint. The Four Great Clans all sent people into the Hundred Shattering Mountains, and one of the clans wanted to catch him alive in order to regain that precious scarlet feather fan. That was the treasure of their Zhen Clan, and it was left behind in the Void God Realm, stolen by the devilish brat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Murder and calamity will rise, dark winds and clouds will surge!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why aren’t you guys going into the Historical Remains? I can see divine light rising from time to time, and can tell that it is a precious artifact with a glance. Why aren’t you guys going in to pursue it?” asked the little guy. In his surroundings, there were many Archaic species. He wanted to rope them in with him to enter the Historical Remains.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We sent in a batch of people previously, and they pretty much all died. Those precious artifacts developed intelligence, and will kill those who come close.” The Flame Crow open-heartedly spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sable nodded its heard. It indeed escaped from inside. At that time, it was attacked from behind by someone, and moreover, there were spiritual precious artifacts chasing after it. If it was not for its strength being terrifying enough, then it would have inevitably died.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since we came, we can’t not enter. Let’s go, we will catch precious artifacts!” The little guy did not fear anything as he walked forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This naturally raised an uproar. This was because it had already been a long time since anyone entered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go, we should move out as well!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other side, the Bifang, Golden Divine Bird, Pixiu, Horned Dragon, and others seemed incomparably terrifying; it made people feel as if their hearts were palpitating. These terrifying creatures whose power were difficult to estimate moved out, about to enter the Historical Remains.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone was shocked. Soon after, this area began to clamor with noise. More people wanted to join in and enter the Historical Remains.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Demonic Crack Butterfly, Earth Dragon, Violent Ape, Demonic Cattail Tree and others were already moving. They transformed into strands of light, rushing into the Historical Ruins.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style>“Go, everyone charge in together and suppress those precious artifacts. We cannot go in late and obtain nothing!”</span></p>
