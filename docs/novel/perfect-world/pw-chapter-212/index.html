 <p><strong>Chapter&nbsp;212 - Disrespecting a Deity</strong></p>
 <p><span style>“What stupid deity? If you are so powerful, then break through the rules and order of this place to kill me! I’m going to cut, eat, and eat! Eat everything!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The devilish brat did not feel any fear towards deities, so reverence was even more out of the question. He shouted savagely, his young and tender face carrying a bit of provocation. It was just like when he challenged big yellow in the village when he was younger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was clearly fighting with his life on the line, yet it almost seemed as if there were some immature stubborness in his expression. It truly made people not know whether to laugh or cry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The broken sword in his hand was like a blazing sun as it shone with matchless brilliance. Sword qi gushed out streak after streak, and these fluctuations alone could shave off mountain peaks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the sky, the thick sword streaks of radiance numbered in the hundreds, and they all struck down on the symbol parchment. The Rain of Light there poured down in torrents, creating an ear-splitting sound, as if great stars were being smashed open.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bo</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The earthen-colored symbol parchment emitted light, blossoming like fireworks. The character ‘attack’ became increasingly intimidating, releasing an unwavering aura as it shook incessantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The rain of light became even more magnificent, and a golden waterfall cascaded down from within the parchment’s symbol. It carried within it the will of the Rain Deity, and was not something one could defy since it held within it the laws of a deity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unfortunately, it was still suppressed down to the Heavenly Passage Realm, and so it couldn’t surpass that.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, even though things were as such, it was still terrifying. The golden rain of light was as sharp as blades, and with </span><i><span style>weng long</span></i><span style> sounds, it shook even the heavens. The golden light was concentrated as it struck down on the broken sword with </span><i><span style>dang dang </span></i><span style>sounds.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pu</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Even though the little guy’s defenses were extremely powerful, he was still not able to completely avoid this. His calf was pierced through by a drop of light, immediately causing a string of blood to blossom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stupid paper. You’re about to shatter already, yet you still dare to hurt me.” The devilish brat was angry. The nine volcanoes around his body rumbled, and the magma began to flow like a large river, continuously entering his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rotten paper, hurry up and break!” The little guy shouted, and the ancient black sword began to flowed with strand after strand of multicolored light. It was as if a black phoenix had awakened. Its aura became even more frightening as countless streaks of sword radiance sliced towards the sky.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peng</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The symbol parchment was shaken until it was displaced. After seeing how it was shaken back and forth, one could see just how fierce those attacks were. Even the decree of a divine being couldn’t endure it and seemed like an ordinary boulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little guy pursed his small lips. His expression became increasingly serious as he continuously hacked down. His arms left behind afterimages in the air, because his movements were too fast.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The broken sword violently shook. It had already been brandished countless times, and at this point, the black sword and his arm were resonating together. </span><i><span style>Weng weng sounds </span></i><span style>fell incessantly, turning this area into a sea of swords.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sound and images of the broken sword meshed together. The multicolored light released by the symbols directly turned into an immortal ocean of sword qi that engulfed the skies.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Dang</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The divine decree violently shook. Its brilliance quickly dimmed, and was sent flying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The broken sword in the little guy’s hands did not stop. It continuously slashed about, and within the sword ocean, several streaks of extremely powerful sword qi rushed forth. They were astonishingly thick, and as they smashed over, they seemed to have possessed the force of a mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The divine decree continuously turned about as it flew out several zhang after being struck. In addition, its luster became increasingly dim, and the divine flames curling about it seemed to be on the verge of being extinguished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone became overwhelmed with shock. Just how terrifying was this sword qi? It could actually collide against the symbol parchment of a deity! It was powerful to an unbelievable degree.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Rain Clansmen were even more alarmed. This was too savage! It was merely a single child, yet he actually withstood the Rain Deity’s decree. After all this time, he didn’t fall, and was actually starting his counterattack now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Worship the Rain Deity!” Within the pure land, a group of elders sat down. Upon seeing this scene, the youngsters behind them followed suit. They began to mumble, chanting out an ancient incantation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An wave of mysterious fluctuations proliferated, spreading out like a tide.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Rain Clan’s decree seemed to have recovered, immediately becoming more powerful than before. It was as if it woke up from its slumber, and with a rumbling sound, it turned into a golden sun.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hong</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, lightning flickered, and golden rain erupted with the brilliance of a sun before cascading down. This was the profound mysteriousness of the Rain Deity produced in a fury after its essence energy recovered. </span></p>
 <p><span style> &nbsp;Deities shouldn’t be provoked, and one couldn’t speak profanity against them. If they found out and felt that their prestige was offended, they would immediately erupt into fury!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rotten paper, how come you became stronger again?” The little guy grimaced as two more bloody holes appeared on his body. His body was so powerful, yet it couldn’t defend against the divine rain’s attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He fiercely fought back, but was still struck down from the skies, completely submerged within the rain of light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The devilish brat displayed his precious technique, causing a black body of water to overflow into the heavens. It stopped the sun-like golden rain and resisted the deity’s profound mystery, enduring a tremendous pressure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, he once again fell down to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The devilish brat was unconvinced and did not yield because he knew that as soon as he retreated and tried to flee, he would immediately be killed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He definitely could not retreat now, and had to fight to the end. If he ran, his speed would definitely not be faster than that mystical parchment. It possessed the mark of a deity, giving it power at the absolute limit of this heavenly paradise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Golden rain poured down, carrying with it waves of thunder-like sounds. An endless torrent was descending.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll cut, I’ll cut, I’ll cut with everything I have!” The devilish brat shouted. With a step of his feet, he once again rose high into the air. The Kun Peng wings behind him moved, carrying him forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little guy was without fear as he continuously brandished the sword. The nine heavenly passages around his body shone, gradually fusing with his flesh. The broken sword erupted, creating ocean sized waves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, he activated a precious technique. The Kun Peng and the sword fused together into one body and rushed murderously into the skies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>True Kun Pengs’ bodies were not completely gold. There were also black symbols, and when they soared into the skies, the spreading of their wings would cover the heavens. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Comparably, human bodies were just too weak and weren’t even comparable to dust. It directly devoured that golden sun-like divine decree; the scene was absolutely shocking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The symbol paper transformed, becoming bigger. It released an undying radiance that illuminated the heavens, its aura flourishing even more magnificently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Kun Peng was without fear. After fusing with the sword qi and merging together, it possessed a type of invincible and imposing manner as it oppressed the heaven and earth.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A majestic aura burst forth. The Kun Peng swooped over with symbols numbering in the tens of thousands. The golden parchment was struck and sent flying. It continuously flickered, as if it was about to be blown apart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Kun Peng pursued, wanting to swallow it in one gulp. Its enormous body covered the skies, making all of the spectators dumbstruck; this was simply too shocking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This isn’t a great Peng, but rather the Kun Peng! Truly frightening! He actually revealed this type of precious technique!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With a </span><i><span style>hong</span></i><span style> sound, the little guy dropped down to the ground before once again charging over. He merged together with that Kun Peng, positioning himself at the center. The broken sword flourished with an even greater light as it transformed into a beak that fiercely rushed forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The result was a collision on a world-shaking scale. The rain of light scattered down, and the divine radiance shone in all directions. What happened inside was not visible, because the dazzling light made it so that no one could look straight at it, forcing them to close their eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only much later did this light completely disappear and the skies once again become peaceful. The little guy cried out miserably as he fell down. His body was covered in blood; this time, he received a serious injury.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What about the Rain Deity’s decree? Everyone was confused, because they couldn’t see the earthen colored parchment after the rain of light vanished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, everyone from the Rain Clan couldn’t sit still any longer and was about to go mad. That was a symbol parchment with the will of a deity contained within! How could it vanish just like that?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rotten paper!” After the little guy fell onto the ground, he began to curse in a sulky manner. His body was covered in bloodstains. Taking out a jar of precious blood, he quickly unplugged the cork and began to drink it like water.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Weng</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, a golden symbol parchment flew over from the horizon with an intimidating aura. The earthen yellow became truly golden. It flourished brilliantly and possessed an astonishing divine might.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A crack appeared on it. It was clear that the symbol parchment received serious damage from the great collision just now and was not a match for the Kun Peng and broken sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the will of the deity was unsurpassable. Currently, it was furious, and even though its spirit was fractured, it was still a deity. Being hacked apart apart and sent flying by a mortal was definitely not something its will could tolerate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Still didn’t break?” The little guy was a bit apprehensive. The injuries on his body weren’t light, and could be considered rather serious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The golden-colored symbol paper emitted light. The ‘attack’ symbol on it rang out with </span><i><span style>qiang qiang </span></i><span style>sounds and released an undying aura. In addition, its killing intent overflowed into the heavens.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The rumbling sounds were shocking. It was as if a golden vast body of water surged from above the symbol parchment. This was not a rain anymore but instead a divine ocean that directly cascaded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little guy curse and began to flee frantically. Behind him, the divine wings shook, rapidly increasing his speed to help him evade.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the vast golden body of water were too ferocious and violent. It reached everywhere, hiding the sky and covering the earth as it arrived. He was directly buried, unable to avoid this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Get off me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Kun Peng precious technique rushed forth and a black ocean appeared. No one knew how many li it covered as it surged up violently to withstand the vast golden body of water. Meanwhile, that black great fish also soared up, devouring the divine light..</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Qiang</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The symbol parchment shone in the sky. Every single stroke of the character shook, as if they were precious artifacts. They unexpectedly flew out like strokes of iron and silver with an upright and strong force.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little guy’s expression changed. He took out the broken sword and sent it flying towards the sky to block the ‘attack’ character. The two came together into a huge collision.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within the rumbling sounds of confrontation, the two continued to shake violently as they exchanged attacks. The divine sounds that erupted sounded like the chants of deities, frightening the spectators.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The golden rain poured down in torrents. In addition, lightning and thunder appeared, erupting from the attack symbol. The lightning flowed like streaks of astral rivers as they hacked towards the little guy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thunder and rain interweaved. As a Rain Deity, how could it not know about lightning? They were interdependent, making it even more powerful. At this time, the divine decree completely erupted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little guy grimaced, revealing an expression that was even uglier than crying. Today, he truly suffered, receiving heavy injuries. After such a long time, he still wasn’t able to get rid of the symbol parchment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If people other people knew what he was thinking, they would definitely become stupefied. This was a showdown with the mark of a deity, so being able to last until now was already a world shocking event. However, he was still acting like this, so could it be that he was going to destroy the decree? That was the same thing as directly blaspheming a divine creature!</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the sky, the ‘attack’ symbol shone, and every stroke seemed like a streak of lightning. It rumbled continuously and shown brilliantly in all directions. The little guy that was struck was about to emit black smoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The broken sword blocked withstood it, creating </span><i><span style>kengqiang </span></i><span style>sounds as it continuously shook.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry and wake up. Don't let that stupid paper have it’s way!” The little guy shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He felt as if the broken sword did not fully activate, as if it was still testing him. He still had to depend on himself, making the devilish brat furious. He almost stepped on the broken sword out of anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The battle was incredibly fierce. The symbol parchment shone and surged with a vast golden body of water that met the black waters behind the little guy’s body head on. The huge black fish turned about, creating a heaven shocking wave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, the ‘attack’ symbol from the symbol parchment seemed like a precious artifact, hacking out with lightning. Killing energy descended with a ferocious force to suppress the devilish child.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed as if there was no way out. The little guy was forced into desperate straits. He had no one to rely on, and no route of escape. He could only depend on himself to fight to the end and persevere on.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hou...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The purple Suan Ni erupted. It was as tall as a mountain, towering into the heavens. It wanted to swallow the lightning that was descending, and one of its claws slashed out to shatter the ‘attack’ character.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hong</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The two individuals clashed. They were both lightning in nature, causing an incomparably fierce collision. Endless lightning radiance were emitted, throwing this place into chaos.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The battle reached its climax, and the Rain Clan was uneasy. This devilish brat was too powerful, actually being able to defend against a piece of the damaged decree. It far surpassed their expectations. </span></p>
 <p><span style>They were inwardly anxious, fearing that something bad was going to happen. All of their faces were pale as they watched the battle nervously. They were hoping that the Rain Deity’s will would immediately kill the devilish child. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little guy received serious injurious, and his body was about to break apart. There were over twenty bloody holes, dying his clothes in a bright red; he truly looked rather miserable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had never been in such a desperate state while fighting people. He was about to be killed, because the will accumulated within the divine decree was too powerful. It forced him to be on the defensive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If I had ten heavenly passages, I would directly eat you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He continued to persevere and did not give up. In addition, he began to gradually feel that the symbol parchment’s luster was starting to dim. It was not as rich and powerful as before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stand firm! It’s on the verge of falling as well, so I have to press on!” The devilish brat clenched his teeth. If he was defeated now, then he would truly die without a grave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Yi</span></i><span style>, that symbol degree has become dim!” Right at that moment, the others also began to notice this abnormality.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone from the Rain Clan felt their faces becoming absolutely pale without the slightest bit of color. They were all frightened; how could things have ended like this? Could it be that the Rain Deity’s decree couldn’t suppress him?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, the symbol parchment shone and once again became brilliant. It turned into a huge star as it rushed towards the devilish brat with the intention of killing him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not good! The symbol parchment is burning up it last bit energy, its strength inevitably becoming stronger. He’s going to be killed!” Huo Ling’er was shocked and felt that things were turning bad.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The deity is using his final ultimate move!” The others also sighed, because they felt that it was truly difficult for him to escape this disaster. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The little guy roared. A Kun Peng and a Suan Ni appeared outside his body and began to spin with extreme speed to defend against that symbol parchment. At the same time, the broken sword also flew out to fiercely collide with that decree.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally the broken sword seemed to have awakened . It hacked that symbol parchment in half.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, that symbol character seemed unaffected. It still similarly descended towards the little guy’s chest. The two halves of the symbol parchment continued to shoot down to kill the little guy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rotten paper, I’m not scared of you!” The devilish child shouted.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hong</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The symbol character unleashed its final light, submerging this area. No one could see what was going on clearly and only felt a boundless force spreading out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though he couldn’t protect his life, the little guy still struggled on. Flinging his head, the sparkling small pagoda in his hair collided with that ‘attack’ character. A </span><i><span style>ding</span></i><span style> sound immediately lightly rang out, obstructing it. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Unfortunately, the small pagoda had not yet recovered. The two merely knocked into each other.</span></p>
