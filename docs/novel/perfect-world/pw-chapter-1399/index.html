 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wuwu...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A sea snail bugle horn sounded, making heaven and earth tremble. The foreign great army withdrew like a tide, the black expanse slowly disappearing into the limits of the desert.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On Imperial Pass’ side, there was no one who chased after them. It was because on the other side, there was an elder who held a Heaven and Earth Pouch. This was an immortal weapon, holding up the rear, ready to attack at any time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, a Heaven Swallowing Beast roared. Three lions released low roars, all of them rising up to the air, flying towards Imperial Pass. The cultivators on the Nine Heavens side also began to withdraw under the great knights’ command.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A great battle came to an end just like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Along the way, the warriors from various clans all became extremely quiet. Even though they didn’t suffer greatly this time, even occupying the advantage, everyone still carried worries inside. It was because the other side was too powerful, having undying beings. Once they slaughtered their way over, there would be nothing they could do!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The only thing they could rely on was Heaven Abyss. Once it was broken through, Imperial Pass definitely couldn’t be defended any longer, the Nine Heavens inevitably being buried under.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, the other side’s Anlan and Shutuo, the two unmatched ancient ancestors from the last great era already made some moves, passing down a decree, so in the future, what else would they do?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This type of matchless expert who looked down on great eras one after another, once they really made moves, only heaven knew what was going to happen. Would Heaven Abyss still remain secure?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was hard to imagine what kind of state Imperial Pass and the great earth behind it would be in once Heaven Abyss disappeared!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wuwu…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Suddenly, someone released sobbing sounds, full of sadness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Up ahead, corpses were raised one after another, damaged and in pieces. There were some that were placed on the backs of mounts, others raised in coffins one after another, covered in blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These were all dead cultivators, some of them well-known experts, but there were unknown soldiers as well. After this battle, they all had the same ate, dying outside the pass.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When one turned around and looked back, they would see many corpses. It was an alarming sight, making one couldn’t help but feel aggrieved, releasing long sighs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now that this battle ended, there were many more people who lost their husbands and fathers. After this battle, what filled the eyes was only grief. Weeping sounds gradually became louder, too many scenes of sadness behind, truly hard for others to look at.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, this was just one portion, because more cultivators directly exploded, bones even disappearing, nothing left behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The corpses that could be brought back were only a very small portion!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior, if there is Heaven Abyss stopping them, why must we still leave the pass to fight with them? So many people died, it is just too miserable!” There were people who couldn’t hold back, asking the commanders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If they didn’t leave the pass, these people wouldn’t have died.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were some who believed that with Heaven Abyss in the way, the foreign great army definitely couldn’t cross over, no way they could cross that chasm. Taking the initiative to challenge the other side like this, wasn’t it just having soldiers die for no reason?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The other side is targeting Heaven Abyss, so we must take the initiative to attack, stop their plans!” A middle-aged man spoke loudly. He wasn’t a leader, but he explained this loudly to avoid affecting their morale.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the great knight seated on a golden Pixiu raised his hand, stopping him. He began to explain, speaking up himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Everything is for the sake of training soldiers, to sharpen iron-blooded soldiers!” He said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This simple sentence explained everything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The day might come when Heaven Abyss disappears. At that time, what will happen?” A few elders from different clans added, loudly asking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone became silent. This was what they were the least willing to face, but it was something that could very well happen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sending out soldiers now was precisely for the sake of sharpening the soldiers of various clans, make preparations for the future life and death decisive battle. That might very well be a world exterminating battle, the entire world possibly drenched in blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time, the scale of the battle between the two realms wasn’t small, creatures everywhere in the desert. Both sides suffered great casualties, blood dyeing the sand completely red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, the soldiers who set out from Imperial Pass were still a small portion of their army, not completely going out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When looking at this from a higher perspective, this was only a small scale fierce battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were training soldiers. Without a doubt, if this continued, the soldiers from all different clans would have gone out, experiencing the cruelty of blood and bones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From the past until now, the world outside Imperial Pass has never lacked death, while in this era, there would inevitably be even more!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sounds of weeping decreased, the entire great army becoming quiet, silently walking towards Imperial Pass.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even the powerful vicious beasts no longer roared, returning quietly. A few giant birds cast giant shadows on the ground as they moved forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This type of silence, this type of quietness, made everyone feel a great pressure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It would always be like this every time they left the pass. Large amounts of cultivators withered away, dying, falling in battle outside the pass. This was a type of unavoidable grief and pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The army walked into the primal chaos mist, arriving before the boundless number one pass. Everyone was still quiet, silently entering the city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chi!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A streak of immortal light scattered down, surrounding everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were immediately creatures who cried out miserably, directly turning to ashes, unable to even resist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These were foreign creatures who mixed into their army in this great battle, wishing to infiltrate the pass. However, unfortunately, just like before, they couldn’t enter. After an ancient mirror shone down on them to reveal their true forms, they turned into scattered smoke and ashes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, Shi Hao and the others felt as if they were disintegrating. After entering a strange passage, before they even knew what was going on, they already entered the passage’s depths.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">During this process, he felt his blood rumble, his soul imprint trembling intensely, as if it was resonating with Imperial Pass.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He knew that this was a type of probing, all creatures entering Imperial Pass would be strictly examined. Only those who left this pass not long ago were permitted inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they set off before, they already left their own auras here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Imperial Pass was ancient and mysterious, there were naturally reasons why it was able to stand tall through endless time without collapsing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon afterwards, they entered the city, but in the end, they discovered that there were creatures everywhere. All of them looked in this direction nervously. They were people from different great clans, raising their heads, hoping to see their clansmen return.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was clear that this process would inevitably be full of sadness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao left. There was no one waiting for him here, because Stone Clan was too weak, not having the qualifications to come here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sou!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A golden body rushed down, landing on Shi Hao’s shoulder, returning with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That felt good! I killed many enemies, just that I didn’t encounter any big fish, and an old man always stood behind me, scared that I might get lost, so unlucky!” The Heavenly Horned Ant said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao was speechless. He knew that there were definitely super experts from the city protecting the little Heavenly Horned Ant, fearing that he would die outside the pass before he matured. That type of loss would be too great.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was because a descendant of the Vicious Ten, if nothing unexpected happened, they would definitely rise up to become unmatched beings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">---</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The foreign great army withdrew a step earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Aggressive races were all iron-blooded, even if they died, they would only feel some sadness at that time. They would become calm again soon afterwards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The foreign side was vast and boundless, the regions too vast, who knew how many times greater than the Nine Heavens Ten Earths.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the clans returned, all of them went back to their respective clans’ territory through super transport formations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, there were some who directly gathered together, heading to a meeting. The gathering of the younger generation this time was even more so not a small matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Go invite others, bring over all of my generation’s most powerful geniuses. If we cannot get rid of Huang, then it truly is a type of humiliation. How can my side’s younger generation be inferior to someone from their side?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the great desert war, even Martial Heavenly King was defeated, making many young foreign creatures feel inwardly shaken, also leaving them incredibly worried. They really didn’t want to accept this defeat by a human from the other side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was especially the case after Martial Heavenly King spoke out, saying that Huang already couldn’t be matched in the younger generation. This left many people shocked, all those of this generation paying close attention to this matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Can we head to those legendary ancient lands, invite people from Emperor Clans to come out?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When this sentence was spoken, quite a few geniuses from the younger generation were shocked. Was Huang this terrifying, needing to bother the Emperor Clans?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Be careful, the Emperor Clans haven’t displayed any activity for a long time, not appearing in this world. If someone comes out from the ancient lands, then they would definitely dominate the world, all sides defeated. There won’t be any chance for our generation at all!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Regardless, Shi Hao had already become a well-known person in the foreign side’s younger generation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the great desert battle, he defeated Martial Heavenly King, drawing the eyes of the foreign clans’ young experts. They already saw him as a mountain blocking their path, one that had to be uprooted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Master, you… came back alive!” At Stone Clan’s village entrance, A’Shou saw a figure walk over from the distance. He couldn’t help but cry out loudly in pleasant surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the group of children heard this, they all quickly ran over. They were all shocked and happy to see him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Big bro, you really are formidable! I heard that this time, the battle was extremely bitter, yet you came back safe and sound, not even injured at all! I’m so happy!” A little girl shouted, her rosy little face revealing a pure smile. However, shortly afterwards, she cried, because she lost her father not too long ago, now remembering him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The people from the tribe all appeared. When they saw Shi Hao, they were all extremely happy, revealing simple and honest smiles. There was someone who walked over, giving his shoulder a pat, another who brought over a large bowl of strong alcohol, someone else who brought over a towel for him to wipe away the dirt and sand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It is good that you came back, living is good…” The clan chief Shi Houde’s voice was shaking a bit. What he was scared of the most was when they came back to greet their soldiers, because he would always hear grievous news. The clan’s strong men usually came back dead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Child, hurry and eat some dried meat, recover a bit of stamina.” There were some middle-aged women who walked over, carrying kind and amiable smiles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao thanked them. He felt a type of warmth here, a type of feeling of returning home.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He took up residence here, not having any plans of leaving. He prepared to make this the place he would stay at for some time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the following half month, Shi Hao didn’t go out, guiding the children in their cultivation. In addition, he himself also analyzed his great dao path, entering half seclusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was waiting. When it was time to leave the pass again, his target wouldn’t only be the battlefield!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A few days later, in this area’s mountain range, someone paid this small tribe that rarely received care from others a visit, bringing over a letter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is Huang here? He really is in a remote place, actually in this barren mountain.” The one who came muttered quietly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who are you, what do you need?” The young man A’Shou greeted them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I came to find Huang, deliver an invitation to him. In three days, there will be a gathering in Imperial Pass, those who are invited all the top figures of the younger generation, the elites of all different clans.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What gathering?” With a&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">sou</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;sound, a golden figure rushed over, directly landing by the letter, giving the messenger a fright.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We’ve been busy cultivating recently, where would we find the time to go to a gathering.” The Heavenly Horned Ant curled his lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The gathering this time is quite special, only the leading figures of the present world younger generation going, all of them extraordinary. This meeting will only bring benefits, no harm.” The one who came said. From what he said, the ones who went would all be those who grasped the ebb and flow of the future world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s not like we never met them before in the Nine Heavens!” The little ant was impatient.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This time, not only are the cultivators from the Nine Heavens going, the most powerful inheritors of various clans in Imperial Pass will also be there, even more so descendants of unmatched beings, as well as true immortal posterity. They have never visited the Nine Heavens before.” The one who came explained. It was clear that he really hoped that Shi Hao could go.</span></p>
