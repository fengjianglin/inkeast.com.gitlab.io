 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chapter 1430 - Loosening the Reins to Grasp Even Better</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I think…” The skin on Shi Hao’s face was always like a copper wall, iron bastion. When he was asked this, he didn’t show any shyness, instead about to say the words ‘not a bad idea’. However, soon afterwards, he stopped himself, saying, “What kind of species are you all? Don’t tell me you are…” He looked towards the balding rooster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, this was completely done on purpose. He wanted to take this chance to learn more about the origins of the Nine Heavens’ restricted region, to see what kind of race they were exactly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Haha…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">” The elder was all smiles, extremely kind. He was less than three foot tall, single foot on the ground. He was no longer bold and powerful, entire body suddenly rising into the air, becoming the same height as Shi Hao. He patted his shoulder, and then said, “Young fella, I think highly of you. Once you become my clan’s son-in-law, even if this entire world is destroyed, you will still be safe and sound.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was clear to see that this shriveled elder was experienced. Even when his mind faltered, he could still control the situation, not letting anything leak out, still not giving out any of the restricted region’s secrets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t worry, the lord’s race is the most noble of this world. If you can marry in, even if your aptitude surpasses ten thousand generations, you still won’t feel wronged, instead feel honored.” The elder said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nearby, everyone was extremely shocked, greatly shaken. The restricted region was selecting a spouse. They were going to choose Huang just like this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was especially the case when they heard him say that even if the Nine Heavens Ten Earths are flattened, the restricted region would still exist, not be disturbed, it was clear just how extraordinary they were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he married his way in, it was the same as eliminating future worries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a few people thought about this, they really were moved. However, in the end, they could only sigh. The one the foreign guest chose was Huang, it had nothing to do with them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, they didn’t even have the qualifications to fight over this</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The restricted regions of the Nine Heavens above, what kind of places were those? They were True Dragon pools, tiger dens, one could only enter, could not leave. Who dared face them head-on? They definitely wouldn’t care about ordinary cultivators.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the eyes of the restricted region’s experts, the world’s creatures were like ants, not on the same level at all. There were many rumors that they had existed as far back as Immortal Ancient Great Era.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The master in the middle of this definitely had an identity that was unimaginably great!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were some who suspected that the strength of the creatures inside was world shocking, overlooking the present world. Even the foreign side felt restraining fear, and that was why they could continue existing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Back then, when this world was broken through, the people in distress, almost completely wiped out, only they were far above, unaffected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was to the extent where there were some who suspected that the reason why the foreign great army helplessly withdrew might be because they provoked the restricted regions’ retaliation, and that was why they had to quickly leave this world after their great victory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The elder was extremely frank. He rubbed his hands, and then said. “The only problem is that our young miss really is too extraordinary, and as a result, she is a bit arrogant, normally wouldn’t listen to the clan’s arrangements, not even the master able to do anything. As an old servant, I can only report your situation to the master, the rest depends on how things play out. In the end, the young miss has to make the choice herself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This matter, senior, I have to first confess that in the past, I carried back to the village one, two, three…” Shi Hao counted with his fingers. Those watching became a bit dizzy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What are you counting?” The elder was confused.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wives.” Shi Hao replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The elder’s expression went rigid for the first time. He forced a smile, saying, “What are you trying to say?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“My intention is that I already have many wives, would your restricted region’s young lady be willing to marry me?” Shi Hao said, as if he was quite troubled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they saw his simple and honest appearance, everyone became speechless. Was he really this tactless before the restricted region guest, actually treating the heavenly lady of the restricted region like a concubine?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, those who understood Huang curled their lips. Huang was definitely speaking nonsense. He still hadn’t gotten married, how could he have several wives?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, those who understood the inner details also expressed something, because marrying into the restricted region would most likely mean giving up on everything else. Moreover, he was going to have to live in the restricted region, there were too many issues with this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the restricted region, what kind of freedom was there to talk about? How could one roar through mountains and rivers, do as one pleased? If he had to face the master of that place, he might end up trembling with fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, there were even more people who sighed. Huang really didn’t cherish this opportunity, a great chance was right before his eyes!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cough…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;The elder coughed, revealing a serious expression. “Little brother, please reconsider my proposal, do not be in a hurry to avoid this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He already lived for so long, his eyelashes and eyebrows all empty, so how could he not see through Shi Hao’s attitude? Therefore, he didn’t believe that he was already married.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, his eyebrows jumped, saying, “However, this is fine as well. My family’s young miss is proud and arrogant, if I directly report to the master that you are extraordinary, choosing you as the son-in-law, the young miss might show a bad reaction. How about I only report that you have a great vision, eyesight aimed at the long term, not willing to marry into a restricted region? Who knows, my family’s young miss might instead pay attention to you, come out of anger. At that time, there might be all types of opportunities.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the group of elders heard this, they were all speechless. Didn’t this elder consider too much?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior, how would that work? Helping an outsider fool your family’s young miss, if she finds out, wouldn’t she come to skin you alive?” Shi Hao said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, the elder became vigilant, saying, “</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hm?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Youngster, are you purposely beating around the bush, not agreeing directly because you have these types of thoughts? What was the saying? Grasping even better…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Loosening the reins to grasp even better.” Cao Yusheng helped explain from the side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Right, precisely this.” The elder stared at Shi Hao, looked him up and down continuously, and then said, “Youngster, you really are formidable, actually an expert on this type of matters. I was almost fooled, encountering a capable youngster.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao was speechless. Was this elder purposely mocking him, or did he truly think that he was loosening the reins to grasp the situation even better?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“However, little fella, like this, you really aren’t that sincere! My family’s lord wishes for an obedient, honest son-in-law, even though this might attract the young miss’ attention, my master has discerning eyes, might just slap you to death with a single palm.” The elder said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior, you overthought things, what kind of associations are you making?” Shi Hao rolled his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior, you can have your young miss consider me! Look, chubbiness represents straightforwardness, the most honest and sincere. I’m called Cao Yusheng!” Cao Yusheng’s face was extremely big, laughing brilliantly, directly making his way over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fatty Cao, you are too shameless.” The Heavenly Horned Ant shouted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Lunar Jade Rabbit also agreed, nodding with everything she had.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t want to die! I don’t want to be buried for endless time by someone! When I reappear, where would you all be? With no one left, just the thought alone makes me want to cry…” Fatty Cao said with red eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though he was acting, playing around with the foreign guest, he also revealed a bit of sadness. He really didn’t want to wake up one day to find that after endless time passed, everyone already died, no longer in this world, that he was completely alone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He revered his master greatly, everything he divinated too accurate, able to peer into the future. This always weighed down on his mind like a great mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After several people interrupted, creating a disturbance, the elder finally temporarily dropped the marriage topic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He held the Lightning Pool, staring at it carefully, his eyes brilliant like golden suns, that close to just jumping straight in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Youngster, if you can gift this Lightning Pool to my family’s master, I promise you that he will be extremely happy. When the time comes, there will definitely be tremendous benefits for you.” The elder said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sure, no problem, let me research it a bit, and then after I roast and eat the three creatures inside the pool, I can considerate it.” Shi Hao nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What are you saying? Roasting? I’m going to beat the shit out of you!” The elder glared for the first time, extremely annoyed, moreover actually erupting with killing intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is mine!” Shi Hao naturally took the Lightning Pool back from him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Youngster, I really, really have to advise you not to act recklessly. This pool’s research value is endless. If you really cook them, I fear that you might immediately suffer the wrath of heaven!” The elder said with a suppressed voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What is the deal with it? Tell me a bit, and then I’ll reconsider.” Shi Hao said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“At my level, I do not understand these great mysteries, but my master will definitely know. That is why I advise you to take a trip through the restricted region with it.” The elder said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Isn’t that the same as beating a dog with meat buns? I won’t be able to return after I go!” Shi Hao curled his lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brat, what are you saying?!” The elder glared at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you really not know what this is?” Shi Hao didn’t really believe him. After this elder saw the Lightning Pool, his eyes continuously released light, not wishing to let go.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This thing, I only heard some rumors. However, this came from an unimaginable place, perhaps even those from the restricted region would run out to fight over it. Moreover, if it really is a True Dragon nest, banished into the void, it would trigger huge waves. In short, the value of this thing is unimaginable, possessing tremendous karma!” The elder directly revealed a bit to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, I won’t cook them for now.” Shi Hao said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the elder heard this, his face twitched!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">En?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This thing?” Suddenly, the elder noticed the stone the owner of the Five Spirits War Chariot Qi Hong brought out on the table.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His eyes released golden light, saying, “This palace has some long life aura, turns out it was this thing that contains such rich long life substance? Formidable!”</span></p>
