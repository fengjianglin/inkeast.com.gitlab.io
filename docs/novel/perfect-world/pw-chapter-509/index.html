It was extremely vast. A spectacular sight like this had never appeared before.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within the depths of the scarlet red ocean, there was a precious golden tree that was surrounded by the sun, moon, and stars. At the treetop was an enormous palace. It was a mysterious and astonishing scene.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Definitely have to cross the sea and get there!” A supreme expert muttered. They then joined hands to find a way to cross the ocean. Needless to say, the existence of that tree alone meant that there were tremendous opportunities there.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many people recalled the golden crow clan’s legend. Their race was born from the Sun God Tree.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When a supreme expert had just entered the magma, the magical artifact he was riding on was damaged, having part of it refined by the scarlet liquid. This wasn’t normal magma; its temperature was terrifyingly high.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Follow me!” A silver lion that was bold, powerful, and vicious looking appeared. Its body was brilliant. It produced a bone that did not suffer any damage from this sea of magma, and with two others, they travelled through the sea.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s a divine bone!” Someone said softly. They now knew that ordinary magical artifacts were useless, and that only divine treasures were good enough.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is my golden crow ancestral land. I must ask fellow dao friends to back off!” At this time, two streaks of golden light descended, and two daoists wearing golden feathered cloths emerged to stop those individuals from crossing the ocean.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chi!</span></p>

The temperature was extremely high, and those that proceeded earlier like the silver lion were astonished. They hurriedly put up their defenses.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Dao brothers, this legendary golden tree does not belong exclusively to the golden crow race. It was simply seized by your clan’s supreme being for a period of time.” The nine-headed snake spoke. Its body was enormous, and green scales flickered along its body. It flicked out its snake tongue in an extremely sinister manner.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The seal has been undone, and the Sun God Tree has reappeared. Claiming yourselves to be the new owner, does your golden crow race think yourselves as the ruler of this world?” A Golden Giant spoke in a low and muffled voice. He was extremely tall, as if he was a small mountain. His entire body was golden.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The supreme experts expressed their opinions one after another, adding great pressure to the golden crow race. Even though there were a million flame crow experts in the distance, they didn’t have a high chance of victory when facing against a group of supreme experts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I feel that your golden crow race cannot be so overbearing. You should allow the experts of different races to enter inside and search for their own opportunities.” The ground trembled and continuously cracked apart. An ancient tree moved over.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Its branches and leaves were lush with life. Its roots had long left the earth, and like tentacles and feet, it began to walk on the ground. Its entire body was green, but there were a few leaves that were dyed with the color of blood.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ancient Ironblood Tree!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone became astonished. This was an ancient tree that was quite aggressive. Once it became angered, its leaves would turn a bloody red color and relentlessly attack. This iron blooded creature was cold and callous.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This type of tree was extremely rarely seen. However, as long as they obtained accomplishments in cultivation, they would all become ridiculously powerful, surpassing other cultivators at the same cultivation realm. This was what gave others the greatest headache and fear.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, every single plant system expert had their own original divine ability and precious technique. Normally, no one would provoke them for no reason, let alone an existence like the Ancient Ironblood Tree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We also feel that since the seal has been opened, those that are fated to obtain heavenly divine objects should be allowed to do so.” An ant appeared. It was a zhang in length and flickered with purple golden radiance. This creature was full of power and coldness.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Purple Golden Ant; another powerful supreme expert appeared. It was a mutation of the pure-blooded golden ant. This creature possessed extraordinary strength that couldn’t be matched by any other creature.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nine-headed Snake, Golden Giant, Ancient Ironblood Tree, and Purple Golden Ant were all well-known supreme experts. They enjoyed great reputations in this part of the world. It made the faces of the powerful golden crow race unpleasant to look at.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fine, then we will do it as dao friends say, using your own abilities to find opportunities!” A golden crow daoist spoke. His expression was cold, and after saying this, he didn’t say anything else.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We’ll let you guys have a good look when you get there!” Several golden crows talked among themselves, and all of them continuously laughed coldly. Even though they had lost access to the ancient golden tree, they still knew a bit of inside information.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Large waves of magma rushed into the sky, creating a scarlet red expanse. It sealed up this entire area of the sky; this was the Ancient Ironblood Tree displaying its anger. As soon as it entered the ocean, its roots were scorched black, restraining its movements.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Damn it!” Its words rang out with an ear-splitting volume. A scarlet magical rod was produced. It was as brilliant as blood diamond, and it flowed with divine multicolored light. It made the eyes of everyone who saw it burn with greed; this was the Ironblood Clan’s ancestral artifact.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This magical staff enlarged, becoming like an enormous scarlet tree as it brought it across the sea.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just like that, everyone began to move on their own. They all used their own methods to cross the scarlet sea.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The geniuses and noble ladies from the higher realms arrived eventually as well. When they were all present, they decided to set off as well. They naturally didn’t lack divine objects, bringing out three magical artifacts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We’ll ride in different precious boats and separate into three parties while traveling together. It’s safer this way, and we can watch out for each other as well,” said Bi Gu. His hair was dark green. His figure was tall and big, and his eyes were intelligent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hey, Shi Hao, you can too. Why don’t you come together with us?” Hong Huang spoke. Her fiery red clothes released scarlet multicolored light, as if she was a phoenix lady.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were some that frowned, for example Xuan Ming. They weren’t willing to allow Shi Hao onto the boat.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We already have enough people. If we add in another outsider that we aren’t familiar with, we won’t be able to coordinate properly. He might even become a burden.” Someone said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He is a genius. One who cultivates to his level in the lower realm is considered a rare sight as well. Let him come. Either way, he is just a single person and won’t bring about much trouble.” Lan Yu spoke. She was incredibly beautiful, and her temperament was gentle. A faint blue mist surrounded her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I hope he does not do anything bad and become a burden!” A youth named Zhao Qi frowned and spoke. He seemed a bit disgusted with this idea, not wishing for outsiders to join in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was because the situation this time was too great. The supreme experts didn’t truly understand what laid there, but they knew what what kind of great opportunity rested above the that golden tree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even their group was taking precautions against each other. At the decisive moment, they might even break their peaceful relations and take action against each other, so adding an outsider would only make the situation even more chaotic.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao originally wanted to refuse them, but after thinking for a bit, he still walked over. The geniuses and noble ladies of the higher realms definitely understood some inside information. He might be able to obtain great benefits by traveling with them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There is only so much natural luck. We will fight over them with our own skills!” Xuan Ming said. He swept his eyes over everyone, and when they landed on Shi Hao, a light flashed past them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We will cross the river together for now, and it will require everyone’s cooperation. When we reach the end, we will all display our own methods.” Bi Gu said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I hope the people that get on all prove useful, and we are not wasting our power without a good reason. We didn’t come here to show kindness and randomly accommodate others.” A youth named Zhuo Yun said and gave Shi Hao a look.&nbsp;</span></p>

Last time, there were those who tried to rope him in, but were unsucessful, creating some discontent as a result. Now, they were going to seize some legendary great natural opportunities and were even competing against each other, so they really didn’t feel like they needed to add an outsider into this struggle.&nbsp;</span></p>

Little Stone, come with us. Let’s go to sea!” Hong Huang said. Her eyes flickered with light.&nbsp;</span></p>

He didn’t show any unhappy expressions and walked over. In the end, Lan Yui, Shui Yue, Hong Huang, Shi Hao, and two other geniuses were on the same boat. They headed for the depths of the scarlet sea.&nbsp;</span></p>

It radiated auspicious light that protected everyone inside.&nbsp;</span></p>

There didn’t seem to be any, or else why wouldn’t they hurry over? Or was it to say that they didn’t make any moves yet and were waiting for an opportune time?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hey, Shi Hao, didn’t you go to visit Immortal Mountain as a guest? Why did you come out so quickly?” Hong Huang was covered in scarlet multicolored light that blazed like a flame. She asked loudly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The others were also paying attention They looked in his direction.&nbsp;</span></p>

I decided to leave.” Shi Hao replied.&nbsp;</span></p>

Do you really think that it is that easy for you to come in and out as you please?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the others heard this, they all shook their heads.

This time, you are quite lucky that the fellow from the higher realms didn’t move with us and decided to enter the lower realms with others. Otherwise, if he heard this, he definitely wouldn’t let you go.” Zhuo Yun indifferently swept a look over him.&nbsp;</span></p>

Either way, he couldn’t tell these people that he completely overturned Immortal Mountain, right? Perhaps none of them would even believe him, thinking that he was crazy.</span></p>

After all, these were all things the little pagoda accomplished. He was aware of the extent of his own power, and also knew that these geniuses and noble ladies from the higher realms were extremely powerful.</span></p>

These individuals all had secret treasures. They were also powerful themselves, and as such were all quite self-confident.&nbsp;</span></p>
