He entered the higher realms through the Cloud Race’s transport formation, so he felt that this clan should be too far away.&nbsp;</span></p>

Shadows appeared. A dark cloud swept past. This was a vicious bird with shining feathers. Its eyes were penetrating. When it spread its wings, it stretched over a hundred zhang in length.&nbsp;</span></p>

These youngsters aren’t good enough. They aren’t strong enough and will most likely be completely wiped out.” There were several dozen people on the back of the vicious bird. It was clearly another village who was bringing their youth to participate. This individual started a benevolent jesting.&nbsp;</span></p>

It couldn’t be considered big, but it wasn’t that small either.&nbsp;</span></p>

The branches were upright and strong, and its leaves were verdant and lush. The entire tree was covered in snow white flower petals. This was an ancient tree that was over a hundred zhang tall.&nbsp;</span></p>

A few mounts were lining up to enter the city. Today, the city was bustling with activity. Many tribes’ young experts came.&nbsp;</span></p>

An enormous silver python wrigled over. It was over a hundred zhang in length, carrying a group of people here. They were extremely rude and unreasonable.&nbsp;</span></p>

You are all bullies!” The group of youth were furious. They stood up from the ground and loudly berated.&nbsp;</span></p>

A snail is blocking the road and moving slowly, so we can’t just stay off to the side, right?” The silver large python’s people sneered. They didn’t care about Vermilion Village’s people at all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Quite a few people from Vermilion Village couldn’t hold themselves back. They surged with hot blood, about to rush up to argue with the other party, but they were stopped by third grandfather. He shouted for them not to act rashly.&nbsp;</span></p>

You all can come and give it a try.” A youth on top of the silver great python said with a sneer. He was looking down on all of Vermilion Village’s people.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are too arrogant!” A youngster from Vermilion Village couldn’t help but take action.&nbsp;</span></p>

They are quite strong with a few powerful geniuses. In addition, conflict has broken out between our villages in the past. Do not pay attention to their provocations.” Third grandfather said, fearing that they might suffer losses.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao didn’t take action and just quietly watched. He could suppress the other party, but what about after he left? There might be a disaster that would descend. At the very least, now wasn’t a good time to take action.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“All of you better be careful!” Python Village’s people swaggered off, leaving behind these words.&nbsp;</span></p>

I heard that there are a few vicious people from Python Village that are moving quite close. We are outside, so it is better if we don’t provoke other parties as much and temporarily endure it.” Third grandfather consoled.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nearby, there were people from other tribes.

It was quiet and unmoving. If it wasn’t extremely powerful, it wouldn’t be much different from an ordinary old tree.&nbsp;</span></p>

They were all unique beasts that were powerful and fierce. Their enormous hooves trampled on the ground, releasing heart trembling muffled sounds.</span></p>

They are paying quite some attention to this time’s competition.” The people sighed in admiration.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone took shelter, not daring to stop these people.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fortunately, these Ink Unicorn Beasts slowed down their footsteps and did not barbarically charge into everyone. They were still quite disciplined, surrounding the silver robed young lady as they headed into the city’s main manor.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t look anymore. Hurry and get some rest. The selection competition is going to start tomorrow.” Third grandfather reminded everyone so they could save their strength for tomorrow.&nbsp;</span></p>

They were led into the country town’s enormous fighting arena in the central district. They were going to carry out the competition here.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However,these dozens of mounts appeared again before the selection competition started. In addition, the aged Scholar Tree City master accompanied the silver-robed young lady that came here.&nbsp;</span></p>

This time, you’ve even brought your clans’ most powerful youngsters. I believe that all of you are most sensitive to new information.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone became stupefied. What he said was completely unrelated to the warrior selection competition. Why did he bring this up?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soon after, everyone understood. The old city lord was quite fearful towards those armored horses, wishing to help them obtain information.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is the emissary sent from the prefectural city. Apart from supervising the great selection competitions that are being carried out in various places, there is another important matter…” The old city master explained.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The silver robed young lady walked up, ascending the high platform and overlooking everyone. She was extremely beautiful, but her expression was a bit cold. She slowly unfolded a scroll and displayed it in the void.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Which one of you have seen this person before?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The painting scroll shone, freezing itself in the void. It flowed with a mysterious power. There was a female on the scroll whose physique was tall and slender. Silver hair shone brilliantly. Her pupils were clear. Her entire being was beautiful to a dream-like level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The female in the painting was quite young, looking like she couldn’t be older than eighteen or nineteen. However, she didn’t carry any immaturity or inexperience, instead carrying a type of extraordinary aura.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though her expression was calm and her eyes clear like water, there was a heavy pressure that was exuded from the painting. Everyone felt their heart rates quickening.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was only a painting, yet there was already such a powerful pressure. What if the real person appeared? This was too shocking. This place immediately entered a state of quietness.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Has anyone seen her before?” The silver robed young lady asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“May I ask great one who this young lady is?” Someone said with a small voice. That individual was quite confused. This was clearly a warrior selection competition, so why did this type of situation appear?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Heng!</span></p>

The silver robed young lady swept out a glance, and that individual immediately felt as if he was struck by lightning. He couldn’t stand still and staggered backwards.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone’s expressions changed. This emissary from the prefectural city was so powerful! Just this cold snort alone forced someone back. She was definitely extremely strong. From the looks of it, her age shouldn’t be that great either. This made many of the youngsters feel a sense of failure.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The country town’s old city master coughed and said, “Everyone, do not speak too much. Has anyone seen this silver haired woman? This matter is extremely important.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many people shook their heads, expressing that they did not. They had never met this silver haired woman before. Her temperament looked outstanding. If they ever saw her before, they would definitely not forget.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“She fled into this area. If you all have information about her, hurry and report it. There will be a generous reward!” said the silver robed young lady. She swept her gaze over everyone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone became shocked. They looked at the painting again. The silver haired girl was definitely powerful, with a character that was much more outstanding that the female emissary in front of their eyes and more formidable.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Who was it that injured her? To actually flee to this place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Even if I explained it to you all, none of you would understand!” The silver robed woman coldly snorted. Then, she said quietly to herself, “This was the woman injured by Immortal Palace’s young great one. Only after fighting great battles continuously did he end up seriously injuring her. This person is important. Immortal Palace’s great one has stated that she must be found. It really is hard…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao heard everything clearly. That silver haired girl was actually that young great figure’s opponent? After fighting great battles continuously, she was defeated and suffered severe injuries, fleeing here.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His heart was moved. Even when he was in the lower realm, he already knew how terrifying Immortal Palace was. This woman actually dared to stand against Immortal Palace and carry out a great battle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had heard before that Immortal Mountain’s young great one of this generation was like a great mountain that crushed down on everyone’s minds. Those of the same generation couldn’t be his opponent at all. He was difficult to surpass!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, this woman actually dared to fight intensely against him again and again, ultimately fleeing after being injured, leaving alive. This really was shocking!</span></p>

Will there be a battle too?!” Shi Hao said to himself inwardly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That so-called young great one from Immortal Palace definitely came, entering this region and currently looking for that silver-haired woman. A storm was stirring here.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If there is any information, immediately report it!” The silver-robed girl turned around and left for the distance.</span></p>

Just now, he seemed to have seen a strand of silvery light. It was extremely blurry, flashing not far away. It made his mind jump.</span></p>
