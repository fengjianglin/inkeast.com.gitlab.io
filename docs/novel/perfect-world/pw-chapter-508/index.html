In legends, it even more so possessed an exceptionally high position. It was rumored that the sun in the sky was an ancient slumbering golden crow.</span></p>

However, it wasn’t an ordinary creature either, unexpectedly possessing the aura of a supreme expert. Its entire body was golden, and its feathers released dazzling radiance.&nbsp;</span></p>

He watched it fly into the difference, leaving behind a golden rainbow in the sky.&nbsp;</span></p>

The supreme experts of the eight regions had practically vanished, all of them killed or dead. Apart from the few great sects, it was hard to find existences of this level.&nbsp;</span></p>

Even from such a distance, he could feel the great heat. It was as if an ocean of magma erupted, turning this place completely dry and arid.&nbsp;</span></p>

Then, his scalp felt numb. He immediately turned around and ran, turning into a shadow as he disappeared.&nbsp;</span></p>

There were at least a hundred thousand beasts there, and they were all shining like torches. This pack of creatures was powerful to the extreme.&nbsp;</span></p>

A hundred thousand flame crows wreaking havoc was too horrifying of a scene.&nbsp;</span></p>

Didn’t you see? There was a supreme expert level golden crow moving around. If we can sneak into that place, we might be able to obtain the extraordinary golden crow clan precious technique.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Shi Hao had just left that region, he heard these people talking softly in front of a valley. Those individuals were breathing heavily; it was clear that they had just managed to flee.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He carefully observed from the darkness. Sure enough, it was people he recognized, the geniuses from the higher realms. They appeared to be in somewhat sorry states and had been chased for who knew how many li. Even the edges of their sleeves were scorched.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he didn’t see those noble ladies.

We are powerful enough, and we even brought a secret treasure into the lower realm that can suppress them. We cannot miss the golden crow’s precious land.” Someone spoke.&nbsp;</span></p>

In the distance, fiery light roiled. This group of fiery birds numbered more than a hundred and fifty thousand, burning the skies until even the heavens appeared to be a bit distorted.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao moved away again.

After traveling several hundred li, he saw a city with many people. Creatures with bird heads were entering and exiting this place.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nearby, there were even more volcanoes that roiled with liquid. This place was covered in scorching heat.&nbsp;</span></p>

Even though one would feel scorching heat here, they would also feel their pores relaxing and expanding. There was both pain and happiness.&nbsp;</span></p>

Near this city, there was surging liquid that wasn’t completely magma. There were several that formed springs. They released powerful spiritual essence; it was actually flame liquid!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a type of fire attribute divine liquid that normally existed in magma and was hard to extract. He never expected to see quite a bit here that was collected into a spiritual spring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There weren’t many, but it wasn’t few in number. There were eight in total. Even though it wasn’t top level divine liquid, there was quite a bit. There was a small lake that was almost scarlet red.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao was astonished. He felt a raging flame burning within his chest; this was his supreme being bone sensing powerful divine might. It wanted to devour it and refine it, allowing itself to become more complete and mature.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I can’t! There are more than a million flame crows and golden crows here! If I really go and try to steal that flame liquid, the entire world would come after me.”</span></p>

Those individuals provoked the golden crows, so if he got himself involved, he would definitely be made into a scapegoat.</span></p>

If they appear again and try to look for some ancestral land or something, I’ll come to look for an opportunity again.” He carefully observed this place and found that the flame crows didn’t guard the flame liquid that vigilantly, because there was so much spiritual liquid here.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By the city gate were a few powerful fiery birds. Most of them wore black armor, but a few of them wore golden armor as they patrolled around.&nbsp;</span></p>

King level figures entered and left, and there were even supreme expert fluctuations. They released their divine might that was powerful and astonishing. It was rather intimidating.&nbsp;</span></p>

Not far away, there were many vines twisting about. The place where he was at had divine essence swirling about.&nbsp;</span></p>

There was a pond filled with stone milk. The pure white spiritual essence was astonishing, and it was releasing fragrance.&nbsp;</span></p>

This had definitely been collected for tens of thousands of years, with powerful spiritual essence accumulated.&nbsp;</span></p>

It bathed him in immortal light, making his entire body feel light and comfortable.</span></p>

It was even more majestic than an ocean, and there was no end in sight. It stretched all the way into the ends of the horizon. The heat it gave off was absolutely astonishing.

It was precisely Xuan Ming, someone who tried to invite Shi Hao before but was ultimately refused. He swept an eye towards the distant Shi Hao and said softly, “There is no need. He’s just a lower realm genius. Even if he is extraordinary, he wouldn’t be able to provide much help here. He would only be a burden.”</span></p>

Boundless divine force surged. Within the depths of the Golden Crow Ocean, a majestic scene emerged. An ancient tree reached into the heavens.

There was also a grand palace that was faintly discernible and radiated with unfading radiance.&nbsp;</span></p>
