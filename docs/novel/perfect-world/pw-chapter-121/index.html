 <p><strong>Chapter 121 - Encounter</strong></p>
 <p><span style>Huo Ling’er flipped out, and her head of black hair scattered about. Her crystal like large eyes were opened widely as multicolored light coiled around her body. Her clothes fluttered about, as if they were dancing in the breeze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop! If you have words, then say it nicely.” The little guy quickly retreated after he felt a wave of burning heat. He noticed just now that the ground he previously stood on was thoroughly red, and the stones were about to melt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Fire Nation princess went crazy. Her small cherry mouth was opened, and a flame sprayed out. The entire area immediately surged with lava.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heavens, you can breath fire. You are just like those great Evil Dragons from legends!” The little guys was baffled, once again retreated a bit of distance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are the Evil Dragon!” Huo Ling’er was furious after hearing those words, and her eyes were about to erupt into flames. In front of her body, the flames transformed into a scarlet sparrow. It threw itself over with a surging and blazing heatwave. It was vivid and lifelike, as if a vermilion bird had appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little guy did not retreat any more. A silver disk appeared behind him, roughly the same size of&nbsp;his body. It emitted a clear and cold radiance, enshrouding him and blocking that sky covering flame.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Junior sister, if you have words to say, say them nicely. Don’t throw a tantrum. Archaic Evil Dragons are all like this. If you keep acting like this, you are going to scare everyone away,” said the little guy. He opened up the seventh Heavenly Passage in succession, and so he was currently vigorous with essence energy. Within this group of geniuses in this small world, he could also be considered a type of expert.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Junior sister, forget about it. Junior brother he… He is only being naughty, so there is no need to bicker with him.” The other five geniuses from the Heaven Mending Pavilion rushed over, trying their best to mediate the current situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The multicolored light around Huo Ling’er’s body was restrained. The scarlet flame vanished, restoring her original appearance. She glared at the little guy and said, “Still so young, yet already&nbsp;so naughty. Who knows what will happen when you grow up. If you want my forgiveness, that’s possible. This time, you must go to the Divine Cave, and cannot clash with the Nine-Headed Golden Lion.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fine, on the premise that they don’t provoke me.” The little guy was overjoyed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Divine Cave was located on top of a field. The grass was as tall as a human, and feral wolves were howling. This area was extremely remote, and it was difficult to see signs of human habitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The party entered the grassland. Along the way, they passed by many giant wolves. They were taking precautions as they passed through the rough grass. The setting sun died the sky in scarlet, and the volcanic ash made the prairie seem even more desolate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little junior brother, you actually dare to do such a thing. That is the daughter that the Fire Nation emperor dotes on the most. Typically, even the great nobles would give her quite a bit of face when they see her,” said a senior brother from the Heaven Mending Pavilion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn’t she want to spank my butt? I am only doing to her what she said she would do,” said the little guy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She is merely joking around, it’s not like she actually smacked you,” said a senior sister unhappily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn’t even use all my strength, and only gently patted a bit. It is just like a tickle, and she actually isn’t in pain.” The little guy spoke forcefully and with justice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In front, the Fire Nation princess within the emperor carriage opened her crystal like large eyes, and was about to breathe out fire again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Junior sister, stop scowling. Your senior brother here is not trying to nag you, but there are certain aspects that you should really change about yourself.” The little guy did not take her glare lying down, and directly spoke out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you trying to say?” Huo Ling’er grinded her teeth. Within her bright-colored lips, her white teeth were flickering with sparkling luster.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“First of all, you need to lose weight. Do you see how big your butt is? In addition, it’s so round. After slapping it, it continuously bounced around. This is not good for cultivation.” The little guy seemed to be extremely serious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The prairie immediately became quiet, and soon after, everyone looked at the little guy. They were all stunned, and looked as if they saw a ghost. Was this devilish brat trying to initiate a challenge? To duel with the emperor’s most beloved princess?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Look, I am correct right? Everyone acknowledges, and none of them are refuting, approving my words,” continued the little guy.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ahpu</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Huo Ling’er’s face was thoroughly deep red. A mouthful of blood was almost spat out, and her body flew out of the emperor carriage. Symbols interweaved, and a pair of vermilion bird wings appeared behind her back. Scarlet and translucent, she charged towards the little guy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am going to kill you, you rotten embryo!” Huo Ling’er made threatening gestures with her large eyes and spew&nbsp;out flames. Her slender and wonderful body was like a water snake in the sky, twisting around in inconceivable trajectories.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Ah</span></i><span style>, junior sister, what kind of precious technique is that? To be able to construct wings, teach me, okay?” The little guy seemed to be a good student modestly asking for guidance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rotten embryo!” With a wave of the Fire Nation princess’ hands, scarlet flames were like lightning as they quickly dropped down, enveloping the area below.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little guy made himself scarce and ran, not deciding to fight with her. He charged towards the Divine Cave within the depths of the grasslands. He ran while yelling, “Junior sister, it’s not that I’m scolding you, but your temperament is too awful. Having a big butt is nothing serious, so wouldn’t it be okay as long as you lost some weight? Exercise a bit more, and you will be healthy and beautiful like me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am going to kill you!” Huo Ling’er shouted through her silver teeth. Who dared to take liberties with the precious daughter of the human emperor? Even when they talked to her, they spoke with reverence. Today however, a immature youngster actually repetitively spoke out ‘random words,’ making her so mad that her stomach was in pain.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>On top of the grassland, a great flame burned, engulfing everything in front of her. The rough grass was set aflame, transforming it into a sea of fire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a great chase, and in the end, the little guy decided to fight back. He collided fiercely with Huo Ling’er and fought within the ashes, shocking everyone there into raising their eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the human emperor’s daughter, and was known to be an absolute genius. She was reputed to be a heaven warping divine talent, and was extremely powerful. Now, however, she was actually fighting so intensely with a child, and within this short period of time, it was difficult to see who was going to win.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, the battle began to settle. The little guy was just as lively as before, but Huo Ling’er was gasping for breath. Upon seeing this, everyone was in complete shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A mountain extended outward in front of them, and was incomparably huge and imposing. A mountain like this within this grassland was rather out of place; it was extremely majestic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Halfway up the mountain was a black hole. No one knew how deep it was, and it emitted an indescribably aura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the foot of the mountain, a group of creatures were waiting. They were all extremely powerful as they glared like a tiger watching its&nbsp;prey, revealing an ominous glint in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The few creatures that headed the group in particular were rather extraordinary. They all had distinct appearances, for example, a lion whose body was entirely gold and a silver giant whose body surpassed ten meters. There was even a humanoid creature with a golden horn on his head with two wings on its back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Behind them, they each had a group of followers. There was no lack of human geniuses within them, and currently they had all surrendered, becoming their servants.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You guys finally came, too slow. </span><i><span style>Yi</span></i><span style>, Fire Nation princess, did you just experience a great battle? You seemed to have used up quite a bit of energy, appearing rather exhausted.” The silver giant opened its mouth. Its voice was like a great clock, ringing out with </span><i><span style>honglonglong </span></i><span style>sounds. It shook everything until even the mountain walls were trembling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t say random things, my junior sister is currently losing weight,” replied the little guy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After hearing the two words ‘losing weight’, Huo Ling’er angrily opened her two eyes. It was as if she was irritated to her limit, and almost erupted in anger again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Yi</span></i><span style>, you are…” The golden horned rainbow winged humanoid creature -- Feather King, revealed a surprised expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Nine-Headed Lion even more so turned around its head to look toward&nbsp;this direction. Following that, he looked at a scroll, and after comparing a bit, said, “It’s you… The powerful battle servant I have been looking for.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Its body was actually not that large, but it was completely covered in golden scales. It was as if he was forged out of gold, and the bright and resplendent gold that was emitted was like a mountain as it oppressed everyone. Blood essence was surging, and the sound was like lightning, terrifying everyone to their souls.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time, the Nine-Headed Lion seemed to have received a pleasant surprise and said, “My servant, follow the mighty king. In the future, I will grant you endless glory.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s not necessarily the best way. My silver blood giant race has a similarly unrivaled background. Human youth, follow me and become my servant. In the days to come, you will inevitably shake the great earth, becoming the emperor of a new line of nobles.” The silver giant opened its mouth. Its voice was like lightning, and his body was extremely large. It was like a small mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You two should stop bickering. The humans and our feather race&nbsp;are quite similar in bodily forms. He ought to become my battle pet.” The Feather King opened its mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little guy’s face was extremely ugly. He reached out with his hands, pointing at the Feather King and Silver Giant while saying, “You two move to the side and wait. I won’t eat humanoids, so become my servant.” Following that, he then pointed towards the Nine-Headed Golden Lion and said, “You are the first one to hoot about wanting me as your battle pet. I really don’t know how to forgive you, so come into the pot.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The group of creatures all stared blankly. They stared at the human youth with looks of bewilderment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Feather King laughed and said, “A battle servant needs to be unyielding and have their own temperament. Otherwise, how could they travel throughout the lands.” While speaking, he took action.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Silver Blood Giant did not dare to fall behind, and it also took steps forward. It extended its dustpan like hands to grab towards the little guy with the intention of suppressing and receiving a new servant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The golden lion even more so roared loudly. An expanse of golden light was scattered, and its precious technique was used. He wanted to shake off the other two and subdue the little guy alone. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You guys are making me angry!” The little guy’s face sunk. What did these three creatures think he was was? It was as if he was already their servant a long time ago, and that it didn’t matter how they treated him. Their dialogues did not include him at all, and these three individuals were fighting over him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He directly leaped up, simply and directly sending a fist towards the Silver Blood Giant, colliding with that giant dustpan like palm. The sky rang with a thunder-like sound, and symbols exploded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within the grassland, the rough grass was completely toppled over. It was swept by an unrestrained wave of air. It fell onto the ground, and many giant stones were thrown into the sky in disorder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Silver Blood Giant howled loudly, and its body staggered backwards. Its&nbsp;dustpan-like large palm was dripping with blood. The little guy once again leapt up, sending a kick towards the Feather King.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Feather King flapped its wings, and its rainbow-colored divine feathers launched it into the sky. It was as if a divine arrow shot into the sky, resounding with an ear-splitting noise.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kacha</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The little guy’s entire right leg was emitting light. Golden lightning erupted, sweeping horizontally towards that divine feather. With a </span><i><span style>dingdang</span></i><span style> sound, and then finally with a </span><i><span style>peng</span></i><span style>, he struck the Feather King.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He fell onto the ground, and the Feather King was sent flying by that tremendous force. From the corners of its lips flowed a stream of blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rely on you guys?” The little guy coldly laughed and said, “Becoming my battle pet would make more sense!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With a </span><i><span style>hong</span></i><span style> sound, golden light submerged the heaven and earth. The Nine-Headed Lion pounced over, and it was extremely powerful. He was several times more powerful than the other two creatures. The nine heads hissed and roared, shaking the mountains and rivers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little guy’s heart was startled. This Nine-Headed Lion was terrifying after all. Its symbols were too profound, and it had been cultivating for a long time. Its realm was higher than his, and the strength of its blood vessels were astonishing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had just thrown itself over, yet the ground had already split open. That golden claw was over 300,000 jin in weight, and its killing intent was oppressing. Many of the people there couldn’t stand any longer, and were blown back by the frantic golden aura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sand and rocks flew about on the ground, and rough grass had long turned into fine powder. Millstone sized boulders were like rain, and several thousand jin rocks were like hail. Everything was being engulfed by the golden storm, smashing towards the little guy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Turn back!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little guy approached and moved a murderous weapon. His hand held the mirror created from the Suan Ni’s bone, shining an expanse of symbols. It resisted the great storm, sending it back, rolling towards the Golden Lion’s location.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, he hid within a giant stone. He charged over and arrived, and like a leaf dropping, he descended onto the Golden Lion’s back as light as a feather. He grabbed the hair on its temples and said, “Using you as a mount is not bad, but I really want to eat roasted lion!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hou…</span></i><span style> The Nine-Headed Lion roared loudly, and its entire body emitted light. Dense symbols covered its body, and it shook off the little guy in an instant. The two were not far from each other, and precious techniques erupted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With a </span><i><span style>weng </span></i><span style>sound, the little guy’s Suan Ni bone mirror hack downwards, and the lightning radiance was astonishing. On the other hand, a string of bone beads emerged from within the Nine-Headed Lion’s body, all of those beads sparkling and translucent. It erupted with a brilliant radiance, canceling out this attack.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Shua!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The two individuals swapped positions. The Nine-Headed Lion disappeared from its position, avoiding the little guy’s attack. It shifted into the distance, and its heart coldly shivered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone at the scene carried expressions of stupidity. This human youth was too powerful! It was one human versus three Archaic descendants. He forced two of them back, and fought with the Nine-Headed Lion on equal terms. He did not falter at all; it was too astonishing!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You are extremely powerful. A few days ago, the spirit race’s Mu Feng went to look for you. He left but did not return, so I’m guessing that he died as a result of battle right?” The golden lion opened its mouth. While its eyes opened and close, the golden radiance was like blade aura, oppressing the people to the limit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I ate him,” said the little guy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?!” There were a group of other races here. They were all shocked to the point where their eyes were staring and their mouths were open; their fine hairs were all standing erect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is there to be so surprised about? The reason why I entered the Hundred Shattering Mountains this time is to make a&nbsp;pure blooded&nbsp;Archaic beast youth yield. For example, a Golden Winged Peng’s descendant. As for you guys, don’t provoke me. If you move out of the way for me, then I’ll let it go. However, if you dare to provoke me, you can only come into my pot.” The little guy opened his mouth, revealing a mouthful of snow white small teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Truly savage and too unbridled; this was what all of the other races were thinking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Beat me first before you brag!” The golden lion’s pupils were ice cold. He was currently incomparably awe-inspiring, taking large steps forward. Its claws dropped down, rupturing the great earth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your outward appearance is not bad. Even when you fall, you appear formidable. How about you become my mount for the next few days. I’ll eat eight of your smaller heads, leaving you with the middle one,” spoke the little guy seriously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re looking for death!” The Nine-Headed Lion erupted in fury. Each of the nine heads released a streak of golden radiance. They were like nine swords, all of them were golden. They were extremely gorgeous as they sliced towards the little guy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am doing this for your sake. Growing so many heads, it is definitely a deformity. It is better if those other eight are beheaded, then at least they would be able to become a precious medicine dish.” The little guy dodged the nine flying swords. Endless lightning erupted, drowning out everything in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He began to fight a great battle with the golden lion. While fighting, he said towards Huo Ling’er, “Junior sister, these golden lion heads are precious medicine. In a bit, we will roast it. I will treat you as well as a few others from our school to eat. However, you have to remember after eating to lose weight.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Fire Nation princess was so angry that her dark eyebrows were jumping. She felt as if her mental state was a bit deranged. Could it be that her beautiful buttocks were truly that fat? Otherwise, why did this rotten embryo keep bringing it up?</span></p>
