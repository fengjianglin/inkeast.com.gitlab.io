 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chapter 1239 - The Road Waiting to be Taken</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a broken path, the heroes unable to return. In that brilliant era where exceptional individuals emerged in large numbers, outstanding heroes died on their paths one after another, falling on their own paths.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many people died, those who survived also half crippled, silently departing, their ring of light thus erased from existence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Using the words recorded on the bone books, this path was a broken one, severed by a black abyss. One could vaguely see immortal energy rising up ahead, enticing one to take it. However, heaven warping geniuses set out one after another, yet all of them fell into the abyss, entering that land of eternal damnation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao frowned. This path was too dangerous! Would he even be able to succeed?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In the ancient era, just how many perfect seeds could be found? From past until present, they could be counted. Occasionally, generation dominating talents reached that step, but didn’t have a dao seed to merge with. They weren’t willing to remain mediocre, and thus could only take the broken path.” The Great Elder said with a sigh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao thought silently to himself. He knew how those people felt, all of them just like him right now, unwilling to accept their fate, not willing to be ordinary, wishing to merge with the most powerful ancient seed. They didn’t want to fall behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He wanted to transcend above, wishing to stand at the highest peak of the divine dao. The bumpiness of the path had to be crossed. He couldn’t stop here, he had to continue forward!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It is precisely because they didn’t have the Yin Yang Seed, All Dao Tree and other things that some people decided to take this path. Do you wish to take it?” The Great Elder asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The path was extremely difficult, death waiting at every corner. It was difficult to see hope. This was a choice only those without perfect precious seeds could take. If one didn’t wish to remain ordinary, they had to brave the dangers and press forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I want to take this path!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao finally made his decision, his eyes resolute.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Instead of living as a mediocre person, he would rather ignite his life, let everything go, if he died, then so be it. If he lived, then he would transcend above, able to break through the cocoon and rise up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He knew where the world was headed, only knowing how cruel the future was, and that was why he didn’t fear death, instead wished to produce a true self that transcended above.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, Shi Hao also understood that the Great Elder wouldn’t suggest a path of death to him. He definitely had some confidence, or else he would die for no reason. Why would he even bother keeping him in Heavenly Deity Institution?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Excellent! Since you already set your resolution, daring to take this path, then I also feel reassured. What I feared the most was you being indecisive, worrying about personal gains and losses!” The Great Elder said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Brilliance appeared on his eyes, his eyes carrying praise as he said, “If there is no path, then we will forge one, exceed the ancient people. Otherwise, what qualification do we have to win over the foreign region?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Great Elder spoke candidly, saying that he wouldn’t deliberately harm Shi Hao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The wisdom of the past was accumulated generation after generation, continuing along this broken path. Eventually, many methods appeared in the later stages, verifying this method of using the body as the seed of great dao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Great Elder had previously opened immortal caves, moreover more than one place. The reason why Heavenly Deity Institution was able to reach its current step was precisely because of these resources that had been gathered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was why he grasped quite a few ancient secret texts, some of the jade books recording unimaginable cultivation methods, these methods extremely strange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Great Elder continuously gathered all types of knowledge on using the body as the seed, as well as true experiences, and then consulted with some unmatched experts of the present world, previously obtaining some prospects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was especially the case when he saw the strange seed Shi Hao gathered, making him feel as if the hope of success was strengthened. This was a heaven and earth placenta that could nourish the self, turning it into a dao seed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Take these books and look them over!” The Great Elder said, giving him a pile of jade books, all of them records written in Immortal Ancient language.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao immediately sat down and earnestly studied them. What was recorded weren’t secret methods, only all types of derivations when using the body as a seed, as well as matters that had to be paid close attention to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“These books are only an introduction. When you are truly going to merge with the dao fruit, using the body as the seed, achieving the level of sect master, there are other specialized jade scriptures!” The Great Elder said seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If one wanted to break through the Heavenly Deity Realm, it wasn’t that easy. This was especially the case with Shi Hao who was taking a different path, walking an unusual road, needing to be even more careful. This was going to be a nine deaths one life experience!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“These are for you to look at, they point at the approximate direction. When all of the conditions have been met, you can study the cultivation realm breakthrough scriptures, refine the true self, and thus become a sect master level expert.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao carefully read through them, seriously thinking about everything, roughly understanding the difficulty of this path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he wasn’t scared, to the extent where he was a bit happy. It was because when he cultivated immortal energy back then, he had previously taken the most difficult path, different from everyone else. This time, this would be the foundation, allowing him to undergo a profound transformation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, when he walked to the end of the broken path, there would be nothing else to depend on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Great Elder warned him seriously that when he reached the very front of this broken path, a few strange and frightening things would happen, things that are unimaginable. Every single person’s experiences weren’t that alike.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For example, at the critical juncture, there was one who saw a furnace that suddenly appeared refining all things in heaven and earth; there were some who saw countless feathers drifting about, some people from the past sprouting wings and ascending to immortality; there were others who saw a pair of eyes, as if carrying the boundless heavenly dao, incredibly large, staring at them; there were others who…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was extremely strange, that moment unable to be explained. Many people fell precisely because of this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao used three days of effort to earnestly read through this pile of sacred texts. He closed his eyes and thought for a long time, and then he told the Great Elder that he already understood everything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your body and mind are already ready, but it is always better to prepare against the unexpected. Once you fail, you might very well have your body and dao extinguished!” The Great Elder said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m not scared!” Shi Hao said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rather than being someone mediocre, he would rather just die in the process of becoming great; this was his conviction. He refused to be an ordinary cultivator on the future battlefield, one whose life would be reaped by the enemy like a farm crop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He understood well that the people of the past were defeated, even immortals killed. If he couldn’t transcend above, it would be difficult to change the situation, only repeating the tragedy of the past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">En</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">, still have to make preparations!” The Great Elder said, at the same time also wanting to allow him a smoother breakthrough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What is needed?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“All types of heavenly materials are needed. If you fail, they can preserve your life, and if you succeed, they can help you a step further, speed up the process.” The Great Elder’s expression was serious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The heavenly materials he was talking about were all formidable things, not a single one of them ordinary items, all terrifyingly rare. Shi Hao’s complexion immediately turned green after hearing a few of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those things were too difficult to find, for example, Heavenly Phoenix Blood. Fortunately, the academy still had some. Even though it wasn’t pure, some could be refined.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Back then, Heavenly Deity Institution drew countless geniuses precisely because there was a phoenix blood pool!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sun God Vine, Heavenly Deity Tree, Rebirth Grass, Evil Warding Divine Bamboo…” The Great Elder listed more than ten types of heavenly treasures in a single breath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao’s complexion immediately paled. These things were all divine level, where would he go to look for them? This was just too terrifying, ridiculously extravagant, making his heart jump greatly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Apart from this, there were many other wondrous herbs, ores, and other things, all extremely rare goods.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I have a Soul Guiding Lotus, Heavenly Deity Tree, and Rebirth Grass.” Shi Hao braced himself and listed these things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Great Elder was extremely shocked, Shi Hao was even able to find these things! It really was unexpected, not simple at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These were spoils of war Shi Hao brought out from Immortal Ancient Remains during the battle of three thousand provinces’ geniuses, his greatest harvest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Being able to bring out a few is already not bad. Don’t worry, only a few leaves and branches are needed from the Heavenly Deity Tree, the roots won’t be harmed.” The Great Elder said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In addition, he told Shi Hao that most of the heaven and earth essence has already been prepared. Right now, they only lacked a few types, waiting for him to pick them himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Which ones are missing?” Shi Hao asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Evil Warding Divine Bamboo, needing ancient bamboo that has at least twenty sections.” The Great Elder spoke about this type of divine bamboo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Evil Warding Divine bamboo, this plant was pure white like jade, producing one node every five hundred years, so twenty nodes would be an old bamboo over ten thousand years in age! This was something that was even difficult to find a sprout of, let alone this type of ancient bamboo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yellow Springs Fruit, at least nine thousand years in a place of extreme yin.” The Great Elder listed another plant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This is a legendary fruit. Many people don’t even think it really exists, so you can imagine just how difficult to find it is.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“These are the only two items you need to find yourself. I can help gather everything else.” The Great Elder said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Shi Hao heard this, he took a deep breath. This favor was too great! These were all &nbsp;but divine items between heaven and earth, any one of them enough to make one go crazy. However, in the end, the Great Elder was this generous, helping him settle these issues.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Many thanks to Great Elder.” Shi Hao performed a great act of respect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Evil Warding Divine Bamboo and Yellow Spring Fruit are rumored to both be in the same place. There is no need for you to go to too many places.” The Great Elder said, actually pointing out the place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This left Shi Hao extremely shocked, the Great Elder actually knew where they were. Why didn’t he go and pick it himself, needing him to go? There was likely something else going on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is a different place. When you head there, it can already be considered preparing to break through, taking the first step there, using the wondrous ancient land to refine your flesh, reforge your primordial spirit. Your cultivation will start from there!” The Great Elder’s expression was serious!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Understood!” Shi Hao was moved. This was the case after all, everything began from that place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If these heavenly treasures were gathered, it could help Shi Hao get twice the effect with half the work, as well as add a layer of security on this broken path. Even if he failed, he could still live.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I won’t fail, there is already no way back. I will definitely surpass the ancient people, continue the broken path, step on a new unmatched path!” Shi Hao strengthened his own conviction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It is good that you have confidence!” The Great Elder said. He then looked towards the heavens, his gaze deep. He was a bit absent-minded, recalling the events of his own youth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, the Great Elder sighed, saying, “Do not repeat my tragedy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?” Shi Hao was shocked, his eyes widening to the limit, staring at this elder whose hair was white like snow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The elder also walked this path? He… failed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only, wouldn’t a normal failure die or become crippled? However, the Great Elder still reigned over the world beneath the heavens, becoming a matchless figure few could compare to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This didn’t seem to make sense. The fact that he could reach this step could be considered a miracle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The reason I was able to survive and have my accomplishments today is because of an opportunity. Otherwise, I would be just like those of the past, all of them defeated.” The Great Elder seemed to be a bit disappointed and frustrated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao finally understood why the Great Elder wanted him to walk this path. It was because the Great Elder previously took it himself, deeply understanding this path, having a set amount of confidence. Apart from having the ancient people’s recordings to guide them, he also had his own experiences to pass down!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What a pity that the Dao Harmonizing Flower couldn’t be found. Otherwise, there would be no problems!” The Great Elder sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Dao Harmonizing Flower, what is that?” Shi Hao asked in confusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The number one wondrous flower of heaven and earth. It isn’t a stalk of long life medicine, but it is even more precious!” The Great Elder said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dao Harmonizing Flower, this was a flower prepared by unsurpassed great emperors and immortal daoist level figures, able to allow one to truly become one with the dao, achieve an unmatched dao fruit. There had only been one stalk since the ancient times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao used the body as the seed, so if he could ingest this type of flower, he would definitely succeed without anything unexpected happening!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if he failed, if he found this type of flower, even if he himself had long become half crippled, as long as he had one final breath in him, he could still immediately live, moreover succeed!</span></p>
