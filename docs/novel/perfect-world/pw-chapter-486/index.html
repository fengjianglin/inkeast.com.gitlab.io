 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao was inwardly startled. Was Lan Yu implying that due to the boundless size of the higher realms, there were many great sects, and as such, he shouldn’t choose to side with one of these individuals so quickly?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I wonder if little brother Shi knows of fairy Yue Chan?” Right at this moment, a male spoke. He wore green battle clothes that flowed with golden luster. His entire body was flourishing with vitality and green light.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The eyes of this person looked like the stars, and his hair was dark green and flowing with the mysterious force of symbols. He was extremely powerful. This individual seemed to be rather concerned about fairy Yue Chan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao smiled and said, “Of course I know of her. We’ve even exchanged pointers before.” It was fine regardless of how they interpreted it. He didn’t say whether they were enemies or friends, allowing them to think what they would of it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh? Could it be that you are an acquaintance of hers?” Bi Gu asked. His divine senses were rippling extremely powerfully, far surpassing the amount of foundational force a youth his age should have.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the side, Xuan Ming’s eyes erupted with radiance. His body became covered in golden divine flames, and a layer of unique holy radiance covered his skin; he looked powerful and terrifying. After hearing these words, he also began to carefully ask. He put away his indifference and nodded towards Shi Hao before saying, “I must ask you for help then. I would like to pay the fairy a visit.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t know where she is recently either. Are you all close to her?” Shi Hao pretended to be astonished, pretending not to know that Yue Chan was from the higher realms.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yue Chan is known as a transcendent individual. It has been many years since I have last seen her. She was praised by many seniors to be a holy immortal being when she wasn’t very old. Her appearance is exceptional, and her talent is peerless,” Bi Gu explained. The memory he had of her back then was unforgettable.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Based on what he said, the lower realm’s natural laws were deficient and the great dao incomplete. However, it was still a good place for one to sharpen themself. Yue Chan’s status was exceedingly high, and great hopes had been placed onto her. As a result, she was brought down to the lower realm to improve her cultivation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hong Huang muttered in a rather discontent tone, saying, “Hey, you really are being quite honest while saying all that in front of so many peerless and beautiful people. Could it be that we are inferior?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Of course not. You all are outstanding beauties, so how many people can compare in the current world?” Bi Gu hurriedly spoke.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao laughed. Comparatively speaking, back then, Bi Gu wasn’t even that old when he saw Yue Chan, yet the impression he had of her was actually that deep and unforgettable.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This world is lacking and the natural laws are incomplete. Would there really be any benefit in coming down to sharpen oneself?” Shi Hao brought up this problem.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“For you all, there is harm. However, since Yue Chan was born in the higher realms, there is a perfect dao core within her. Coming down to cultivate would bring about great benefits.” Bi Gu replied.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao was left speechless. This heaven and earth cage really treated them quite unfairly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he didn’t become discouraged either. Sooner or later, he was going to enter the higher realms and deal with everything. He was going to refine everything he had into one furnace and become even more powerful.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, he thought of the ancient era’s dual-pupiled woman, the undefeated legend who dared to steal food from the mouths of supreme beings. Even though he hadn’t reached the pinnacle of cultivation and was stuck in this realm, he would still definitely have a way of settling the problem.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are brother Shi and Yue Chan rather familiar? Can you tell us about her current situation?” Xuan Ming spoke. Powerful aura surged as his eyes opened and closed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao was shocked inwardly. The noble women and young disciples from the higher realms were extraordinary as expected. They were all extremely powerful geniuses. To have such achievements at their age was truly quite amazing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a smile, he said, “Me and Yue Chan are companions on the path of cultivation. We frequently swap pointers. I can only describe her as exceptional and brilliant.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By the door, Qin Ming’s mouth twitched. He was truly lying through his teeth! They were clearly hostile, and right now, there were suspicions that fairy Yue Chan became the little Stone’s captive and served at his side.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he didn’t dare randomly speak about such baseless rumors. Otherwise, the Heaven Mending Sect might act out, and the young men in front of him would definitely erupt with rage, causing great trouble.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soon after, Qin Ming then frowned again. After carefully examining the little Stone’s words, he noticed that there weren’t many holes in what he said. It was just a companion on the road of cultivation, and they frequently swapped pointers. He didn’t mention whether they were hostile or friendly towards each other. This little fellow was quite crafty.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Several individuals tried to find out more about the situation and asked Shi Hao for information. He answered them one by one.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Where is brother Shi headed?” Shui Yue asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Attending a meeting in the Immortal Mountain.” Shi Hao replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Aiya</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">, it truly is tempting! I want to go as well. The Immortal Mountain’s people are quite formidable. I want to go there and get my hands on one or two of their secret texts.” Hong Huang really didn’t show much restraint.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why not? I heard that the Immortal Mountain has some great secret in the lower realm, and that there is something good buried in their ancient land. We should go and take a look.” The young lady Ying Ying spoke as well and joined in on the excitement.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Heh</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">, are you all purposely stirring up trouble in the lower realm because you find ‘that person’ in the higher realm Immortal Mountain unpleasant?” Someone laughed mischievously.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Actually, that fellow came to the lower realms as well, but didn’t come together with us. We don’t know where that person went.” A young lady muttered.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Forget it, we have other plans, so it’s better if we don’t go to the Immortal Mountain. Otherwise, trouble might easily happen. Let’s just look for our own opportunities.” Shui Yue said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xuan Ming nodded. Even though it looked like they came down to go sightseeing and gain experience, the real reason was to search for a tremendous opportunity. There were a few secret areas they had to explore.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brother Shi, you should take some time to think things over first. If you want to enter the higher realms, we can discuss it in detail when we meet again.” Lan Yu nodded. Her bearing was exceptional. Blue specks of light poured down like rain. She had already gotten up and excused herself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These people didn’t stay behind for too long. After talking for a bit, they all got up and left.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Ming released a breath of relief. Just now, he truly was rather fearful of disaster. This was a group of higher realms’ elites. If any of them fought against the little Stone, it would be a great disaster. Great trouble would be stirred up regardless of which one of them fell.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My clan’s heaven warping talent didn’t travel with them. He’s probably travelling with another group,” he said softly. Then, he looked at Shi Hao who was currently thinking things through carefully and said, “We’ll reach Immortal Mountain in a few days. I will explain a few rules and regulations here first.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m the human emperor. Are you telling me to have an audience with someone else?” Shi Hao shot him a cold look. He closed his eyes in meditation and no longer paid him any attention.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Ming’s face became downcast. In front of the little Stone, the high and mighty Immortal Mountain’s name no longer seemed to be that useful. It wasn’t able to pressure him in the slightest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Several days later, the large boat stopped. It rested by a holy cliff that flowed with hazy and colorful lights. Immortal energy surged, and the various symbols looked like stars as they flickered about.&nbsp;</span></p>

It took five days of effort, and each day, they travelled a million li. The road ahead was another five hundred or so li. It was rather shocking.&nbsp;</span></p>
