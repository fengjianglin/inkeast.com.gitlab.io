This is the body of a divine bug!” The great doctor Zhang Zhong also came here. He browsed through these ‘old objects’ and picked up a black object. It looked like a piece of iron, and when it was struck, metallic sounds could be heard.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was quite shocked. After carefully identifying it, he discovered that it was a divine bug known as Blackgold Bug. It could be used in medicine, a divine bug that could only be discovered but not sought.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was clear that this bug had already matured.

Back then, Stone Country’s ancestral land was truly formidable. A mature divine bug like this possessed divine level battle strength, but they unexpectedly killed one, leaving it behind in the village.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Formidable, truly formidable!” Everyone sighed in amazement.&nbsp;</span></p>

What a pity it is that we are missing too many ingredients, or else we definitely would have tried to refine it…” The War King sighed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was rumored that as long as the nine revolutions pill was successfully refined, as long as one took it, they could immediately transcend and become a deity. This was an incredibly precious holy ancient medicine. Since the ancient times, only a few people successfully refined it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unfortunately, in order to refine this pill, one needed many divine level medicinal herbs, or else they could forget about it. It was just too far fetched a dream. If they really had this pill, Shi Hao truly might have a chance of surviving.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This pill isn’t something that will appear if we beg. A single batch is hard to find after tens of thousands of years.” Zhang Zhong shook his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone sighed. In the end, it was still too much of a dream.&nbsp;</span></p>

Unfortunately, two astonishing items were already beyond their expectations. There weren’t any other special medicinal herbs or other objects.&nbsp;</span></p>

However, it was just a weapon and could not save one’s life.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Stone Village’s people felt gloomy and frustrated.

Hairy Ball and Little Red appeared. One lost a portion of its body, the other a pair of wings. They were already severely injured and unable to move freely.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, they still came. These were two deities! This shocked everyone here!&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For a long time, there was no sound in the spacious great palace. It was extremely quiet. The two sank into a state of silence.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only after a long time had passed did Shi Hao open his mouth and say, “Do you think that if one person had two supreme being bones, they will be able to become number one under heaven?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who would be able to rival that?” Qin Hao asked in response.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“When you brought up that topic, I remembered the higher realms. There are actually more than a single ‘exceptional talent’. Perhaps there are also people who obtained two bones,” Shi Hao said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Hao was stunned. He had never heard of this before. This was definitely astonishing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In an extremely serious voice, he said, “I feel that the number of bones isn’t important. That isn’t the path to becoming the strongest. If there is a day when you become self-confident, feel that you can abandon your supreme being bone, not needing even a single piece, then, you can truly be considered to have stepped onto the path of no equal.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Hao didn’t agree to this and said, “If you have a higher starting point, why would you abandon it? I believe that the one with two pieces of bone will be more powerful. That person will become the number one supreme being.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Perhaps there are already people like that in the higher realms.” Shi Hao said softly. He then stared at his own little brother and said, “If you feel that you can become the strongest expert like this, then let me give you a chance, let you soar to the very top. However, you have to properly think it through!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t know whether his younger brother was interested or not when he mentioned these things. However, it wasn’t important anymore, because he didn’t care about his supreme being bone anymore.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was going to die already, so what was the point in keeping it? Since this younger brother felt that having two bones would make him number one in the higher realms, then he’ll give his to him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao felt that regardless of what his younger brother was thinking, they were born from the same parents. In the future, Shi Hao still had to rely on him to take care of his father and mother.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“War King, Peng King, Zhang Zhong doctor…” Shi Hao called over these people.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your Majesty!” Several old kings all looked at him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am going to give my supreme being bone to my younger brother. Please protect us during this process.” Shi Hao said. He feared that others would misunderstand, so he called them over to explain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What? Your Majesty, you cannot!” These people were all shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Older brother…” Qin Hao also opened his mouth, not knowing what to say.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You don’t need to say too much!” Shi Hao was always a decisive person. Even in his weakest state, he was also like this. Divine radiance shot out from his pupils, making it hard for everyone here to speak.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His body was full of cracks to begin with. Right now, he forcefully struggled, and his chest directly exploded. Shi Hao resolutely and decisively removed the two-thirds of the bone that remained.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This bone was still sparkling white, but it was full of cracks. It was forcefully pieced together. Auspicious multicolored light was being released. Even though it left his body, it still looked like it was burning with immortal light.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your Majesty!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The War King and Peng King’s hearts were shaking. How powerful was the little Stone? Even before his end, he actually made this kind of action, making tears pour down from their old eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Great doctor Zhang Zhong, please help my younger brother accept this bone!” Shi Hao said. He calmly sat there, using his own strength to close his chest. Even though blood flowed out, he still didn’t move too much.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Stone Emperor!” Zhang Zhong was astonished. He never thought that this type of result would happen. Shi Hao instead gave his own supreme being bone to his younger brother.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ming King, Peng Nine, War King and the others rushed over to help Shi Hao stop the bleeding and help him. They all felt as if they were suffocating.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soon after, Stone Village’s people received news. Shi Ziling and Qin Yining also heard what happened. They rushed into the palace, all of them trembling.&nbsp;</span></p>

If there is a day you can transform them and use the supreme blood to nourish your entire body, allowing all of your bones to transform, that might be another path to the path of no equal.” Shi Hao said.&nbsp;</span></p>
