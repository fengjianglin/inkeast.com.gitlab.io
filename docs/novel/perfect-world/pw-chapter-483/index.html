 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Separated at childhood with no memories, Shi Hao’s heart felt slightly grieved. He had never enjoyed the familial love and joy between parent and child. He was abandoned by his clan and forced to roam about in the outside world since he was young.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Raised within Stone Village, he never had the chance to receive the warmth of staying at his mother and father’s side. He would at times be lonely, other times naughty or smiling brilliantly. He grew up within Stone Village in a simple-minded manner.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If the Willow Deity did not open his sea of consciousness to help him see his past, he wouldn’t even know what his parents looked like. After all, he was quite young at that time, only a year or so in age. He was raised as a foster child in the village.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Stone Village was his refuge and where he grew up. Later on, he never met his parents again, and at times, he almost forgot about them. There was no news whatsoever about them, nor was there a day when they could be reunited.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Father, mother, are you both well?” Shi Hao said softly. Right now, he was different from his normally resolute and daring self, his mood somewhat distracted. The softest part within him had been touched, giving him a bitter and somewhat aching feeling.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fortunately, Stone Village’s people were all down-to-earth, taking him in as one of their own. This allowed him to grow up happily and without worries.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only, inside, he always felt as if he was missing something. Others always had mothers and fathers, and only he could never experience that special familial feeling.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ve already grown up.” Shi Hao said to himself, his gaze gradually becoming resolute.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He relied on himself and travelled through the great wastelands alone. Even though he was still a youth, he used his power to shake the wasteland region and overlook his peers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This type of accomplishment was unfathomable. He was originally an abandoned child that lost his supreme being bone and was fated to die. However, in the end, he relied on himself to persevere through. No one sent him any divine medicines to help him survive. However, he persistently fought on for survival, and he grew up healthily, sweeping through all enemies to become the human emperor he was today.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“When are we departing?” Qin Ming asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He saw that Shi Hao was a bit emotional and noticed the changes to his expressions, which made him feel a bit happy inside. It seems like the little Stone was a person who felt great emotions. As such, there was no need to be worried that he wouldn’t give in.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew that the couple had not entered the higher realms yet. They were inside the Immortal Mountain, and they should possess enough influence over this youth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao recovered his composure, his eyes deep as he sat on the throne. As he looked downwards, it was incredibly imposing, the calmness and steadiness not matching his age. This type of gaze made the pressure Qin Ming faced increase several times. He was inwardly shocked. He was also a king level figure, but when faced against the little Stone, he felt like he was facing an unmatched supreme individual that could not be defied. He couldn’t help but shiver in fear.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You may leave first. I’m awaiting news.” Shi Hao spoke.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That decree…” Qin Ming’s eyes fluttered towards the golden decree the little Stone casually tossed onto the table. He truly wished to obtain it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This decree was not an ordinary object. There was the Immortal Mountain’s mark formed from their divine imprint that possessed profound laws. In addition, the old ancestor had written the words. They shone with brilliance, possessing mysterious force and divine might.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This decree lightly rested on the table, and when it was spread out, golden light flowed outwards like a divine flame. Every single character would be engraved in space.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you have any complaints?” Shi Hao coldly asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Ming’s expression dropped, not daring to request for the decree any longer. Even though it could be refined into a magical artifact with a deity’s aura, he didn’t dare ask for it again. After all, this was a decree issued to the little Stone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He hurriedly withdrew. Before leaving, he saw the little Stone casually tear apart the golden paper before crumpling it into a lump, making the corners of his mouth twitch.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the great calamity having just passed, the eight regions were in chaos. Every sect wished to stabilize their situation, as they were all powerless to wage war. They were all trying to deal with the disaster that had been brought upon them and wanted to stabilize their inheritances.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This wasn’t true for only the wasteland region. Even the foreign sects that had ties with the higher realms encountered disaster. They were all attacked to varying degrees, making the overall atmosphere rather tense. What they needed the most right now was a peaceful period.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As such, Shi Hao didn’t have to worry about much. Right now, the imperial capital was quite stable. His rise to power temporarily intimidated everyone inside the country.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao summoned the War King, Peng Nine and the others. After making some arrangements, he waited another two days. He carefully prepared a few things and then prepared to set off.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fairy Yue Chan definitely couldn’t be left in the palace, for who knew what type of accidents could happen. There were definitely secrets on this woman’s body, so Shi Hao would not be at ease unless she was suppressed at his side. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If others were to find that he had imprisoned the holy fairy that countless people admired within that bronze piece’s world, they would definitely go mad. This… was inconceivable!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is a space piercing boat.” Outside Stone Capital, Qin Ming introduced. His voice carried a type of confidence, as this was a precious boat created by the Immortal Mountain. It possessed great speed, allowing it to travel a hundred thousand li in a day.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The boat was was a greenish black in color and flowed with a special radiance. It was unknown what type of material it was made out of. It wasn’t large, only several zhang in length. It was a magical artifact that could travel quickly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the very center, the primordial symbolled bones of various birds were placed. These allowed the boat to maintain a fast speed, making it an essential tool for crossing the boundless earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao curled his lips and said, “So small. If I knew it was going to be like this, I would have brought one from the imperial palace.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His voice was indifferent as if he didn’t seem to care that much about it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This immediately made Qin Ming stop talking. He was originally quite proud of it, and with the Immortal Mountain’s level of magical artifacts, it was truly enough to overlook the world, yet right now, he could only keep his mouth shut.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the end, the little Stone was a human emperor. Even though Stone Country wasn’t as great as the Immortal Mountain, there were still some wondrous treasures that could be found within the treasury of a country. After all, they had been accumulated since the ancient times.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A hundred thousand li a day is too slow. How long will it take for us to reach the destination?” Shi Hao appeared rather unsatisfied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We will head for Fire Nation first.” Qin Ming said. He was inwardly scared, but he also carried his own resentment and cold laughter.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let me control the boat.” Shi Hao said. He recklessly used it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the next moment, the Immortal Mountain’s king figure was horrified. He noticed that the entire boat seemed to have ignited. Divine force surged madly as it shot outwards like a divine arrow.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the end of the boat, the little Stone stood firm and unshakable. His entire body shone, and the unending divine force poured out like a sea and filled this place, wrapping itself around the entire flying boat.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This type of divine force was too terrifying, simply vast and boundless. It made Qin Ming’s face become pale. They were both king level figures, yet why was the difference between them so big?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No wonder he could fight against supreme experts. Even if one uses the imperial palace’s draconic energy, they still needed to be powerful enough themself…” He trembled inwardly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then, Qin Ming cried out again. The speed of this boat was just too quick, long exceeding its limit. It turned into a streak of light and sped through the skies.&nbsp;</span></p>

He originally should have sent the decree to the little Stone a long time ago, and he had even berated Shi Hao after he was ignored. As a result, it was dragged on again and again, delaying the visit for a long time.&nbsp;</span></p>

However, right now, it was actually controlled by the Immortal Mountain. When they came to a stop, cracks appeared everywhere on the boat and electricity flickered about. It was about to explode. Not exploding along the way was already something to be glad about.&nbsp;</span></p>

There was a powerful formation in this enormous city that could join together the walls between regions, connecting them to one of the border regions of the mysterious region.&nbsp;</span></p>

If one wanted to travel across on their own, they might not see the end of one after traveling their entire lives. Furthermore, it was quite difficult to cross regions right now due to walls being unnaturally firm. Normal people could never make it past.&nbsp;</span></p>
