The old servant reached out his hand to block the attack. His finger struck down on the great halberd, releasing a metallic sound. He then borrowed this force to bounce back far into the sky.&nbsp;</span></p>

The supreme being bone clearly suppressed him, so why did he seem like he was becoming more and more formidable? The effects of the supreme being bone’s symbols shouldn’t have expired yet.&nbsp;</span></p>

His aura began to flourish with greater and greater power. Even though his appearance was still old and his skin was sagging, his entire being became more dangerous.&nbsp;</span></p>

Wrong, my Immortal Crane Race is one with extremely long lifespans. Moreover, before coming down to the lower realm, Immortal Palace even bestowed a divine pill onto me that can increase my vitality. Thanks to you, I was able to borrow your supreme being symbols to dissolve the final bit of medicinal strength of that divine pill, allowing it to completely merge with myself.”</span></p>

It was just something I had to do in the most desperate situation.” Huang Yu’s gaze was indistinct.&nbsp;</span></p>

In reality, the most important reason was that the difference in strength between the two of them was too great. The old servant was quite a bit more powerful than normal deities that ignited their divine flame.&nbsp;</span></p>

Shi Hao turned around and fled. Huang Yu naturally rushed after him in pursuit. Brilliant light seeped out from his eyes when they opened and closed.&nbsp;</span></p>

It was the true immortal crane wings. It was even more ferocious than before. Countless golden feathers danced about, and together with those wings, they swept out a large expanse of light.&nbsp;</span></p>

When they were swept by the golden light, they all collapsed. Smoke and dust surged high into the air.&nbsp;</span></p>

Why don’t you come and have a taste of this old one’s magical artifact?” He opened his mouth and spat out a small golden hammer. Lightning streaked out towards Shi Hao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">En?</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">” Shi Hao was astonished. This wasn’t a normal attack. The small hammer released the sound of thunder, and there was lightning hacking over with extreme speed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Go!” Huang Yu shouted loudly. The lightning hammer shone and rumbled with noise. It collided with the true deity magical artifact in Shi Hao’s hands, leaving him greatly shaken and coughing blood from his mouth.&nbsp;</span></p>

A black wave rose from behind him. A Kun fish brandished its tail. Its enormous body surged with endless black great yin energy to defend against Huang Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The black wave released the force of great yin, boundless and chilly, a power that surged with a ‘soft’ force as it attacked the Immortal Palace’s old servant.&nbsp;</span></p>

Blinding light erupted between the two sides. It was as if an explosion from outer space took place here. Endless rays of light shot out in all directions, immediately sending Shi Hao flying outwards.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The difference in strength between the two sides was just too great to make up. Shi Hao’s life was at risk. If this continued, he would undoubtedly die!</span></p>

He reached out a large hand and grabbed outwards. This was a divine ability that contained a world within the palm. It surrounded heaven and earth, completely covering this place.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it was just someone at the same cultivation level as Shi Hao that displayed this attack, then that would be that. However, this was an old monster that was attacking. His cultivation realm was too high. Shi Hao’s expression changed. It was too hard to escape from this little world. He had to fight with everything he had and stake it all!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Open!”</span></p>

A pair of Kun Peng wings appeared behind him, one pitch-black like ink, one blazing brilliantly with golden light. The two collided together, erupting with yin and yang energies, merging together. There were wisps of chaotic energy seeping out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">En?</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">” Huang Yu was astonished. A crack appeared in the palm world. Shi Hao actually broke out.&nbsp;</span></p>

If I can successfully cultivate it, my strength will definitely double!” The old servant was also of a bird race, so he naturally desired this type of precious technique. His eyes were burning with passion.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two sides fought while moving, their bodies quickly flying above the mountain range.

The sparkling black seeds contained powerful divine might. If not for these, he would have long ran out of energy.&nbsp;</span></p>

His body was covered in hidden injuries, and they were all inflicted by Huang Yu through the battle halberd. His blood vessels, bones, and other areas were all injured.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With his powerful build, how many people in the lower realm could injure him?

He landed on an altar. Without batting an eyelid, he opened up a passageway to escape.&nbsp;</span></p>

He had investigated Shi Hao carefully beforehand. He went missing when he was still young, and when he reappeared, he regrew the supreme being bone and displayed outstanding accomplishments.&nbsp;</span></p>

The time limit had passed, so he could use the supreme being bone again. He erupted with divine might. The little figure flew out from his chest again, once again defying space as it rushed over.&nbsp;</span></p>

He changed from being aged back to being young. His white hair first turned black, and then his skin developed luster again, no longer sagging. Finally, his eyes became sharper than before.&nbsp;</span></p>

Even though Huang Yu’s current dao wasn’t as great as when he was older, the difference wouldn’t be too excessive. He was still a level higher than Shi Hao, making him extremely difficult to kill.&nbsp;</span></p>

Magma roiled through this place, and the world was full of spiritual essence. He even saw a group of fish moving within the scarlet liquid, leaving him so surprised he couldn’t help but say, “These are Flame Fish, no, these are a mutation of Flame Fish, Yang Fish! They are known to reside in places of great yang force and possess great divine substance!”</span></p>

He had a feeling that something wasn’t right with what happened just now. As expected, there were problems. He had acted too rashly during that desperate situation.
