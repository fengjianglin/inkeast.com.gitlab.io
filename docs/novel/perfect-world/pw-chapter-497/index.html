It was like an arid desert that received the moisture of rain, or a melodious flute’s music within a desolate valley. Vitality was brought to the desolate.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Shi Hao immersed himself within this feeling, he almost felt intoxicated. He could clearly feel the supreme being bone becoming more active. It was calling out and wishing to grow again. It wanted to break away from its shackles and evolve into its perfect state.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His chest was sparkling and flowing with multicolored light. The little person that sat on top of the precious bone was surrounded by a divine ring of light. If one looked carefully, they would find that the so-called rings of light were formed from symbols.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was heavenly text, a portion of the mysterious symbols that emerged from Shi Hao’s bones. They were now arranging themselves and recombining to evolve into something supreme and profound.&nbsp;</span></p>

His supreme being bone was sparkling and translucent, and the symbols on the surface became more and more clear. They emerged around the fist height little figure and formed divine chains of order.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, it was bursting with vitality. The origin of life was being carried out here on a smaller scale. It contained the world’s simplest yet most powerful natural laws.&nbsp;</span></p>

This was the first time he felt so close to the supreme being bone. He felt like if he used it, it would produce a heavenly divine ability and destroy all of his enemies.&nbsp;</span></p>

It almost couldn’t be compared to how it was in the past.&nbsp;</span></p>

It can now mature on its own, and together with external nourishment, it would naturally grow back even faster.&nbsp;</span></p>

There was only a clump of dust left over there. Qin Wu’s arm shattered and disappeared in midair.&nbsp;</span></p>

His eyes were extremely penetrating. The magical sword in his hand took in and sent out sharp energy, as if it was going to hack out at any moment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not far out, a&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">peng</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;sounded. A large hole was sliced open in the void, and the husband and wife were able to see this scene. They were both shaken and moved emotionally.</span></p>

He has reached this level…” The beautiful woman’s voice trembled as she spoke. She found it hard to believe what she was seeing and was incomparably moved. Tears also slid down her face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She still remembered that little infant in swaddling clothes who was extremely weak and about to die at any moment. More than ten years later, he actually stood tall above the world of mortals and defied deities.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hao’er!” The male shouted loudly with hot tears slid down from his eyes. His fists were tightly clenched, and his chest was violently rising and falling.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They clearly saw Qin Wu’s arm being sliced off. Blood descended from the sky together with silver light. His face was ashen. He was completely trapped and in a desperate situation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just how exceptional was this youth? Was that the child they left behind in Stone Village? He even looked down on deities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without them at his side, he survived and became this powerful on his own. To be able to reach this level, exactly what kind of path did he travel through? The husband and wife’s chests were rapidly rising and falling.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They felt regret, yet they also missed him. The two both felt a stream of heat rising from their hearts. Their eyes were blurry. Joy, sadness, pain, excitement, all types of emotions were surging.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the crack was quickly closed again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He did not die and entered the higher realms. My Immortal Mountain did not cause trouble for him.” Qin Wu replied. His fists tightened and his teeth were clenched. He felt incredibly ashamed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was actually forced to talk about the past in front of a mortal. He was humiliated inwardly and wanted to take action again, but in the end, he powerlessly loosened his fist.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Didn’t cause trouble for him? Why do the valley walls have arrow holes? My grandfather clearly fought a great battle here and was injured by Qin Zhan, causing him to spit out blood here. These are things I already know, yet you are still trying to deceive me!” Shi Hao erupted with rage.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There were some complicated matters that occured, but he did ultimately enter the higher realms. Regardless, this is a tremendous opportunity where one can break free from the entrapment of the mortal world.” Qin Wu said in a heavy tone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao revealed his ten heavenly passages, releasing the heavily wounded Qin Fa and Qin Zhan out. He separately pointed his sword at them before asking them where his grandfather was.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their expressions were ugly to look at. Qin Zhan was a madman and refused to reply. Qin Fa felt great fear. He even saw the old ancestor defeated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What he knew was limited, because he didn’t witness it himself and only heard about it afterwards. The Great Demonic God brought a young lady called A’man with him, but then he was beaten until he coughed out large amounts of blood outside the valley by the madman.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The great demonic god came to the Immortal Mountain full of hopes and affection, yet he encountered a disaster. Shi Hao was furious after hearing this, and with a&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">pu</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;sound, the crazy Qin Zhan was sliced into two.&nbsp;</span></p>

He was going to rescue his loved ones and capture the Immortal Mountain, so he would eventually find out everything anyway.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You…” Qin Wu’s face was both green and white. A powerful supreme expert fell in front of his face just like that. It was pitiful and painful.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not even the Immortal Mountain had that many supreme experts. Their strengths were great, making them extremely precious. Being casually killed by someone like this was a tremendous loss.&nbsp;</span></p>

Meanwhile, Qin Hao didn’t say anything when he saw this. He stood in the corner while holding the silver spear.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t kill me! Your grandfather and that young lady are unharmed. I don’t know what happened exactly, but they entered my Immortal Mountain’s formation and ascended into the heavens to enter the higher realms.” Qin Fa cried out loudly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Zhan’s blood had splashed down onto his body, making him feel great fear. Even though they were both supreme experts, not everyone pursued darkness and didn’t fear death. He already talked about everything he knew about.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The golden lightning formed a large expanse. The magical sword in Shi Hao’s hands formed a golden Suan Ni. Lightning flickered, turning Qin Fa into ashes, blasting him apart in the air.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many people from the Immortal Mountain hurried over. When they saw this scene, they all kept quiet out of fear. Shi Hao unleashed a slaughter, killing two powerful experts. What kind of boldness was this?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“By trampling on Immortal Mountain’s dignity, you will inevitably wither away. You will fall!” Qin Wu shouted loudly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He chanted an incantation from his mouth. He knew that he could not escape from this place, so he no longer worried about anything else and ignited himself. He was going to sacrifice himself to summon the Immortal Mountain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You should just fall as well.” Shi Hao’s voice was cold and detached. Now that things had reached this point, there was no point in having any hesitation. He just needed to walk forward.&nbsp;</span></p>

It seemed to have existed before the heavens were opened and was created from the primal chaos. There were natural gods and devils in the mountains before, so it could be said that it was unimaginably powerful.&nbsp;</span></p>
