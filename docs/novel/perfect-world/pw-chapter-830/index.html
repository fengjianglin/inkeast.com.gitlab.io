Apart from the geniuses that gathered when they first entered, it would usually be incomparably desolate. Even a pin drop could be heard.</span></p>

These three thousand ancient paths carried an aura of passed time. It was completely quiet.&nbsp;</span></p>

Once he continued from here, it would be extremely dangerous. None of those that treaded on this path since the ancient times had good conclusions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Specks of scarlet multicolored light flickered about, shining with resplendent red light. This was a stalk of holy medicine that looked like red coral, something he seized from the hands of Underworld Clan. He brought it out and gave it to the distant Emperor Butterfly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Youngster, you truly are prejudiced. That is a stalk of holy medicine, yet you are giving it out so generously! I just wanted those few stones, yet it required so much effort from me…” The Divine Striking Stone said with discontent.&nbsp;</span></p>

They were all given to you.”</span></p>

It carried the red coral resplendent precious medicine and began to eat it. At the same time, it didn’t forget to nod its head towards Shi Hao in gratitude.&nbsp;</span></p>

Its usefulness and power left him completely shocked back then.&nbsp;</span></p>

It came from the depths of the uninhabited region and then entered the lower realm.</span></p>

It was precisely this instance that was remembered by people of later generations.&nbsp;</span></p>

Only a few people saw it dancing lightly and gracefully about, witnessed the unmatched might of splitting apart heavenly deities with a flap of its wings.&nbsp;</span></p>

He rubbed his arm. There were scars and blood traces there.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he fought against Luo Dao, the other party’s hair suddenly expanded, wrapping around his forearm, bringing him a set amount of injuries. Even though it wasn’t fatal, he was still injured.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao reflected on his current self. The dao flames he had ignited himself with thus far through the bluestone path hadn’t truly displayed any heaven defying applications. The reason he was powerful right now was completely due to his foundation, the accumulation of his past.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Unless I ignite a few hundred or even over a thousand, only then should there be some special areas, right?”</span></p>

If he used several hundred to over a thousand, how terrifying would that be?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao knew that his road was only starting, and that this was only the beginning of it all. The true dangers and life and death trials were still ahead.&nbsp;</span></p>

Strand after strand of weak light turned into symbols, gathering towards one area and surrounding a youth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One path, two paths...</span></p>

Fiery light burned, drowning him within. This place became resplendent with radiance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon closer inspection, one would find that the flames were covered in symbols. Patterns interweaved and linked up to form an exuberant blaze, wrapping around Shi Hao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was what he had already experienced, and now that he was walking this path again, it no longer damaged his body.&nbsp;</span></p>

As a result, fiery light surged, entering his stomach from his mouth and nose. His entire body surged with divine flames.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Keng qiang!</span></p>

A furnace slowly took form, wrapping him within. Then, it began to gather the force of heaven and earth, forming a simple and ancient artifact.</span></p>

There were symbols that extended outwards and fiery light that gathered, burning this cauldron. Radiance shone in all directions, rushing into the clouds.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This ancient place was no longer calm. Shi Hao’s life and death trial had begun. The dao flames were increased, added one after another. They were like divine chains of hope, but also like divine chains of death as they revolved around him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A hundred and nine, a hundred and ten…”</span></p>

As time went on, it had reached a hundred and fifty. Shi Hao felt like the flames were difficult to endure, his entire body in intense pain, about to be burned through.&nbsp;</span></p>

He had just added a few dozen, yet his body was already injured. There were still so many left to go, so how was he going to complete this process?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t feel dejected, however, nor did he become discouraged. He resolutely advanced step by step. He was going to succeed! There was hope within his heart, divine light shining brilliantly within his eyes. His will was still firm.&nbsp;</span></p>

Only a few dozen streaks were added, yet the power increased by such a great amount.&nbsp;</span></p>

These flames were just too great, about to burn through even the heaven and earth furnace. It was already starting to distort.&nbsp;</span></p>

He wasn’t going to repeat the paths of those before him, but would only use them as a reference. He was treating them like flames to ignite a true self.</span></p>

When he ignited the two hundredth flame, his body was dried and withered, incomparably weak. His vitality seemed like it was about to lose all life force. His body was was scorched black, now even worse than the first time. There were many holes that connected from front to back, shining like two golden lamps, illuminating this place.&nbsp;</span></p>

They roamed about like dragons, scattering over his entire body.</span></p>

Even though he was on the verge of being destroyed by fire, he felt as if he could free himself from his flesh and observe everything objectively. Sometimes, he would even forget the suffering and only feel a type of comprehension towards the dao.&nbsp;</span></p>
