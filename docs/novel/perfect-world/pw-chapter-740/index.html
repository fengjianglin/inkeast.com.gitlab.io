Even though the higher realms were vast and boundless, this academy’s long tradition and powerful name shook the three thousand provinces. It was an inheritance that stood at the peak.&nbsp;</span></p>

When they were all linked up together, it exceeded the enormous city. The amount of area they occupied was terrifyingly great.</span></p>

This region was too large! Even after walking around for more than two hours, he still didn’t reach the academy’s entrance. It had to be mentioned that there really were treasures that could be exchanged for with other rare hidden treasures.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was to the extent where he even saw an archaic vicious beast precious technique that could be directly purchased!</span></p>

At the very least, Shi Hao saw a few youngsters that surrounded that place, looking at the bone book and assessing that precious technique’s price.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, this wasn’t the only example. There were other rare great divine abilities marked for sale.&nbsp;</span></p>

Goddess Academy really is quite formidable.” Shi Hao couldn’t help but sigh in admiration.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Someone on the side heard him say this and said, “But of course. This is one of the higher realms’ greatest cultivation holy lands. Many great clans send their disciples here, so this is a place where countless geniuses gather. Many of the families behind these youngsters have the ability to purchase these things.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“However, those precious techniques aren’t complete. They more or less have some faults, and after they are sold, they can’t be leaked outwards, or else they will be reproached. After all, the original owner of the technique wishes to sell more copies of this technique.” Someone said.&nbsp;</span></p>

You know too little about Goddess Academy! These auctions are not simple. They are supported by great figures, or else they wouldn’t dare to do this. Rumor has it that the backer is Goddess Academy’s Heavenly deities surnamed Su</span></span><a href="#footnote-0117">[1]</a><span>. They sell the spoils of war and precious techniques here.”</span></span></p>

Since they couldn’t use them either, as a result, these divine abilities were passed on down here.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Apart from this, the geniuses of the academy, if they obtained any divine abilities when gaining experience in the outside world and didn’t need them, they could also sell them here.</span></p>

After walking a large circle, he discovered that this was a place a place where good people and scumbags coexisted. Good items were mixed with rubbish. There were quite a few fake goods.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unknowingly when, he arrived in front of Goddess Academy’s enormous gates. This was a gate that had existed since the archaic era.</span></p>

There were auspicious beasts and divine birds engraved on their surfaces. They were filled with an ancient aura. The gate building was vast and tall. It seemed to carry a feeling of great age that seemed to embody a great history.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without a doubt, Goddess Academy was a sacred place. It was a cultivation holy land in the hearts of many. Even large clans didn’t hesitate to send their geniuses over provinces, all for the sake of seeking the dao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Inside the academy, there were ancient relics, Heavenly deity magical halls, and the private room of the sect master.

This was a continuing tradition of their inheritance that was used to protect the sect. However, the insights that were recorded were still extremely useful for other outstanding talents.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was also the place most young talents yearned for the most.

It’s obviously Feng Wu, the exceptional immortal beauty. She already entered several times. This is a preparation for the three thousand province great battle of geniuses!”</span></p>

It was because they could see this scene even from outside the academy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao was also shocked. Great waves stirred within his mind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Multicolored mists pervaded the air. The might that majestic figure released rushed into the ninth firmament, not scattering for a long time. It was not any inferior to the War Emperor or Old Celestial.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, these were just the effects caused by some of the inscripted engravings, so one could see just how shocking the great natural luck stored within was.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That projection had already receded, disappearing without a trace. Only when that place was opened would the scene from just now appear. One could well imagine what kind of great benefits they could receive if they entered inside.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There are true immortal engravings inside? Is this true” Shi Hao asked the people around him, because he was greatly stirred up inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Country bumpkin! You just arrived? Not even knowing this, yet you still want to enter Goddess Academy? It seems like someone else who wants to try his luck and bluff his way in has appeared. There’s no way you’ll get in.” A young lady at the academy entrance spoke. Her appearance was quite great, and her figure was impressive. She had a look of disdain on her face as she looked at Shi Hao. This was clearly a student of this academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hoa was shocked. Upon closer inspection, he found that this young lady was extremely beautiful and extremely rarely seen.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What are you looking at? Stop obstructing the academy entrance.” The young lady spoke, her tone full of disgust. Her mood seemed to be quite terrible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Junior disciple is saying that our academy is not a place anyone can enter. Only one out of a thousand geniuses are chosen, and all of those geniuses are elites of their clans.” A young man smiled and spoke. He carried a somewhat currying tone as he looked at that woman, his face carrying a warm expression. Then, he looked at Shi Hao and said with a voice full of scorn, “You look like you are twenty-one or two years of age already, still in the Formation Arrangement Realm, yet you still want to enter my academy? I advise you to return and cultivate bitterly for a few more years.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What does an eighteen year old Formation Arrangement Realm cultivator have to show off? There are a few excellent figures your age that are already about to light their divine flames!” That extremely beautiful girl released a snort.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She wore green clothes that were like lotus leaves, setting her off like flower buds, tender and gorgeous. She was extremely outstanding, curves undulating up and down. Her skin color was like snow, her appearance outstanding and truly beautiful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was clear that the surrounding people noticed the scolding voices on this side. Many of them looked over, and there was no lack of academy disciples among them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yi</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">, isn’t this Chen Lin of the ten beauties? Why is she so upset? Her mood seems to be quite terrible.” There were some who revealed looks of admiration.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shush, lower your voice. The academy has recently produced a ranking of beauties, and Chen Lin has been squeezed down to eleventh place, not ranking in the top ten beauties anymore. Rumor has it that the newly arrived Qing Yi entered the rankings. Her pure and exceptional temperament has made many junior and senior brothers feel like they are as light as a feather.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">---</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Shi Hao still heard them. His divine senses were extremely sharp, and as such, he was shocked. No wonder this young lady he randomly met was so beautiful. It turns out she used to be a well known individual on Goddess Academy’s exceptional beauty rankings.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, he knew that Qing Yi was Yue Chan. She didn’t reveal her true body, or else an even greater uproar would be produced and her rankings would climb even higher.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The other reason why Goddess Academy was so well known was because of its stunning beauties. Since the ancient times, it was unknown just how many exceptional beauties have appeared here.</span></p>

Hurry and leave already. Stop standing in the way.” The young man that was trying to get on Chen Lin’s good side spoke again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Isn't that Wu Feng, one of the academy mid level top hundred experts? He’s been famous for a while.”</span></p>

It had to be said that the women on the beauty rankings had extremely great popularity. No matter where they went, there would always be a large group of flower protecting escorts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why do I have to leave? I wanted to enter Goddess Academy. Who knows, we might just be fellow disciples.” Shi Hao smiled and said, not getting angry.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the side, someone reminded Shi Hao that now wasn’t the time to accept disciples. It was because the last instance didn’t happen too long ago, so if he wanted to enter, he could only wait until next year.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s not that there’s no way. The academy’s great gates are always open to exceptional geniuses. If you can successfully walk up the heavenly staircase, then an exception can be made. Anyone can enter the academy at any time through this method,” someone said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There is this type of thing?” Shi Hao was shocked.&nbsp;</span></p>

Even you want to climb the heavenly staircase? Why don't you take a good look at yourself first!” Chen Lin said. Her face was full of contempt, and with an expression of disdain, she said, “Not knowing how high the heavens are or how deep the earth is.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is going on recently? The quality of newcomers really is going downhill. Any random dog and cat even dares to boast shamelessly in front of my academy.” Wu Feng echoed, ridiculing Shi Hao to curry favor with the ranked beauty.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the surroundings, shouts of laughter sounded. There were some of good will, but those carrying mockery as well. They all looked towards Shi Hao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Those that can make it through the heavenly staircase are definitely not ordinary geniuses. What kind of benefits are there?” Shi Hao didn’t get angry, instead humbly asking those around him for guidance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A few people revealed looks of shock. Was this youth really so daring that he was going to give it a try?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“After making it through the heavenly staircase, one will naturally become a super disciple. When the time comes, you can enter the immortal pond that the tribulation crossing divine lotus was planted in for a baptism, and even have a chance of bathing with the most famous unmatched ranked beauties, because they often have the chance to bathe and cultivate there.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What? That’s too awesome!” Shi Hao was so excited he almost screamed out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone looked at him, especially a few younger men who were laughing strangely. They all revealed ambiguous expressions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, a few young ladies’ faces became red. They inwardly spat out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was clear that everyone didn’t think he acted like that for the immortal pond, but instead that this fella had his eyes on the ranked gorgeous beauties.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that instant, Goddess Academy’s great gate became quiet.&nbsp;</span></p>
