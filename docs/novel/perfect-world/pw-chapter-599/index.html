Uncle will bring you home. We’ve wronged you.” Shi Linhu said with a trembling voice. He was a man that walked out from the great wastelands, a strong and well-built man, but right now, his eyes were red, and he was choking with sobs.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Go! Let’s go back!” Shi Feijiao walked up, preparing to lift up Shi Hao. When he saw the blood on his chest, his eyes widened, feeling incomparably sorrowful.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Child, you will become well again. Let’s go back to Stone Village. We’ll never come out again and forever spend out days in peace, withdrawing from worldly affairs!” Village Chief Shi Yunfeng said with a trembling voice. His rough hand caressed Shi Hao’s head and face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao forcefully nodded. Sincere and honest words, simple actions, this made a stream of heat flow from his heart. His nose felt sore, and hot tears rolled down his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The villagers didn’t think too much, coming over noisily. Their pain and sorrow were all written over their faces. They were simple and honest people, speaking true words that reflected their state of mind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dazhuang, Ermeng, Pihou and the others had all become adults already. This group of companions from his childhood surrounded him, tears rushing down from their eyes. They carried him up to go back to Stone Village.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Slow down.” The War King walked up. His face carried worry as well. He truly wanted to bring Shi Hao back to the wasteland region as well, but the state of Shi Hao’s body was too terrible and couldn’t handle being tossed from side to side.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In addition, he always carried that shred of hope of the immortal bone curing Shi Hao. Right now, he explained to Stone Village’s people in a soft voice.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Yunfeng’s hair was already white. When he heard this, his body trembled lightly and carefully brought out a small jade container. “I have something from undying spring here. Let’s use it first. It will be effective.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When something like this was brought out, it immediately left many people shocked. Those that stood here were all stupefied. They even had this kind of divine thing? Exactly what kind of background did Stone Village have? Everyone’s mouths were at a loss for words.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, Immortal Mountain’s Qin Clansmen became even more dumbstruck, not daring to believe all of this. This group of people looked extremely simple, yet they possessed even this type of heaven defying divine liquid.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This was something Hao’er risked his life to bring back. He wanted to leave it for the villagers, so we’ve held onto it all this time. Today, we can finally put it to good use.” The old clan chief sobbed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back then, Shi Hao obtained five drops of the Immortal Spring from the Hundred Shattering Mountains. It possessed life prolonging characteristics. He wanted to leave it behind for Stone Village to use.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the clan chief said this, his face that was covered in wrinkles was smiling but also crying. He was deeply touched.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Several years ago, just how old was Shi Hao? Yet he walked out into the great wastelands, entering the Hundred Shattering Mountains, proceeding into the Kun Peng nest, and encountering many powerful individuals. However, he back everything from the outside world back to the village.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone could deeply sense this youth’s pure intentions. He wanted the barren village to spend their days better.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the other side of the little Stone. Everyone saw how he rose to power, how his power inspired awe across the world, but they didn’t know that he still had this side to him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they carefully thought about it, those spiritual medicines, spiritual spring, and other things were all exchanged for with his life on the line. At that age, other children were still being protected by their parents and watched over by the clan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If he was still in good health, then that was one thing, but now, he fell from his previous splendid and awe-inspiring self to this greatly wounded and dying state. When they thought about this, everyone was greatly moved.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every drop from the Immortal Spring was like a small dragon. It possessed incredible spirituality as it moved about in the jade container. When the drop entered Shi Hao’s mouth, his entire body shone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a divine liquid that was rarely seen in the entire world. It could slow down aging and return youthfulness to a person. It was priceless.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the drop of divine liquid entered his body, Shi Hao’s complexion immediately improved a bit. A bit of rosy color returned to his face. The effects were instantaneous, improving his condition greatly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It was effective!” Everyone cried out in astonishment. This Immortal Spring was truly a life prolonging precious liquid.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t leave yet. We constructed a rebirth pool, and we already dissolved many spiritual pills into liquid. We will carry out a baptism for His Majesty to fight this illness.” Ming King spoke.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, Stone Country’s kings brought over too many medicinal herbs, and they also had bags of spiritual pills as if they were food. There was so much that it could be made into a large pile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three supreme experts, Shi Ziling, and his wife consulted a few great doctors, and after carefully analyzing the situation, they decided to form a rebirth pond to give it a try.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Immortal Mountain had a type of rebirth technique that was known as five elements rebirth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They had enough medicinal pills now. Qin Yining personally set it up, because she felt that she could make the perfect rebirth pond to cleanse Shi Hao’s flesh and restore his vitality. They were going to try to have him undergo rebirth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Since his condition has improved a bit, he might be truly successful. If we add a few drops of Immortal Spring, then the effects would be even greater.” The War King also spoke.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In reality, the supreme experts were still hoping that if they had no choice, that they could still use the immortal bone to save Shi Hao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was why they didn’t want him to leave. Otherwise, with how the Qin Clan was acting, the three supreme experts would have acted out a long time ago, fighting a great battle before leaving.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Stone Village’s people were discontent with the Qin Clan, but when they heard that doing this was beneficial towards Shi Hao, then they naturally decided to try it out. However, they angrily requested the Qin Clansmen’s people to stay away.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Raising this request in Immortal Mountain was also a type of humiliation towards the Qin Clan. However, Stone Village’s people were just that simple and straightforward. They didn’t have any good impressions of them. They didn’t trust Immortal Mountain at all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Child, we’re only going to stay here for one night and leave tomorrow. Let’s see if this rebirth pond will have any use,” said Village Chief Shi Yunfeng.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Linhu, Shi Feijiao, Ermeng, Pihou, and Qingfeng walked up as well, surrounding Shi Hao and personally looking after him, not letting any more people closer.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Great powers from all around the world came unendingly, making Immortal Mountain an extremely lively place. However, all of the sect masters and powerful individuals were blocked outside. This was an extremely important night, so no one was allowed close.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Inside the spiritual pool, auspicious energy rose and multicolored light swirled about. It looked like jade fluid. It was first a milky white, then a grassy green before turning into an earthen yellow. It was continuously changing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Grandpa Chief, I want to leave the immortal spring with Stone Village. Don’t waste it on my body anymore.” Shi Hao knew the state of his own body. He really didn’t want them to waste it like this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, how could they agree to this request? They had him bring this drop of divine liquid into the pond of rebirth to carry out the treatment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His body was covered in injuries, and the bones in his body were full of cracks. He was submerged in mist as soon as he entered. A large amount of spiritual essence poured into his body to nourish his injured body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It is effective!” Everyone was happy. They saw that Shi Hao’s body was shining. His injuries were wriggling about, and sounds of his bones touching could be heard. They felt like the pond was starting to work.&nbsp;</span></p>

It was unknown just how many spiritual pills were dissolved into this pond of medicinal liquid.&nbsp;</span></p>

They understood the structure and effects of the rebirth pool. Right now, their expressions were incomparably nervous.&nbsp;</span></p>

He then silently operated the technique. Back then, for the sake of rescuing his parents and searching for his grandfather, he had wreaked havoc here and obtained the five element rebirth secret passage.</span></p>

Other people didn’t know, but he understood clearly. The green rust curse symbols were becoming more and more concentrated, merging into the depths of his bones, making them incredibly difficult to expel.&nbsp;</span></p>

Stone Village’s people and Stone Country’s nobility all rushed over to ask together.</span></p>

His head was lowered, currently focusing his attention on carving a bone. That was the Kun Peng technique.&nbsp;</span></p>

Of course, Hao’er is someone from Stone Village, so his natural disposition is the same as us either. He will definitely refuse his younger brother’s bone. However, if he really is the younger brother and said something, even if Hao’er didn’t want it, we would at least feel a sense of warmth!” Shi Linhu said quietly.&nbsp;</span></p>

When he heard this, he sighed softly and said, “Stone Emperor looks like he is getting better, but he has always been exhausting his supreme being blood to prolong his own life. He still has unfulfilled wishes and wants to return home.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What?!” Everyone cried out in alarm.

It will be difficult for him to nourish that bone.” This was Zhang Zhong’s final conclusion.&nbsp;</span></p>
