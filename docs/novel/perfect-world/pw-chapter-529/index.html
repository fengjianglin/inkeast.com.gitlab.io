His palm moved past her snow white back, bringing him a smooth and soft sensation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What left him feel rather speechless and defeated was that little bumps quickly emerged on that smooth and satin-like sparkling skin, forming a layer of goosebumps.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, all of Yue Chan’s hair stood on end, feeling as if snakes or bugs were crawling on her body. Her entire body felt uncomfortable. She slapped him away with a single motion and said, “What I said was true.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You didn’t have to hurt my feelings like that right?” Shi Hao was discontent. He gently stroked her black sparkling hair and said, “I am a heaven warping martial talent with such a heroic appearance, yet I am so unsightly in your eyes that your body immediately becomes covered in goosebumps when I just touch you? That’s a bit unreasonable.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why do you never believe me when I am speaking with you honestly?” Yue Chan’s large eyes blinked. Bright radiance shone from them, giving her beautiful face a type pureness that was hard to resist.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao frowned and then said, “Then you can talk and I’ll listen. It’s clearly your main body and you two share an entity, so why would you tell me these things?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he spoke these words, he was also carefully thinking, trying to assess if what she said was real or fake. Was this a threat to purposely stall for time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moonlight disappeared, and the dark clouds in the sky became more dense. They surrounded the imperial capital, covering the world in a blanket of darkness. The bridal chamber darkened as well, because the candles had already been put out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Shi Hao’s eyes shone with deep radiance, so he could still see everything clearly. The snow white body next to him appeared more and more misty, sparkling, and beautiful.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“She is herself, and I am myself. When the two divine cores were split up, there is no way the two of us are still of one opinion. At the very least, we are still different before returning together,” Yue Chan said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No matter what, the two of you are still one person, so how can you betray your main body? Wouldn’t you use this to truly throw me off?” Shi Hao sneered and didn’t believe her at all. In addition, he mischievously played around with her sparkling ear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">pa</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;sound, Yue Chan slapped his hand away. Two red blushes emerged on her beautiful face along with annoyance and humiliation. She truly wanted to cut his hand off.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was the Heaven Mending Sect’s fairy, and even in the higher realms, she was extremely respected. Her background was astonishing, and she wasn’t someone that could be blasphemed against. However, just now, her ear was actually played with and twisted about. It was just too hateful.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao laughed and didn’t seem to mind her actions. He said, “If that’s all you had, you still aren’t being persuasive enough…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I fear that she might come to kill me.” Yue Chan spoke this sentence.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Even if she comes to kill, she would still kill me first. How could she deal with you first? Saving you seems to make more sense.” Shi Hao revealed a surprised expression. He began to silently think inwardly. A few thoughts emerged in his head, and he didn’t consider these words to be completely empty.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If she fails to kill you, she will most likely try to kill me. After that, all of the issues will be solved,” Yue Chan said. Her eyes flickered with an extremely dazzling radiance, and her body was tightened to a rather tense state.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The main body and second body were both true bodies of flesh and divine cores. As long as one of them is alive, they could rely on the other one to form a perfect divine body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was on the premise that one of the two had to die. Otherwise, there was no way to make a third immortal body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Relax, there’s no need to worry. She won’t appear, nor will she just so happen to come today. Even if we were to assume everything you said was true and she did have these types of thoughts, she would still try to deal with me first. You are my wife, so I will properly protect you.” Shi Hao teased.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In addition, he acted extremely warm hearted, using his hands to comfort her and moving them across her snow white skin. In the end, Yue Chan became even more nervous, and her body became taut, almost as if she was a block of fine jade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sigh</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">, I truly am defeated. I am together with my wife in the bridal room, yet she always acts as if she is facing a poisonous snake. You are purposely attacking me psychologically, right? With me being such a heaven warping divine talent, how could you show this kind of reaction?” Shi Hao pretended to be depressed, and with a&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">pa</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;sound, he gave her snow white and full chest a slap to express his discontent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Did you even hear what I said?” A layer of redness emerged on Yue Chan’s charming face, and there was even more anger. She was being humiliated again and again, yet she couldn’t turn the situation around, causing her to inwardly fume with rage.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am listening, so just speak. It is best if you say everything in one go, because even though the night is long, if we delay our first lovely moment together, it is also a type of squandering of life.” Shi Hao spoke in a relaxed manner.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, a wave of pounding surged to his head, making his body just as tense as Yue Chan’s. His eyes released brilliant divine light, and they were like two brilliant lights as they illuminated the entire palace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yue Chan was startled. The little Stone’s current appearance was incomparably valiant, as if he was a young war deity. His entire body was releasing golden light, making him appear powerful and astonishing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The next moment, Shi Hao already leapt up like a spiritual cat. He landed by the window side and faced the night wind. His head of black hair scattered behind him as he gazed into the heavens. “Is it going to rain?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dark clouds pressed lower and lower, giving others a suffocating feeling and making them feel as if they were being inwardly oppressed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hong!</span></p>

Fluctuations of energy rippled outwards with astonishing divine might.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao’s pupils rapidly shrunk as he stared into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This streak of lightning was extremely strange. It didn’t hack about horizontally, nor did it draw out an arc, instead directly falling down. The beam of light connected into the heavens. It was resplendent and shocking to the extreme.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Inside the imperial palace, a few powerful guards seemed to have sensed something. They raised their heads, but they had never seen such strange lightning before. Why did it descend completely vertically?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s a falling star!” Someone cried out loudly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The peaceful night was broken by this shout. Many people awoke from their stupor, and all of the guards looked as if they were facing a great enemy. This was an unfathomable stage of natural disaster!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Seems like it was going to rain, only, it is a meteor shower!” Shi Hao’s gaze was intense as he stared into the night sky.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The speed these meteorites dropped from the dark clouds at was just too fast. The lights they emitted were like rainbows as they extended out behind them. The power they displayed was too astonishing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When facing this type of natural disaster, forget about an Imperial Palace, even an enormous city would be destroyed and be turned into ruins. Even an area of the great earth would cave in and be ruined.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was too concentrated! Meteorites fell streak after streak, their radiance lighting up the skies and connecting heaven and earth. It was an utterly magnificent sight!</span></p>

This was naturally not the anger of heaven and earth, but instead controlled by someone. It truly was terrifying, enough to leave even supreme experts trembling in fear!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was clearly the might of the heavens, yet it was under the control of a single creature. It was enough to shock the entire world. This type of murderous disaster was enough to obliterate endless creatures.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“She… really did come!” Yue Chan stood up. She didn’t have to the time to worry about her appearance right now, and as such large amounts of her snow white skin was revealed. She moved towards the window and gazed into the sky. Her eyes flickered with radiance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Doesn’t that mean that you were just barely trying to get by before and didn’t know if she will definitely come?” Shi Hao turned around and looked at her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yue Chan’s pupils shone with specks of divine radiance that continuously changed irregularly. She revealed countless expressions, and it was unknown what she was thinking. She seemed to be a bit lost in her thoughts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her cold flesh and jade-like bones, under the sparkling white splendor of this ‘lightning’, looked like the most perfect work of art. She was perfect to the extent where there wasn’t the slightest blemish.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You were trying to stall for time just now, so you should be punished,” Shi Hao said. He then pulled over the long and slender jade body and pressed down on her bright red lips.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yue Chan was startled awake. Her beautiful eyes revealed shock, franticness, and even more shock. Even though the situation had already reached this level, he was still so calm, daring to act like this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll slowly punish you later!” Shi Hao said. He held her wonderful small waist tightly without letting go to prevent her from really breaking free tonight. At this moment, they both watched the meteor shower.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such a terrifying natural disaster hadn’t happened for so many years, and they were all gathered towards the imperial palace. Meteors descended like a great rain, covering the world with dazzling radiance as they poured down.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even divine formations would be torn through, right? Yue Chan was feeling apprehensive. Even though enough preparations had been made before this ‘natural disaster’, the boundless divine might was just impossible to defend against.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The imperial palace was in chaos. Countless cries of alarm rose and fell. Everyone felt as if judgment day had come. This scene was just too terrifying.</span></p>

It smashed into the sky overhead the imposing heavenly palace and erupted with dazzling divine splendor. The enormous shockwaves it produced were incomparably terrifying.&nbsp;</span></p>

Even their heart rates were so fast they were about to stop beating.&nbsp;</span></p>

It was absolutely work-shaking. However, before the meteors made contact with the heavenly palace, they immediately exploded. All types of radiance erupted and scattered in all directions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The earth quaked and the mountains shook. Divine splendor scattered outwards endlessly, submerging this place with dazzling radiance. The entire imperial palace was trembling.&nbsp;</span></p>

It was as if an enormous magical artifact was reviving. Engraved on their surfaces were imprints that had existed for endless years, and there were even more formation patterns.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The meteors descended like a waterfall, as if they were going to wipe out this world. They were incomparably grand and continuously descended from the pitch-black clouds. Boundless streaks of radiance descended streak after streak, connecting into the heavens as they smashed downwards.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This type of divine might was simply not something the power of mortals could contend with. If they were truly trapped within, even supreme experts would be turned into ashes.&nbsp;</span></p>

The great stars exploded in midair one after another and turned into resplendent radiance.&nbsp;</span></p>

Even though the heavenly might was terrifying and enough to wipe out many enormous cities from the face of the great earth, they were still blocked by the ancient formations.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the streaks of heaven connecting beams of light landed above the palaces, they all exploded. Not a single one was able to break through.&nbsp;</span></p>

His gaze was intense. If he had not immediately made use of the large amounts of divine materials he obtained from Immortal Mountain after returning from the mysterious region and had the divine striking stone lay down several divine formations, this imperial palace might have actually been breached.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The heavenly might was endless.

His gaze was like lightning as it pierced through the rain of meteors, releasing two shocking beams of light. He saw the figure inside the clouds. Her divine appearance was covered by hazy radiance. She was otherworldly and extraordinary, as if she was a deity that was god currently overlooking the boundless great earth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was a type of divine aura to her that was even more prevalent and more powerful than Yue Chan’s.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her real appearance couldn’t be seen. Her body was wrapped within radiance. At this moment, she peered down as well and overlooked Shi Hao. Her eyes revealed specks of radiance, but there wasn’t the slightest fluctuation of expression within them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao knew that if the main body and second body were close enough, they could communicate and become one.&nbsp;</span></p>

He revealed a splendid smile, and then he turned his head to cover the bright red lips of the fairy beside him.&nbsp;</span></p>

Intense fluctuations of energy began to ripple outwards.&nbsp;</span></p>
