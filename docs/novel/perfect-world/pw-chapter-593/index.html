Only, they looked a bit bleak. Shi Hao’s chest blasted open. He had a smile on his face and he looked calm, but deep down, he felt quite sad.&nbsp;</span></p>

Meanwhile, his chest bone ruptured, and after blasting apart, a terrifying, heaven collapsing aura erupted!&nbsp;</span></p>

The bronze immortal palace’s void image was blasted through, becoming dim and indistinct.&nbsp;</span></p>

His face was as pale white as snow. This was the first time he felt such fear. He was truly terrified, feeling as if judgment day was descending. Even his heart was trembling.&nbsp;</span></p>

All of his body’s vital energy was ignited, turning into the most foundational energy to support the bronze immortal palace in an attempt to help it solidify and reemerge.&nbsp;</span></p>

It displayed its power once again, once again projecting itself into the lower realm.&nbsp;</span></p>

His chest sounded again, and the other bones had long ruptured. His supreme being bone was the only one that had only a bit of damage. It was just too firm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This powerful bone had long taken form. It was difficult for external force to destroy it. Only if he wished to destroy it himself would it break apart. Finally… it exploded within his body.&nbsp;</span></p>

His face lacked color, and even his soul was trembling. The supreme being bone completely exploded and flew outwards!</span></p>

It suppressed everything. A little figure sat on top of the shattered supreme being bone. It turned around and gave Shi hao a look, and then it rushed forward!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was Shi Hao’s dao, the natural laws produced innnately within his body. Now, it completely exploded without any chance of going back. It became a light of eradication that could destroy all living things.&nbsp;</span></p>

It quickly broke down in this world, releasing waves of trembling sounds. It quickly grew dim, and then it scattered away, disappearing into nothingness.&nbsp;</span></p>

His face was filled with fear. Who wasn’t scared of death? Who could confront this face to face calmly? When the end came, many people would feel fear and reluctance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Immortal Palace’s old servant came to the lower realm with great ambitions. He originally wanted to start a great campaign to unify the eight regions. He was going to find all of the legendary natural opportunities and rise to greatness from them!</span></p>

He wanted to truly break through the shackles of life and step into a road that belonged to himself!</span></p>

The moment that supreme being bone exploded, his dreams in the lower realm shattered, and his life had reached its end.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am unwilling to accept this!” He felt anger, fear, hesitation, grievance, and helplessness, but it was all useless. There was no way for him to defend against this power.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chi!</span></p>

A bloody hole was smashed apart. His flesh quickly broke apart. The boundless energy swept over, almost blasting him apart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that final moment, Huang Yu absent-mindedly saw a youth’s body break apart into several pieces. However, his face still carried a peaceful smile. The corners of his lips were stained with blood. He was staring at Huang Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huang Yu felt great regret. It was precisely him who forced this youth into such a desperate situation, ultimately forcing him to throw his own life away either, making him feel this plight with no way out, this hopeless despair, sending him into a bottomless abyss.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No! I really don’t want to die!” He screamed. His face was deathly pale and warped. He struggled with all of his power, but it was too difficult to struggle free. There was no way.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The supreme being bone exploded. Endless energy surged over, smashing down like a wave. It slammed Huang Yu onto the ground, making his body split apart into pieces and erasing his life force.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huang Yu screamed miserably with terror and fear. He did everything he could to reach out and claw at the void, wishing for time to go back in reverse so that he could escape this terrifying situation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pu!</span></p>

His head was completely blasted apart, shattered into pieces. Then, it began to burn!</span></p>

It truly is a pitiful end.” He released a low cry. Then, he activated a piece of green copper rust within his primordial spirit, and with a cold voice, he shouted, “With the bronze palace’s piece of rust, form the flower of a curse. Blossom for me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was full of bitter resentment. Even though there was only a broken divine consciousness remaining, he still activated this life taking great technique, because he feared that Shi Hao might end up surviving through a fluke.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pu!</span></p>

His flesh and primordial spirit both exploded, turning into ashes. Nothing remained.&nbsp;</span></p>

His body had long been blasted apart. His chest was completely missing. The area above his chest was in one piece, while everything below was in another.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then, under the terrifying fluctuations and light of destruction, he split up into pieces. Every part of his body began to crumble apart. His bones shattered and his flesh burst forth, sending scorching pain towards his entire body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He wasn’t any better off than Huang Yu. What he was currently experiencing was a tearing apart of his own body, a self-destruction, a total disintegration of his physical body.&nbsp;</span></p>

Flesh flew in all directions. The scene was extremely miserable. Shi Hao was on the verge of forever disappearing from this world.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even his skull was cracking apart. Blood flowed out from the space between his brows. His primordial spirit became dim, about to fall apart!</span></p>

Losing all imprints was the same as completely erasing one’s life from this world.&nbsp;</span></p>

Many things emerged in his mind, flying past one after another as if they had just happened yesterday. Memories that were emotional, sad, helpless, joyous… there were just too many, leaving him feeling full of reluctance.&nbsp;</span></p>

His small body dripped with blood, curling up alone on the ice cold bed. He asked his aunt again and again, why did she do this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soon after, he went to Stone Village, slowly growing up in a naive and innocent manner. Finally, he went into the great wastelands alone to start on his own journey.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hundred Shattering Mountains, Northern Sea Kun Peng Nest, Stone Capital’s great battle, battle between two Stones, he walked here step by step, ultimately rising to great power!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The little Stone’s name resounded through the world under the heavens. Who in the present world didn’t know about him? Who hadn’t heard of him yet?</span></p>

He killed seven deities, unfortunately… he was going to fall as well in the end.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The area between Shi Hao’s brows cracked apart. Piece after piece of bone exploded. They were going to fall off and fly away.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His heart was full of anxiousness. He looked at this world, feeling a longing and great reluctance. He softly said, “After walking out from Stone Village, I haven’t been with my parents for that long. I truly wish to see them one more time…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only, he knew that he wouldn’t have this chance. He was going to disappear from this world.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Time seemed to have frozen in place. The little Stone was waiting, watching as he walked down the path of death, falling into eternal darkness. His eyes carried tears as well as a mournful expression.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was because at this final moment, he wasn’t able to meet anyone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was just like in the past, just like when he was little, lying alone on that little bed. Blood dripped out from his chest. There was no warmth, no loved ones to protect him. There was only coldness as he waited for death alone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He withered away alone, sad and dejected. He felt just as helpless as in the past. He felt a type of coldness and loss, and even more sorrow.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why haven’t I died yet?” Shi Hao said softly. He was watching himself die, sending himself out of this world and into an eternal sleep.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, for some reason, time seemed to have stopped for an incomparably long time. After his skull cracked, it didn’t blast apart in all directions. His mind was still clear.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is this?” He saw a green light.&nbsp;</span></p>

It repaired the cracks in his skull and made time seemingly freeze.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A green branch carrying beads of sparkling buds released a gentle radiance. It was precisely this branch that was reuniting all of his flesh and bone fragments, and then reorganizing them.&nbsp;</span></p>

At this final moment, he felt a bit lonely and sad. He thought that he was going to leave this world alone without anyone knowing about it and never expected to sense a familiar aura.&nbsp;</span></p>

If there was any danger, he could call on it, only, he never used it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, now that the Willow Deity left through the Primordial Gate, this branch lost its effectiveness. He couldn’t use it to call the Willow Deity anymore.&nbsp;</span></p>

It was because the Willow Deity left this world, cutting off its connection with it.&nbsp;</span></p>

Today, he sacrificed his own body, and then blasted apart the supreme being bone. It was a death with no chance of life, but he never expected that at the crucial moment, this branch would revive and radiate sparkling green light, guiding his flesh and bone back.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The willow branch shone. Soft buds once again bloomed with life force one after another. They then separated from the branch, and while carrying specks of ripples, they entered Shi Hao’s broken body and connected his shattered flesh.&nbsp;</span></p>

It carried out a revival that restored his vitality.&nbsp;</span></p>

After shattering, it was then pieced together and had its former appearance restored. Only, there were cracks all over his body!</span></p>

A portion had been burned in that terrifying storm of energy. This was the damaged remains.&nbsp;</span></p>
