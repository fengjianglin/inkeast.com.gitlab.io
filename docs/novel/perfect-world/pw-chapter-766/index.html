This path was extremely difficult, and those that had treaded on it since the ancient past had practically all died, vanishing from this world following their defeat.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was unwilling to stop here and wished to take that crucial step to step onto a path different from everyone else. He wished to experience the scenery of a different world!</span></p>

The chances of dying are high, far greater than the gleam of hope, to the extent where it can be said to be a path to death.” Qi Daolin calmly reminded.</span></p>

If he insisted on continuing on, he would most likely end up like those before him, recording his defeat with blood.&nbsp;</span></p>

If I slowly fumble around, I will find a different path.” Shi Hao said to himself. He then stared at Qi Daolin, earnestly inquiring about this about this type of path the ancient people took.</span></p>

When he saw that Shi Hao was calm and at peace, not doing this out of impetuousness, he ultimately nodded and said, “It seems like I have to start looking for another disciple.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao was a bit speechless.

These were all ancient books left behind by predecessors.&nbsp;</span></p>

Bone books piled up to a small mountain, with piece after piece of bone everywhere. Some were golden, some silvery white, some carrying purple energy… none of them were ordinary objects. They created an auspicious image.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were bone pieces that gave off a feeling of the true self, extremely old-fashioned without a bit of luster. They carried an extremely ancient aura, and recorded within were the experiences and paths of noteworthy individuals of the past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao picked up a random piece from the bone books and carefully read it. He was immediately drawn in.&nbsp;</span></p>

This was an ancient being from the Beast sea region, and there was a great irregular phenomenon during its birth. He continued reading, and he learned that this individual was unordinary after all.</span></p>

At nineteen years of age, he rose out from the sea and suppressed the exceptional talents of all three thousand provinces, becoming number one under heaven. Afterwards, he abandoned ancient flames and chose to seek other paths of dao, passing away as a result.”</span></p>

Unfortunately, for the sake of treading on a different path, he ultimately passed away.&nbsp;</span></p>

He carefully studied these records.&nbsp;</span></p>

Normally speaking, these were taboo books, because it would mislead geniuses of later generations.&nbsp;</span></p>

He carefully thought and contemplated on what to do, analyzing the good and bad of Kun Yu’s path.</span></p>

He found it difficult to calm down. This was another formidable figure.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Firegold calendar, year one million two hundred forty-three thousand two hundred ninety-one, five emperors illuminated the heavens, but when they were past their prime, Huo Jinmo emerged…”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the past, Firegold Race was one of the ten great clans, known as an Emperor Clan. It previously had five emperors that simultaneously controlled that era. When the five emperors were nearing the end of their lives, they wanted to advance their heaven warping genius Huo Jinmo’s unmatched legend to an even higher realm, but they ultimately failed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Five emperors invited an old friend to condense the dao as flames and forge a spirit tablet for Huo Jinmo. However, the dao seed ultimately resulted in failure, and the Emperor Clan became no more. With the rise and fall of the world, the Firegold precious vase imprint no longer resounded through the world.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao sighed. It truly was a pity.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He quickly looked around, discovering that the other bone books were similar, all of them paths that predecessors took and later recorded. These were the most precious experiences, able to be considered secret texts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These bone books’ value were difficult to assess. If they ended up in the hands of creatures of the present world, they would definitely be considered secret historical texts. However, when someone like him saw them, these were heavenly precious books!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“These things…” Shi Hao raised his head to look towards Qi Daolin. It was difficult for a single person to have so many, because they touched upon the secrets of a few great sects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“All things I stole.” Qi Daolin was extremely calm, to the point where there was a bit of pride.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao was speechless. He had no choice but to feel admiration. No wonder this person was surrounded and attacked by many sects, just these bone books alone he collected formed a huge pile. One could only imagine regarding the other precious techniques.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One could only say that this dao master was an ‘eccentric’. He felt no qualms about his notorious reputation; this really was quite formidable.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, Shi Hao wouldn't show him disdain, instead only having admiration. Perhaps in the eyes of those of the outside world, the two were birds of a feather.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are not the only genius in this world. Too many have wished to step on different paths. This old one was one of them.” Qi Daolin said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was clear to see that he had failed. Fortunately, he didn’t die like a few young supreme beings and managed to live.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He bluntly spoke about how he walked quite far along that route. After deducing the clear result, he decisively gave up, not foolishly struggling with his life on the line.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Outstanding talents, this term has some meaning, but there are also things that it does not mean. If one knows that they will inevitably die but still heads for destruction, that is stupidity.” Qi Daolin said, not feeling ashamed of his own retreat at all, instead believing it to be honorable.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao knew that he had good intentions. This was to warn him not to walk down a black road, to stop before going too far.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, this path was too difficult, one that no one had succeeded in before. It was a place where heavenly talents often ended their journeys.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I know!” Shi Hao nodded. In the end, he wholeheartedly immersed himself in these bone books to understand the paths and methods of those before him, amassing experience.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the cornerstone, as well as the soil for success. Only with the experiences accumulated through those of the past, seizing the fiery light of wisdom. would there be a chance of success.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one could baselessly break through. Building a cart behind closed doors would never work.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The outside world was definitely not calm, especially Fire Province’s divine mine region. However, it was completely unrelated to Shi Hao. He immersed himself in a brilliant world to seek his dao path.&nbsp;</span></p>

He neglected sleep and food as he wholeheartedly immersed himself in his studies.&nbsp;</span></p>

He began to silently contemplate and think things through.&nbsp;</span></p>

He began to discuss with Qi Daolin, but even with divine objects, heaven and earth placenta, the probability of failure was still great to the point of making one sigh.</span></p>

It was wrapped within source energy, continuously being nurtured by heaven and earth as it absorbed all types of natural laws.&nbsp;</span></p>

The best place to connect it to was precisely the space between the brows.&nbsp;</span></p>

It was because the source energy’s weight would change from time to time. The sudden changes almost made his forehead bone split apart, because it became heavy, with a single strand able to crush a mountain peak.</span></p>

The Kun Peng technique, Lightning Emperor’s technique, and others appeared together, operating together to surround this object, making it calm down and isolating it.&nbsp;</span></p>

It wasn’t that I didn’t want to pass it down to you before, instead fearing that you would be injured from it as a result. It is because at this cultivation realm, there is simply no way for you to display it.”</span></p>

If he wanted to learn this technique, he had to reach an extremely high cultivation realm. The flesh, bone texts, spirit, and others must harmonize to an indistinguishable degree.</span></p>

It can sharpen your precious techniques and other things.” Qi Daolin said with a smile.</span></p>

The pressure this formed forced him to operate the Eight ninth heavens art’s rough method from time to time, spurring on several precious techniques and releasing bone texts. This was a type of cultivation as well.&nbsp;</span></p>

It was immensely beneficial towards his foundational spirit. Even though he didn’t substitute himself in the Immortal gold’s place and immerse himself in the placenta, he could still observe the dao and study it.&nbsp;</span></p>

With a single look, he could get a rough idea of what was going on. His eyebrows immediately jumped, revealing a look of shock. “Could it be the Golden Bodhi fruit?

It was just that it had never been written down in bone books.&nbsp;</span></p>
