It is massive and full of mysteries.” An imperial guard reported.&nbsp;</span></p>

Just now, there were some people who used this to flee.&nbsp;</span></p>

That’s fine, let’s go as well, use this information to head to our next destination!” Shi Hao said. He immediately began to activate it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The bugle horn sounded. The lazurite warship was started up, and then the entire ship released a hazy radiance, departing from this super transport formation. They quickly entered another great region.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Space region was extremely vast. There were many people here. The mountain and rivers were beautiful with inheritances and sects existing in large numbers here. The one that was the most famous here was naturally the Heaven Mending Sect. It had existed since ancient times and had an illustrious history. It was known as an undying sect.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The lazurite warship moved through the void, arriving near Heaven Mending Sect. From time to time, white mists would rise in front of them. Auspicious light blossomed. The mountain peaks that appeared one after another were all covered in mist.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Apart from this, there were even a few islands floating in the sky. Clouds and multicolored light swirled about them. Silver waterfalls showered down from above, carrying a holy aura with them. It was as if they had entered a wonderland.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So this is Heaven Mending Sect! Indeed unordinary!” Everyone from Stone Country sighed in astonishment.&nbsp;</span></p>

Intense fluctuations rippled outwards, surging like a stream. Thunderous rumbling sounds rang through the air as the earth quaked and mountains shook.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A True Phoenix took to the air. Its entire body was covered in brilliant feathers. It danced about in the air, carrying with it powerful divine might as it continuously attacked Heaven Mending Sect’s mountain gate.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Mountain rocks flew about chaotically. Many symbols flickered about. The great mountain protecting formation shone. Many experts were fighting there, as if they were facing a great enemy. They all hid inside while carrying out a defense.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was, of course, Shi Hao’s spiritual body that was sent ahead of time to lock this place down, preventing Heaven Mending Sect’s supreme experts from fleeing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The mountain gate had already been damaged. If not for the divine level formations protecting this place, it would have been broken through a long time ago. This place possessed powerful might with bone text interweaving about. They continuously surged out from within the mountain gate.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So powerful!” Everyone from Stone Country was dazzled as they watched this. Shi Hao’s power alone forced an undying inheritance to fight behind their gate. This type of bombardment was truly incredible.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it was an ordinary person, they would have been chased away a long time ago. They would have long been killed!</span></p>

It was several thousand zhang in length and incomparably terrifying as it hacked towards the True Phoenix!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The True Phoenix covered the sky. It quickly avoided this attack, not deciding to face it head on. A supreme expert with a divine magical artifact was currently fighting against it, displaying astonishing might.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone felt inwardly fearful. So it turned out to be like this! If not for this ancient treasure stopping him, Shi Hao’s spiritual body might have already slaughtered into the mountain gate.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A phoenix cry tore through the air. Tens of thousands of streaks of multicolored lights shot out. It circled about in the air before quickly flying towards the lazurite warship. In the blink of an eye, it entered one of the true Shi Hao’s heavenly passages.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The lazurite warship closed in. Heaven Mending Sect’s people all frowned, feeling as if something was off. They already knew what was going on. Just now, a few people from Immortal Mountain fled here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You really are… Shi Hao?” A shout sounded from within.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The enormous warship stopped. Blue-green light flickered about. Shi Hao stood at the head of the ship while overlooking the world below. He revealed his true body, immediately raising cries of alarm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their reactions were just like Immortal Mountain’s. There wasn’t a single cultivator from Heaven Mending Sect whose expression didn’t change. They were all incomparably shaken. They unexpectedly met the little Stone again!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was definitely a disaster. Back then, they still didn’t believe that the True Phoenix was his spiritual body, but now, it was obvious.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You all threatened my Stone Country, saying that if we didn’t hand the void furnace over to you, there would be a blood tragedy?” Shi Hao calmly said, his voice containing neither joy nor worry.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone’s expressions changed. This time, they truly kicked a metal board. They wanted to obtain the void furnace, so they carried out a threat. Who would have expected that Shi Hao would revive and come back at this time?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This matter will end here. Things have been exposed already.” This voice sounded from Heaven Mending Sect. They wanted to make peace talks.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Giving up? Exposed?” Shi Hao’s voice was calm, but he was shaking his head. Back then, there were supreme experts from this sect who tried to kill him, and this time, they even wanted to deal with Stone Country. He wanted to wipe this place out, not willing to accept this conclusion.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The War King then spoke. “Didn’t you all say that something ominous would happen in Stone Country, that there will be a blood tragedy? Today, we came to welcome the tragedy!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The expressions of everyone from the Heaven Mending Sect became ugly. The other party had already reached their doors, so this battle was definitely unavoidable. The most horrifying thing was that Shi Hao returned, leaving them feeling extremely uneasy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What a little Stone! The entire world thought you were dead. None of us expected to see you again in this world. What a pity! Now, heaven and earth have been truly severed, so we cannot make a report to the higher realm...” Everyone from Heaven Mending Sect felt that it was regretful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, even if they contacted the higher realms, it would be pointless. No deities could come down, so doing this would only make those from the higher realms go mad. A small cultivator ruined their great plans, yet they couldn’t even deal with him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shi Hao, what a pity. You cannot go up either, because the heavenly paths have been severed.” A supreme expert from the Heaven Mending Sect said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There is no need for your concern. Do you want to open the mountain gates yourself, or do you want to wait until I slaughter my way in?” Shi Hao coldly spoke. Even though he wasn’t old, there was a great imposing aura to his figure.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When these domineering words were spoken, the thousands of youngsters from Stone Clan were all moved. Meanwhile, Heaven Mending Sect’s people’s faces became extremely unsightly, feeling that he was too overbearing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If you have the ability, then attack your way in. However, if you fail, we will inevitably pay a visit to Stone Country!” Heaven Mending Sect’s uncompromising group shouted. They were extremely unwilling to accept this result. Since the ancient times, who dared to attack them? They all felt furious!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fine! I will slaughter my way in and show all of you!” Shi Hao said. He walked out from the lazurite warship and walked on the void. He arrived in front of the mountain gate.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chi!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Inside Heaven Mending Sect, a streak of incomparably terrifying sword energy appeared. This was released from a true deity magical artifact, one that was ten thousand zhang in length. It immediately shot over to kill Shi Hao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao remained completely fearless. He raised his hand, summoning a small silver cauldron. It began to swirl about, and then it devoured the sword energy, neutralizing all of it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Go!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He released a light shout, sending the little cauldron smashing towards the mountain gate. Heaven overflowing divine radiance erupted. This place exploded into pieces.&nbsp;</span></p>
