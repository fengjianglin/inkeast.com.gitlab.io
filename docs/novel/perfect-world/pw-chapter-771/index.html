It had Flood dragon blood, Hou soul, and a horse body. It was exceptionally powerful and currently at the Supreme Expert Realm. It was far more powerful than many so-called elites.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yu Lun pulled on the reins and looked backwards.</span></p>

They all revealed looks of jealousy, This mount was too extraordinary, being more powerful than quite a few of the people here.&nbsp;</span></p>

The trees were ancient, and a few demonic birds were spreading their wings, covering the sky like dark clouds. There were a few vicious beasts who were like small mountains, and they were roaring towards the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, none of these creatures posed the people here any threat.

It’s right here.” Someone pointed forward. The mountain region was vast. Mountains towered imposingly and majestically.&nbsp;</span></p>

He looked at this mountain region. If it was cleaned up, it would be a spiritual earth as well. However, currently, it was too desolate.</span></p>

Old vines and ancient trees blocked the path. Thistles and thorns could be found throughout. However, the grand mountains ahead still released strands of auspicious radiance, proving that this place was unordinary.&nbsp;</span></p>

A streak of blazing radiance erupted. A Heavenart halberd refined from the bones of a Flood dragon. Its spotlessly white body carried traces of faint gold, and a strange aura was exuding from it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What a powerful aura and shocking fluctuations! This definitely startled that ‘great senior brother’ in the mountains. This was a challenge!&nbsp;</span></p>

His eyes opened, and he took steps outwards, gazing below the mountain. His eyes were calm without any happiness or worry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was less than eighteen years old currently. His body was tall and slender, and black hair scattered down his shoulders. His appearance was delicate and pretty, his eyes shining as he stood there. There wasn’t the slightest bit of killing energy or intimidating pressure.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Below, everyone saw him. Quite a few individuals cried out in alarm.</span></p>

Supreme Being Dao Rite’s great martial brother. He is just a single person, yet he doesn’t fear great battles. He has yet to be defeated.”</span></p>

They all felt like they were in luck, because the great battle hadn’t started yet. They finally didn’t miss a great battle, looking forward to witnessing it personally.&nbsp;</span></p>

There were outstanding talents that came from Oblique Moon Ancient Cave, Divine Cliff Academy, and other places. They all came to get in on the action, coming here to spectate the battle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I believe that this will likely be an evenly matched great battle. One of the Celestial Clan’s six heroes, Yu Lun’s name is well known. He is just too famous. As for the great martial brother, he is quite unusual as well, hard to see through.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Aren’t you rating that ‘great senior brother’ a bit too highly? The Celestial Clan is known to be an Emperor Clan, while Yu Lun is one of their best, much stronger than Kun Mo. Will he even use up much energy to win?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">More and more people gathered below the mountains, crowding this place.

After all, the Celestial Clan were previously an emperor clan, and Yu Lun was representing that clan to fight. Regardless of which disciple it was here, none of them wanted to miss out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are that lunatic?” Yu Lun raised the Heavenart halberd alone, pointing it towards the mountain top. He wore silver battle clothes, the metallic luster shining and releasing auspicious multicolored radiance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It had to be said that he really was handsome. His head of purple hair fell down, his skin fine white like jade. His sharp eyebrows were pointing downwards, his starry eyes brilliant. His appearance really was exceptional.</span></p>

The powerful fluctuations he releases alone are enough to prove his exceptional cultivation. Worthy of being one of an Emperor Clan’s six heroes!”</span></p>

He was too calm, standing there and looking downwards. His eyes were deep, as if he had already transcended.</span></p>

How could he look so handsome and outstanding, exuding a type of elegant bearing?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the first time many of them saw Shi Hao, especially those female students. They all felt shocked; this was the despicable ‘great senior brother’ that was being talked about recently?</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao continued to look downwards. With a calm voice, he replied, “If you want to challenge me, then just come up.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You think you are someone deserving of a challenge? I came here to take your head! There are already people warming up the wine, so after taking your head, I will go back to drink!” Yu Lun said. His voice was thunderous, resounding through this mountain region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How imposing! There is a type of ancient heroic bearing!” A few people sighed in admiration. This type of confidence and great spirit made him appear extremely heroic.</span></p>

He stirred on his mount, and while holding the Heavenart halberd, he turned into a streak of white light before rushing up the mountain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Flood dragon beast seemed to be walking on wind. It was extremely strong, able to easily tear apart great mountains and trample ancient peaks. It could enter li fire magma or Nine Underworld Yin Earth as if it was just walking on normal ground.</span></p>
