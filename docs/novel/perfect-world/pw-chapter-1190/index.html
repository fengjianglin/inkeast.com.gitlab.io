The Yuan Family came with an arrogant attitude, demanding to see Shi Hao, incredibly overbearing, yet the result now… was that he got beaten on the spot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just how much time had passed? The changes were just too fast, leaving one speechless, a bit stupefied.</span></p>

A place where one can bully the weak as the strong? Making all that noise, if you all aren’t taught a proper lesson, are you all going to flatten this place, taking this as a place belonging to Yuan Family?” Shi Hao’s lips curled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Peng!</span></p>

Yuan Hong released a miserable scream, his body flying out diagonally, smashing into a several hundred thousand jin giant boulder, and then fell down, blood continuously flowing out from the corners of his mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The change in situation really was too fast. The originally domineering and arrogant Yuan Hong was beaten to this state, unable to resist at all, his bones broken and muscles snapped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hey, can you stop pretending to be dead? Aren’t you here to represent Yuan Qing? Can it be that Yuan Qing really is just this disappointing?” Shi Hao walked up, and then gave him two more kicks, beating Yuan Hong until his eyes rolled back, almost fainting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Having no sense of propriety like this, taking action against me, you won’t be able to live for long!” Yuan Hong said hatefully. He was truly angered badly. His status was extremely high, originating from the Yuan Clan, yet in the end, he was beaten so viciously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For a great expert like him, this really left him too sullen. He was so angry his entire body was shaking, almost fainting.</span></p>

Your Yuan Family has done all those hateful things again and again, yet you still have the nerve to act arrogant here, I’m going to beat you into a pig head!” Shi Hao said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He walked up, lifted Yuan Hong by the collar, and then raised his palm, starting to slap his face. The&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">pilipala</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;sounds were loud and clear, as if bamboo clapper boards were being used.</span></p>

He had never suffered this type of humiliation before! Being beaten by a younger generation like this, it was beyond intolerable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He struggled intensely, his eyes releasing flames, truly wishing to immediately kill Shi Hao. This was polar opposite from his usual immortal dao appearance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pa!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little bastard, you dare to humiliate me like this, you can forget about entering Sacred Academy in this life, and you can give up on going to Immortal Academy either! You won’t ever have the chance to cultivate exceptional methods, just stop here!” Yuan Hong was furious, threatening loudly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who do you think you are, what qualifications do you have to speak in those two academies’ place? Since you insist on being so hard mouthed, then enjoy some more slaps!” Shi Hao said,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">pi pa&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">sounds following without hesitation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Brat, you can show off and boast all you want here, but when you enter the two academies, you’ll wish you were dead rather than alive! All of the experts there will suppress you together, you can’t beg for life or death!” Yuan Hong roared, his eyes filled with bloody wisps.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was truly going crazy from anger, feeling no more reservations, both his arms and legs moving, regardless of whether he had strength at all, only wishing to kill Shi Hao, completely losing all reason.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao didn’t waste any words with him, just continuing to hit him. This time, Yuan Hong’s face fully distorted, the teeth in his mouth falling out one after another, soon after completely fallen out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A glorious sect master level figure was humiliated like this, it really made him feel worse than being killed. His eyes were bright red, his hair standing on end, entire body taut, completely mad.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, there was nothing he could do. Right now, Shi Hao also had sect master level strength, and together with the three strands of immortal energy winding about his body, suppressing him was extremely easy, pressing him down and beating him up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was stupefied. What were these two doing? One was an important individual from the Yuan Clan who had sect master level strength, the other someone who cultivated three strands of immortal energy, a supreme being among his peers, both of their statuses astonishing, but right now, it was as if they were in a marketplace streets, fighting roughly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, this was definitely done intentionally by that youth, the purpose precisely to mock Yuan Hong, lifting him up by his collar and beating him up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This left one between laughter and tears. The two extraordinary individuals were actually tangled about each other like this, one beating the other’s mouth viciously, fists smashing down fiercely, making one feel a bit dizzy from watching.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soon afterwards, Yuan Hong’s face swelled greatly, as if it immediately became much bigger, even his eyes hidden under his swollen face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a sect master, his body was like diamond that had been refined a hundred times over, if one didn’t call it sturdy and unbreaking, then it was definitely not far off. However in the end, if was as if hoodlums were fighting in the markets, his wounds shockingly similar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Humiliating! Truly extraordinary shame!” Yuan Hong didn’t have teeth in his mouth, so his voice was a bit off as he shouted there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you really Yuan Qing’s son? But your performance really is too lacking, not having any strength, truly losing face for your father!” Shi Hao shook his head, commenting. He already let go of his hand, throwing Yuan Hong to the ground, looking down on him from above.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was stunned. Just now, they had almost forgotten Yuan Hong’s identity. That was but Yuan Qing Supreme Being’s own son, his direct line of descent, yet he was beaten up like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Everything has already been said. Your Yuan Family isn’t enough, believing yourselves to be infallible, clearly just a half supreme being, yet you insist on pretending to be a supreme being family. Now, you’ve all been exposed right? Truly deserving to be beaten!” Shi Hao ridiculed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yuan Hong was now exhaling more than he was breathing in, already unable to display any more anger. He laid there, his face fallen, swollen to a ridiculous state, mouth opened as he breathed heavily, truly like a beaten dog.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What else do you still want to say. What did you come here for?” Shi Hao sat on a large rock, asking like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was speechless, this fella really wasn’t some good person. He was previously criticized harshly by Yuan Hong, this person arriving imposingly, but Shi Hao didn’t pay him any attention, and now, he beat the other party into this kind of state, interrogating him instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yuan Hong was so angry the roots of his teeth were going to break from his clenched teeth. Right now, he was laying on the ground, hard to even move. All of the bones in his body were broken, so how was he supposed to criticize and interrogate the other party?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao’s eyes were deep. With a raise of his hand, a streak of sword radiance flickered about between his fingers. He really wanted to cut him down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Throw him out of Heavenly Deity Institution.” Fifth Elder suddenly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao felt some hesitation, but in the end still didn’t deliver the killing blow. It was clear that the academy’s elder didn’t wish for him to be kiledl here, feeling that he was already taken care of enough.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one expected things to get to this extent. In the end, Yuan Hong was dragged behind Shi Hao in an extremely shameful manner and thrown out from Heavenly Deity Institution.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After who knew how much time had passed, only then did Yuan Hong recover a bit of strength. He treated his injured body, teeth clenched, feeling incomparably resentful, angered to the point where his liver was in pain, but there was nothing he could do.</span></p>

This was a type of challenge; was he not scared that Yuan Qing would contact the people he was familiar with from the two academies, make things difficult for Shi Hao?</span></p>

There is enmity between him and Yuan Qing that can’t be dissolved, so instead of lowering his own stance, he might as well act powerfully, who knows, perhaps this might still allow him to draw the attention of a few old freaks from the two academies, from this neutralize Yuan Qing’s various small schemes.”</span></p>

Right now, Shi Hao and a group of people had gathered by a dark blue, gemstone-like small lakeside, facing the moonlight while drinking wine.</span></p>

I heard that this place is quite strange with many ruins of collapsed small worlds, traces of the cosmos being destroyed and absorbed into the realm tombs. Even though we can try to picture the peculiarities of that place based on the descriptions, it is still difficult to imagine what it is like exactly.” Shi Hao said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have heard about the Realm Tomb before too.” The White Qilin young beast said.
