 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This creature’s body was stooped, old to a ridiculous degree. He sat there, revealing a meaningful smile, saying, “Those three experts are not true bodies, only stone engravings.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Changhe, Gu Mingdao, and the others were stupefied, somewhat unable to understand what the elder was saying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior, please explain further. Just what exactly is going on?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Everything has already been said. There are stone engravings on the ancestral altar. Someone offered sacrifices, and that was why heroic spirits appeared.” The aged creature narrowed his eyes, like cracking old bark when he smiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gu Mingdao, Golden Giant, and others all wished to get to the bottom of this, understand why the three unmatched experts protected Shi Hao, or else they just couldn’t find peace inside. When they heard this, all of them felt a bit stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I understand, I previously heard some old matters about the ancestral altar, it was built by True Immortals…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whey they completely understood the truth, these people erupted, so angry their hearts were burning. They were actually scammed, scared witless by some stone engravings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This truly was humiliating. They were all great experts who had already become famous for many years, yet they were fooled by a younger generation, moreover in such a humiliating manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was especially true for Gu Mingdao. When he thought about how he slapped his own mouth, apologizing there, he was so angry his entire body shivered. There was nothing more embarrassing than this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I want to skin them alive!” Gu Mingdao roared in anger, slapping the table and standing up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What do you want to do, who are you skinning? Let me warn you, Ye Qingxian’s origins are extremely great, not someone you can touch!” The elder said with a sunken face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This matter is not finished!” Wang Changhe was also indignant. Wang Family’s five dragons were sent to Desolate Border, this alone leaving them vexed and upset, feel a pent-up wave of anger. Now, they suffered again, so they naturally revealed killing intent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the Golden Giant, Gold Family’s experts, their faces sunk as well. If news of this got out, they would definitely become a laughingstock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior, this matter has been stirred quite big, it cannot be considered a small problem. There is someone who pretended to be unmatched ancient ancestors, they need to be strictly punished! This is especially the case when until now, Stone Clan’s three brothers still didn’t make things clear, admit their faults. They should be punished!” Gu MIngdao said with a cold expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You are correct, all of them needs to be punished severely, sending them out to fight the enemy. Not even the most powerful people dare to promise that they can come back alive, there are ‘Dragonslayers’ there.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It is useless no matter what you say to me!” The elder’s face fell, ending this conversation, sending them out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The group of people got up, not daring to say anything else, leaving after giving their respects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They naturally wouldn’t leave the matter at that, because they lost too much face this time. Quite a few people were crushed to the ground by the three magical projections. When they thought back, this truly was too shameful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These people moved, which naturally also startled some others. After understanding the situation, everyone couldn’t help but laugh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Qingxian’s origins were extremely great, Gu Mingdao and the others didn’t dare touch her. Meanwhile, Huang won over ten kings, so they couldn’t take action either. They were momentarily trapped in an impossible situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We are going for broke. Report to the people inside the ancestral altar that someone tried to impersonate unmatched experts, that there needs to be an explanation!” Gu Mingdao said through clenched teeth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jin Family’s people expressed their agreement, believing that this was feasible. If they startled several unmatched experts who were secluded, they might punish Stone Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are we overestimating ourselves too much? Those types of people will most likely not meet us.” Someone muttered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We don’t necessarily have to meet those people, it is enough as long as we meet their attendants.” Wang Changhe said. He understood the unmatched figures’ situation well, because when he was young, he previously had the luck of being the dao child of Immortal Wang for a few years, serving outside his cave of seclusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ancestral altar was extremely quiet. This group of people arrived, wishing to ‘bring an accusation’, make the unmatched people appear to severely punish the sinner’s bloodline.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“All of you, please go back. The old ancestors are in seclusion, they will not come out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was an old-fashioned ancestral altar that occupied an extremely large amount of space, historical sites appearing continuously. These people were stopped as soon as they approached. After understanding the situation, this was what they were told.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why? Impersonating several unmatched seniors, how could this not be punished?” Gu Mingdao said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is especially the case with the sinner’s blood descendant, someone sacrificed to their ancestors, moreover producing heroic spirits, this is not a small matter!” Wang Changhe added.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“An old ancestor had previously spoken up, but only spoke two words: forget it.” The young cultivator that stopped them said, having them stop and immediately leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Forget it?” Everyone was stunned. It was only these two words, there was too much hidden beneath this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This matter wasn’t something they could continue investigating, but that old ancestor didn’t seem to be too satisfied either. After all, someone interfered, pretending to be an unmatched expert.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">, we can’t produce too much of a disturbance, but we still have to display a type of attitude. That ancient ancestor doesn’t seem to side with the sinner’s bloodline Stone Clan. Interesting, let’s go.” Someone said quietly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The future is long!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They left, eyes flickering with light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, every one of them still carried resentment inside. They were truly angered badly this time, feeling like they were scammed and humiliated by others, yet they couldn’t immediately get revenge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Inside the ancestral altar, Cao Yusheng’s face was bitter, saying, “Even though venting our anger feels good, this group of idiots aren’t going to let things end here, they will start trouble sooner or later.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You definitely won’t die. Just treat this as a type of self sharpening.” Ye Qingxian laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How do you know?” Cao Yusheng looked at her, completely on guard. He was extremely sharp, because his master had previously divinated his fate, seeing a corner of the future!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Because…” Ye Qingxian wanted to say something, but quickly closed her cherry mouth, and then laughed in an extremely lowly manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Accept your sharpening, or perhaps await for your great opportunity to come. When the time comes, I’ll also come to join in the fun.” Ye Qingxian said while blinking her large eyes. She sent them out from the ancestral altar, speaking like this when they were parting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the end, someone came to receive them. However, they were broken up, split up to different tribes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Emperor City was extremely large, like a great world. Mountains, rivers, all living creatures, everything that should be there was there. Shi Hao felt like this place was many times more vast than the lower realms’ eight regions! He was led into a small tribe, great mountains majestic, forests luxuriant, apes crying and tigers roaring, full of a savage feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cao Yusheng was close to him, separated by a river, in a mid-sized tribe on the other side. Comparatively speaking, Shi Yi and Qin Hao were a bit farther, not in this place at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You are surnamed Shi? Why didn’t you temporarily change your surname before coming?” An old man walked out from the small tribe, dressed in a patched beast skin cloth, looking at Shi Hao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is my surname, why do I need to change it?!” Shi Hao asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man released a light sigh, not saying anything else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This small tribe didn’t have many people, only around a thousand. Compared to the massive Emperor City and various clans, it was extremely small and insignificant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon afterwards, Shi Hao understood a few matters, because this small tribe’s surname was precisely ‘Shi’.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“All of you are surnamed Shi?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man nodded, in &nbsp;declining spirits, lacking a type of vitality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You were dispatched here?” A robust man walked over. He wore tattered armor, carrying an extremely heavy war spear, asking like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Those who come here don’t have good endings, they will most likely all fall in battle.” A young man walked over, a mammoth on his back. He just came back after hunting in the great mountains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What do you mean?” Shi Hao asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It is only because we are surnamed Shi, so we cannot become rich and powerful, can only decline. Before, we were one of the greatest powers in this city, but everything changed!” That young man said unwillingly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">According to what he said, in the most ancient era, Stone Clan had many people, experts like clouds, possessing great authority in Imperial Pass. However, an old court case was dug out, and then they became sinner’s blood descendants, the situation immediately changing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ever since then, whenever they went to battle, Stone Clan’s people had to fight at the very front. Countless clansmen died in battle, no matter how many geniuses there were, how many experts, they still couldn’t support such disastrous losses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Later on, geniuses pretty much all withered away!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Generation after generation passed. A great clan declined, blood, bones, and tears shed, too unbearable to recall, just too tragic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now, Stone Clan had less than a thousand people, this still the result of some people cherishing the past, specially protecting them. Otherwise, their clan would have long been wiped out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Shi Hao heard this, he immediately erupted into rage, a wave of hot blood rushing to his head. How could things be like this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Declining to sinner’s blood descendants, the situation here was extremely terrible, even more severe than ‘Sin Province’ in the Three Thousand Dao Provinces. It truly was going too far!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ahwu..</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, crying sounds could be heard from the distance. A few clansmen with Shi as their surnames in tattered beast skin clothes brought back several coffins.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Dad!” The young man who previously carried the mammoth on his back, having just returned from hunting released a miserable howl. He threw aside the giant elephant and threw himself over, loudly crying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How did they die?” Shi Hao asked the elder with a low voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The elder who received him to the tribe released a long sigh, saying, “Naturally died in battle. A’shou’s father was an extremely formidable soldier, as well as the most powerful genius of the Shi surnamed adults. Unfortunately, he was still killed in battle.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whenever this clan produced a powerful expert, they would always immediately be sent out to fight on the battlefield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It could be said that this was the reason why this clan declined, geniuses destined to fall, no way they could live for a long time. They would inevitably be sent out of the pass, lasting until they gave their lives on the battlefield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They bully others too far!” Shi Hao said in anger, his blood almost boiling. A fist smashed through a giant rock to the side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A long, long time ago, there was a group of descendants who were sent out. You are most likely someone of that group, right? Otherwise, you wouldn’t have been sent here immediately after entering Imperial Pass.” The old man said with a sigh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao knew that they were definitely of the same clan, the same ancestor. Otherwise, they would have the same sinner’s blood markings on their foreheads!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This clan, when their emotions were agitated too much, when they got angry, their foreheads would shine, producing an ancient character, producing a mysterious power, sinner’s blood would collapse the clouds!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What flows with us isn’t sinner’s blood, it is brilliance and glory.” Shi Hao said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The elder was given a fright, hurriedly warning, “</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shh</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">, lower your voice, these words cannot be randomly spoken, or else you will bring a great disaster!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I want to see what they can do, how they will deal with me!” Shi Hao said with a cold laugh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This small tribe of Stone Clan already had very few people. Meanwhile, this place also lagged behind, the spiritual essence not great, far inferior to the spiritual mountains of those top clans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao really wanted to know just what kind of great mistake Stone Clan’s ancestors made for them to be targeted like this. He wanted to fully understand this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Due to his meeting with Ye Qingxian being too hurried, he didn’t have time to ask her, which was why he learned about the situation in this small tribe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was someone who revealed a perplexed expression, saying with a sigh, “There was an unmatched expert among our ancestors, previously unrivaled in this world, but that year…”</span></p>
