Some of them were even backing away, because they couldn’t see through the little Stone, feeling that he was too strange. How was he able to lock down three experts that ignited divine flames?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, when his final sentence sounded, a green vine swayed back and forth. It was extremely angry. There was a divine flame throbbing inside of it, yet it was being provoked like this in this realm. It was too hateful.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They naturally could tell that the little Stone’s true cultivation couldn’t fight against the experts here, so exactly what did he rely on? Was there a terrifying supreme treasure on him?</span></p>

They possessed boundless might and were extremely powerful.&nbsp;</span></p>

They decisively turned around and flew towards the horizon to no longer involve themselves and watch the situation first.&nbsp;</span></p>

A sphere of light that was like a purple golden pill flew over. It erupted with resplendent symbols and exploded in midair; it was going to kill Shi Hao here.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was immediately startled and quickly moved out of the way. The Kun Peng technique was used to its limit. After shifting out tens of thousands of zhang outwards, he saw that the purple light there overflowed into the heavens and scattered the clouds in the sky.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What powerful strength! He was greatly shocked inside. Even though it had just lit its divine flame and only begun its divine path, so it wasn’t a true deity yet, its power was similarly terrifying!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That green vine was furious. Green flames immediately overflowed into the heavens. Symbols scattered out from all over its body, taking root in the void to derive divine force. It then erupted with divine might to kill him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lock in place!” Shi Hao shouted. He raised his hand and pointed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was astonished, and they immediately retreated. Even this grave vine shivered inwardly, feeling chilliness inside. It quickly made its way through the sky to avoid beings struck.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yet in the end, nothing happened. No one was locked down in place.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone’s eyes focused on him with flickering expressions. Shi Hao scratched his head, and after putting on a calm expression, he said, “There are accidents sometimes. Again!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He pointed outwards, aiming at the grape vine. He softly uttered the word ‘lock’ again, but once again, there were no changes. It still shocked the divine vine until it dodged thousands of zhang in the air.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lock again!” Shi Hao pointed out. This time, the grape vine didn’t dodge at all and coldly stood in place.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In addition, the other great sects’ powerful individuals that had their divine flames lit were also like this. They suspended high in the air while coldly watching everything.&nbsp;</span></p>

With a forced laugh, he said, “I just learned this technique, so it might still need some more practice. Let me think about bit about how to use it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This joke was a bit cold. Everyone became cold and killing intent pervaded the air. They all slaughtered their way forward.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A black sparrow sneered. A streak of black lightning shot out from its mouth as soon as it opened it. It shot forward with thunderous noise as if it came from dark clouds.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a spirit that followed the Black Gold Sparrow into the lower realm. It wasn’t made from flesh but instead black gold. Even though it had lit its divine flame, it was still far from the Black Gold Sparrow the Willow Deity struck down.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, for Shi Hao, it was a disaster and not a proper opponent to fight. His arms trembled, forming Kun Peng wings and weaving through the skies to avoid this attack. His forehead was covered in cold sweat.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hua la!</span></p>

It was long enough to surround a mountain peak. It wanted to bind Shi Hao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The grape vine had taken action. Green light flickered and symbols filled this place densely. Large amounts of divine flames rippled outwards. For a supreme expert, this was a divine might that simply could not be defended against.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It followed the Sun God Vine down into the lower realm. After that ancient golden vine had a part of it hacked off by the Willow Deity, it directly retreated back to the higher realms and didn’t bring it along.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Green colors overflowed in this area.

Shi Hao quickly rushed into the air, but the mountainous green plants surged upwards, covering the word and submerging him within!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Was this the disparity between them and himself? After igniting the divine flame and heading onto the path of divinity, one could completely look down on supreme expert level cultivators. Their powers were boundless.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Body Locking Talisman!”</span></p>

A yellow talisman seal emerged in his hand. It moved downwards, and ferocious fiery light immediately began to burn.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was shocked, and even the grape vine was shaken. A vine immediately began to burn, inflicting damage upon it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, that was all. That paper talisman burned up and couldn’t truly inflict damage on the grape vine. It could only burn through a few of its leaves.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yue Chan’s main body could see what was happening clearly. Her sparkling charming face carried a faint smile, and her eyes were deep. She naturally recognized that this was something she left behind. When she had been seriously wounded by Shi Hao previously, all of her treasures had been lost.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Multicolored light surged. A group of experts formed spirit bodies before rushing down with extreme speed. There were four individuals that had divine flames lit, and right now, they surrounded Shi Hao. Their expressions were cold and killing intent was surging from their bodies.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Everyone, if you have things to say, we can talk it out. Don’t be so in such a hurry. We are all cultivators here, so why is there a need for something like this? We can sit down and find answers through theory instead of practice.” Shi Hao grumbled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Even a mere Formation Arrangement Realm cultivator like you dares to act so impudently?” Someone said coldly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The grape vine in particular became even more cold. It had been ridiculed by Shi Hao earlier, so its killing intent had long been stirred. Its green divine flame throbbed as it said, “Your innate talent truly isn’t bad, but if you aren’t allowed to grow up, you will never become anything. I want your bone!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We can study and observe this bone together. Everyone, be careful to not have him self-destruct when seizing the bone.” That Black Gold Sparrow spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These were spirit bodies and not true bodies!</span></p>
