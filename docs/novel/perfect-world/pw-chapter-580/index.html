He crossed great mountains one after another in search of an enormous city. Only places like these had altars that could send him to a different place.&nbsp;</span></p>

He suffered serious injuries and continuously coughed out blood, almost dying right there.&nbsp;</span></p>

He stepped on top, and without any hesitation, a golden passageway was opened up and he escaped.</span></p>

After chasing him for such a long time, they still didn’t intercept him. For them, this was a bit of a shameful thing.&nbsp;</span></p>

The other four deities were likely going to make their move as well. If Shi Hao was intercepted by them, then it would be quite a disaster.&nbsp;</span></p>

His speed was fast to the extreme. He used the seventy-two transformations to turn into a Kun Peng, and then he had the help of the earth withdrawal symbol as well. He disappeared into the horizon in the blink of an eye.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His current speed was faster than the three deities’!</span></p>

His aura would still be sensed by them in the end, so as long as he hesitated for a moment to catch his breath, they would immediately catch up.&nbsp;</span></p>

He quickly adjusted his breath to recover his essence energy.&nbsp;</span></p>

They flowed with multicolored light. He threw them into his mouth and swallowed them together with blood.&nbsp;</span></p>

He no longer coughed, and his injured body received nourishment. He continuously shone, and symbols fluctuated about his body. His essence energy was gradually becoming filled again.&nbsp;</span></p>

Otherwise, he might immediately fall due to his energy being lacking.&nbsp;</span></p>

You really are quite daring. No wonder they were cursing you and demanding your death.” The pangolin was the first to arrive. Silver light flickered about. It opened its mouth and spat out a streak of electrical radiance to kill Shi Hao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were clearly quite shocked. Who dared to treat the Demonic Sunflower Garden’s ‘seeds’ as pill medicines? If news of this got out, it would immediately incur crazy retaliation.</span></p>

The little Formation Arrangement Realm thing in front of their eyes truly wasn’t worth expending all this effort. This made them feel embarrassed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, his speed was that fast. When the Kun Peng technique was displayed together with the earth withdrawal technique, not even creatures that lit their divine flames could compare.&nbsp;</span></p>

Otherwise, they really would have lost him.&nbsp;</span></p>

Several dozen li passed in a flash, and with a spreads of his wings, another several hundred li was gone. He arrived in an ancient place where mountains rose and fell, stretching as far as the eye could see.&nbsp;</span></p>

Crazy winds erupted around them, blasting apart the enormous trees along the way. One could see just how astonishing their speeds were!</span></p>

It was built from an enormous rock, and countless bones could be seen scattered on the ground around it. It was exuding heaven overflowing killing energy, leaving all of the experts that ignited their divine flames feeling horrified.&nbsp;</span></p>

He was actually going to make his move before them.&nbsp;</span></p>

He moved to the side of the altar, wanting to make his move, but also hesitating. He seemed extremely nervous.&nbsp;</span></p>

A great fear emerged from the depths of their hearts.&nbsp;</span></p>

His mind was in chaos. He was terrified, feeling an indescribable type of fear. It was something only those that reached this level of cultivation realm could sense.&nbsp;</span></p>

He swept his eyes over the three of them and said, “In this place, you all are the insects. What arrogance? If you want to live, then kneel and kowtow before this altar!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yang Li’s head of silver hair danced about. His expression was ashen. If it wasn’t because he couldn’t act rashly here, he would have long burned Shi Hao directly into ashes.&nbsp;</span></p>

His feet were hardly touching the ground, and his body was taut from fear. He was doing everything he could to fly in reverse. His face was pale without any trace of color.&nbsp;</span></p>
