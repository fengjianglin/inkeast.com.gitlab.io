 <p><strong>Chapter 429</strong><b> - Immortal Mountain’s Decree</b></p>
 <p><span style>A decree flew across the boundless wasteland regions. It was as if it was a deity descending into a world of mortals, bringing with it tens of thousands of streaks of golden light. Characters were imprinted upon it one after another, all of which contained the complex and profound meanings of the great dao. </span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, it descended in Fire Nation Imperial Capital and began to burn like golden flames. Symbols flickered one after another as if they were going to seal up this world. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The Immortal Mountain’s decree travelled through the wall separating domains and entered the wasteland region!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This happened many days ago. News of this extended gradually to every area, creating quite a commotion. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The Immortal Mountain really was powerful. It was just a decree, yet it could pass through the wall separating great regions and travel through the skies. It truly left many people shaken. Even though they knew quite a bit, they still couldn’t understand how it could do such a thing. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have you heard? The Immortal Mountain has sent a decree. It seems like it wants to summon Shi Hao.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Right, things will become extremely difficult for him. This is an undying inheritance we are talking about. After daring to kill this ancient sect’s people, it will be hard for him to preserve his life…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As cultivators moved about, information spread to many cities, sparking quite a few discussions. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Quite a few people heard the rumor that the Immortal Mountain sent a decree into the wasteland region for him to have an audience. This was most likely done to get rid of him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>All types of rumors and suspicions quickly passed around. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The Medicine Capital was hundreds of thousands li away, making it quite far from the Fire Nation Capital. There were endless mountain ranges separating them, but they still heard a few vague rumors. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Hao was half worried and half happy. He was happy that this divine bug was extraordinary, displaying such power even though it had just emerged, so it could help him fight soon. What was worrisome was that this fellow ate too much. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He tried to convince Yun Xi for a long time to help him find an Archaic Divine Mountain that was suitable in raising an Emperor Butterfly larva. In the end, the purple-clothed girl didn’t even take a moment to think before refusing. </span></p>
 <p><span style>She was scared of what could happen. This divine bug was too greedy. If it unknowingly wiped out all of a party’s spiritual medicines, then their Heavenly Divine Mountain would suffer as well. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you implying? Can’t you even show the way? If you don’t tell me, I’ll directly go to your Heavenly Divine Mountain!” Shi Hao said. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you dare, then you can give it a try.” Yun Xi looked forward to him trying. At that time, she’ll directly capture and detain him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I should just forcefully carry you back first.” Shi Hao threatened. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yun Xi’s face became thoroughly red. Right now, she truly couldn’t defeat the devilish child. Back then, the other party could only roll around the ground while wrestling her, but now, he could directly capture her. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop fighting amongst each other. Something major happened!” The big red bird shouted. </span></p>
 <p><span style>It had just went out to wander about and heard a few rumors. The Immortal Mountain had issued a decree to call in the little Stone. There was another saying that they were going to capture and kill the little Stone. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Hao was shocked. This colossus of a power was truly wary of him. They’ve taken action so quickly. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won’t pay attention to it for now.” He shook his head. Right now, there were rumors flying everywhere, so who knew if this was real or fake. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Several days later, news that were relatively reliable came. The Immortal Mountain really did issue a decree for Shi Hao to have an audience. Nothing else was said, so no one knew whether it was good or bad. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Hao was put in a bad mood. So what if it was the Immortal Mountain? Did they think that they could dominate the world, summoning whoever they wanted? He wasn’t going to go. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Several days later, another rumor appeared. A middle-aged individual held the golden decree, and he was in charge of overseeing the Fire Nation Capital. He sent the order to tell the little Stone to quickly have the audience. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Hao’s temper rose. He now really wanted to go and give the other party a beating. As long as a supreme expert didn’t appear, he had nothing to be scared of. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big red, I brought you out to help you learn. Now that there’s nothing left, you should go to the Fire Nation’s ancestral ground,” Shi Hao said. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The big red bird was moved, but he was a bit hesitant. “Why do I feel like the outside is pretty good right now? Won’t it be okay if I go study after a bit of time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just go sooner!” Shi Hao fetched a stone case. Inside was a scarlet red feather, the one that Little Red left behind. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He asked Huo Ling’er for her help in sending the big red bird into the ancestral ground. He said that this was what he agreed on with the Fire Nation’s guardian spirit, and that he was sending it a disciple. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why don’t I know about this?” Huo Ling’er was confused. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Hao said, “It’s like this, Little Red is interested in a mountain treasure, but right now, I can’t find it. I’m scared that it might become frantic and turn around to find trouble for me, so I’ll send big red first to give an explanation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huo Ling’er was unconvinced. Then, she suddenly understood and revealed a smile that was yet not a smile. She looked at him and said, “Big red definitely doesn’t know about this. You are just throwing it there randomly as a hostage?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What kind of words are those? The guardian spirit will definitely search its sea of consciousness and find out that I truly don’t have the mountain treasure. In addition, big red truly wants it to become its master. Isn’t this the best of both worlds?” Shi Hao said. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big red is truly unlucky. In the future, it is definitely going to be turned into a sandbag!” Huo Ling’er giggled. From their relationship, she decided she was still going to help him out here. </span></p>
 <p><span style>It was because she knew that guardian spirit’s temperament. Recently, it wanted to avoid the incoming disaster, but it had always been thinking about the mountain treasure. It might just decide to carry Shi Hao away before disappearing. </span></p>
 <p><span style>If things weren’t explained, that little red bird might really come out and seek trouble. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Fortunately, Huo Ling’er had a piece of void beast skin and could use it to quickly move through the void. She could immediately travel across the endless mountains and rivers with great speed. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The unfortunate big red bird was longing for the future and carried wonderful hopes as it was sent into the Fire Nation’s ancestral grounds. It was going to meet the great guardian spirit that was about to go into hiding, yet in the end… Before Huo Ling’er left, she heard it scream miserably. It was given a good beating. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You dare to call yourself big red?!” The guardian spirit turned into a furious little bird. The devilish child had called it Little Red before, yet afterwards, the one that came over actually called itself big red. Was he trying to take advantage of it?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t hit me anymore, master. In the future, I’ll be known as little little red, is that enough?” The big red bird wanted to cry but no tears came out. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who is your master? Where’s the mountain treasure?” The furious little bird asked. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“What mountain treasure?” The big red bird was confused. </span></p>
 <p><span style>As a result, thunder struck down, almost turning it into charcoal. It immediately understood and cried out miserably, “Damn that devilish brat! He used me to take the blame!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Too insincere… you don’t know how miserable big red was. He was almost cooked alive.” Huo Ling’er complained after returning. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Hao released a hollow laugh and said, “You don’t know how thick his skin is. I believe that it can definitely grasp an opportunity to become the guardian spirit’s disciple.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, Shi Hao turned around and looked at the nine-headed lion, flame crow and the others and said, “Little brother, flame crow, all of you should return as well. The wasteland region is going to become chaotic. Roaming about outside will be dangerous.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Stone, you are regarding us as outsiders here.” The flame crow seemed to have realized something and said, “You definitely have something to do. After sending off Big Red first, you then let us go on our way. You are doing this out of fear that something bad might happen to us, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huo Ling’er, the nine-headed lion, and the others immediately widened their eyes. They felt like he was most likely going to knock on death’s door and accept the Immortal Mountain’s invitation. He didn’t want them to get caught up in his troubles. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shi Hao, hurry and have the audience. Otherwise, you will take responsibility for the consequences!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was ignored for many days. The little Stone didn’t appear, making the individual who held the Immortal Mountain’s golden decree furious. His words were extremely intense, as if he was condemning Shi Hao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This raised a huge uproar. Was this a clear declaration of their position? They were now focusing on the little Stone and were going to thoroughly dispose of him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Before that, there was some secret information being passed around that the Immortal Mountain wasn’t doing this to make things difficult for the little Stone and were instead calmly bringing him to their sect. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“The little Stone won’t lower his head and loathes being called by others like this, so he hasn’t replied this whole time. This angered the expert holding the decree, and as a result, killing intent emerged.” Someone made this speculation. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Hao’s mood really was rather terrible. Even though there was a blood connection and they might be relatives, making him have an audience? Do you guys really think of yourself as the king of the world? He was extremely disgusted. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am inside the Medicine Capital. You all can have an audience with me.” In the end, Shi Hao released this message, opposing the other party with equal harshness. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The outside world was once again thrown into an uproar. The little Stone finally reappeared. This was a provocation! To have the Immortal Mountain’s people meet him instead, he was truly bold!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Immortal Mountain’s people were furious. After being ignored for several days, the other party didn’t show himself and instead acted in such an arrogant manner. The individual holding the decree knew vaguely that the little Stone might have some blood connection with them, but this still wasn’t good. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The Immortal Mountain’s people didn’t come to the Medicine Capital. The great figures of this ancient city moved first instead. They visited homes one after another, raising a huge commotion. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The outstanding and brilliant little Stone was actually in the Medicine Capital; this was shocking information. Many people came to this place to see if they could take a look at the little Stone. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Regardless of what was said, the little Stone’s name was well known throughout the wasteland region. Once he grew up, he might become an unmatched supreme expert. Who would dare to look down on him then? The powerful individuals that had gathered were naturally here to create some good karma between them. </span></p>
 <p><span style>When a few great figures saw Shi Hao, they all became a bit scared and upset, because conflict almost sparked between them in the divine valley’s third formation when they coveted his bronze piece. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Many people directly wiped away their cold sweat. Fortunately, nothing happened back then, otherwise, they would have most likely died. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Hao was all smiles. After his identity was revealed, many great figures send people to deliver gifts. They were the spiritual medicines he needed, and as a result, his unhappiness from before was made up. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Sigh,</span></i><span style> there are enough rations to feed the divine bug. It can last it for a while.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fortunately, this young bug only needed to be fed after several days, and each day, it would eat spiritual medicines. In that case, Shi Hao decided that he might as well let the divine bug eat all of it for now. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After several days passed, the Immortal Mountain’s people still hadn’t come. </span></p>
 <p><span style>On the contrary, Shi Hao obtained some news that a letter was sent to Stone Country’s Martial Imperial Manor. It was then passed on to his Wasteland Heavenly Lord Manor, which could now also be called Wasteland Heavenly King Manor, because the Stone Emperor had long given the order to change the name. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Hao rose to his feet and said, “Let’s go pay the Stone Country Capital a visit!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huo Ling’er, the nine-headed lion, flame crow, and the others didn’t leave yet. After hearing what he said, they were all shocked. They advised him not to act rashly. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Hao shook his head. He was not acting impulsively. Regardless of whether that letter was real or fake, he still had to take a look. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to remain calm, because his parents and grandfather were still outside this region. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s not a big deal even if the Immortal Mountain’s people left for Stone Country Capital. I am not scared of them.” Shi Hao laughed coldly. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He passed on a message inwardly towards the little pagoda and said, “The decree of the rain deity is still rather tasty, right? This time, I’ll invite you to eat the Immortal Mountain’s decree.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Last time, the decree was already broken. This time, I hope it is a complete and powerful deity’s decree,” the little pagoda said. It wanted to eat the imprints left on the deity’s decree. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Hao laughed and said, “Alright, this time, let’s go directly to the Stone Country Capital. Let’s see what they can do. So what if you all are from the Immortal Mountain?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He did not feel any fear. If the Immortal Mountain has some blood relations with him and are truly sincere, then he wouldn’t act rudely. If they are arrogant and threaten him, then he didn’t mind fighting a great battle!</span></p>
