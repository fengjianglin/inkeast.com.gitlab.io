 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These three individuals, every one of them had hair white like snow, their skin sparkling like that of a baby’s, extremely soft and smooth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was definitely not normal. Their ages were definitely terrifyingly great, one could tell from those eyes filled with great changes. However, their bodies were all sparkling white, flourishing with life energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What white haired child’s countenance, what immortal flesh divine bones? It was precisely this. Their cultivation realms were unimaginable, originally living for endless time, yet they still maintained such exuberant vitality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The three of them were definitely powerful, frightening beyond imagination!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, this was still not everything. A cool breeze blew over, one more person arriving from the rear, his figure tall and long, the space between the brows shining, great dao imprint displayed. Another matchless figure descended.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Four great experts, all of them bathed in immortal splendor arrived while treading on pure white mist, as if they were everlasting true immortals who had crossed thousands of tribulations, ten thousand dangers. It was as if they walked over from the distant uncivilized past, tearing apart time-space to come here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was too sacred, unimaginable. Their auras were so suffocating the golden little ant couldn’t help but tremble all over. This was only the immortal mist they naturally emitted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Meng Tianzheng!” On the other side, the first person who appeared released a short shout. Moon-white daoist robes fluttered about, the purple-golden crown on his head flickered with immortal dao might. His eyes were like stellar streams that could peer through time, deep and immeasurable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His voice carried a type of demonic nature. This person looked like he was full of immortal dao energy, yet when he released the short shout, it was as if he wanted to shatter one’s soul, extremely terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Great Elder’s body shone slightly, cutting apart a layer of ripples, wiping out this sound wave!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao and the little ant’s expressions changed. In that instant, Great Elder already exchanged a blow with the other party. That person’s shout carried terrifying power, if it was a normal person here, their primordial spirit would have been directly destroyed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A battle on this level was decisive and astonishing after all, the domain touched upon deep and profound. Creatures at the Void Dao Realm could only sigh with astonishment and look up to them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Meng Tianzheng, I know you are extremely strong, but if you dare come and behave atrociously in my Wang Family, you are still not enough!” That golden-robed individual also walked up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His figure vanished with each step, as if he was currently arriving from before heaven and earth were opened. An unmatched aura pervaded the air, brilliant colors overflowing, making one feel the urge to bow down before him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When one reached his level of power, their strength would become exceptional, simply unimaginable!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, his golden magical robe had the sun, moon, and stars embroidered on them. Along with his movements, those great stars all rumbled and moved about, releasing noises that were clear and real!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the magical robes, there were stars condensed on its surface. Just how domineering was this? It was definitely terrifying beyond compare!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With things already like this, Shi Hao finally knew that Great Elder was named Meng Tianzheng, that this was his original name. The number of people who knew this name in this world was definitely not high.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wang Da<span id="footnote-ref-9678"><a href="#footnote-9678">[1]</a></span>, Wang Er<span id="footnote-ref-c4bf"><a href="#footnote-c4bf">[2]</a></span>, you all truly are something, daring to holler at me.” Great Elder spoke calmly, staring at the two before him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Da, Wang Er, who were these? Shi Hao felt a bit of hesitation. Could it be that they were Wang Family’s number one and two?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Meng Tianzheng, your achievements are indeed great, known as a generation covering expert, powerfully dominating a long period of time. However, talents will always emerge from the mountains and rivers. With hundreds of thousand of years passed, your era has passed. After coming to my Wang Family to provoke us like this, this matter has not ended yet!” Wang Da said, his moon-white daoist robes moving about. Powerful winds roared, the heavenly dome collapsing. Under his loftiness, heaven and earth rumbled with noise, mountains and rivers trembling restlessly!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just how great of a wave of power was this, every action affecting the stability of the world. It was just too shocking!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“My brothers have all already reached the summit. Even if we faced you alone, we might not be weaker than you. Do you still wish to act powerfully before my Wang Family? Today, you won’t be able to leave!” Wang Er said indifferent. The golden daoist robe’s stars shook, starlight rushing into the heavens, placing heaven and earth in chaos!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You all feel like now that you made some accomplishments in your cultivation, you are at the very summit of life, right? That you can look down on the Nine Heavens Ten Earths, subdue whoever you want to subdue?” Great Elder asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Regardless, now that you came today, you can just forget about leaving!” Wang Er said coldly again. Stellar streams crashed down one after another, appearing in his surroundings. It was as if he was standing at the center of the great cosmos.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“After your cultivations have risen, your tempers have indeed become greater than before. In the past, you all definitely didn’t act like this in front of me.” Great Elder said indifferently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heng!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">” Wang Da released a cold snort. “We already know that you came for a youngster’s sake, wishing to help him vent his resentment, give us a warning that we cannot touch him, right? Then let me tell you right now, we will definitely kill this young man. Even if we don’t kill him right now, we have to subdue him. My Wang Family will not tolerate him stirring up any more trouble!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Meng Tianzheng, your arrival is perfect, bringing him right to us!” In the back, the other two’s voices were also resolute, about to ruthlessly take action!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wang San, Wang Si, the two of you have always behaved with low-profiles in the past. It seems like you’ve both really made remarkable progress, behaving this rudely in front of me.” Great Elder’s voice carried a hint of mockery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the distance, everyone was stunned, every member of Wang Family shaken up. When they heard Wang Da and Wang Er, they were still a bit confused, but when they heard what Wang San and Wang Si said, they woke up, realizing who that was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were Wang Family’s ancestors, already tens of thousands of years since there were any news of them. They had no idea if these ancestors were still in Wang Family, yet today, four of them appeared at once!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were Immortal Wang’s children, their talents exceptional, causing a sensation in the past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Immortal Wang was the grandson of a true immortal. The reason why Wang Family was the way it was in the present world was all because of his accomplishments. Meanwhile, the other thing he was known for was that he had nine children, each more formidable than the next, known as the Nine Dragons!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was something extremely rare, not a single one of his nine children ordinary. Their talents were exceptional. This had previously left the other long life families greatly shaken!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, this was also the reason why Wang Family dared to do almost anything. After the nine dragons grew up, they became Wang Family’s ‘backing’. The appearance of these nine individuals would stir up tremendous waves, able to sweep through everything before them!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These nine individuals were too formidable, long growing up, becoming the most powerful exceptional experts of this world, catching up to the most ancient group of people from the distant past. This was why they were now so arrogant today.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even when facing Great Elder, they still dared to challenge him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It really is four ancestors, they actually appeared!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who cares who the enemy is? As long as the ancestors are here, he will definitely be easily suppressed!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The people here began to discuss among themselves, the excitement turning into noise, this place immediately becoming loud with activity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao and the golden little ant learned about the details from their discussions, knowing who the four individuals were. They immediately felt waves of chills pass through their bodies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These four great experts were too frightening. Wang Family’s backing was terrifyingly great!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Meng Tianzheng, others might fear you, but Wang Family does not. Since you dared pay us a visit, then pay the price!” Wang Si shouted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, they had real names, just that others were used to calling them based on their ranking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I came to demand an explanation, not to be threatened by you all.” Great Elder said indifferently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Heh</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">, let me give it a try. After so many years had passed, I’ve already wanted to fight you.” Wang Da said. The snow-white daoist robes produced roaring heavenly winds. He quickly moved over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Immortal splendor shone, mists hazy. He disappeared from his original location. At the same time, the heavens trembled intensely. He turned into a streak of lightning, attacking Great Elder, all types of magical laws interweaving!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was just too fast, and too terrifying. It was difficult for the outside world to know just what kind of clash it was that was carried out, only knowing that the attack power was incomparable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Heavens, the sky was blasted through!” Someone released a suppressed cry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A streak of light erupted between the two, rushing into outer space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Honglong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not long afterwards, there were stars that descended, blasted down by their great divine abilities. They flew across the air, guided over by a mysterious energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was Wang Da’s attack. He reached out a hand, grabbed a great star, refined it into a sphere, and then smashed it towards Great Elder!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just how domineering was this? The might was incomparable!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only, Great Elder didn’t fear him. With a wave of his sleeves, when the star descended, it directly exploded, but all of the terrifying energy radiance was sucked away by his sleeve.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them continuously took action, figures flying about. Then, a loud and clear&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">pa</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;sound could be heard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone was immediately shocked, because they knew that there was definitely a result. Only, they didn’t know who was the winner or loser. One shouldn’t think that not much time had passed, because with the two individuals’ matchless divine abilities, they definitely traded thousands of moves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the pure white immortal mist scattered, Great Elder stood there calmly, while Wang Da stood on the other side, eyes surging with flames of rage, about to gush out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was because there was a huge palm imprint on his face. His essence energy was flourishing, life force overflowing, skin was originally snow-white and sparkling,. Yet now, it was scarlet red, slapped powerfully in the face by a palm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was, without a doubt, done by Great Elder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The scene became dead silent, even Wang Er and the others shocked. They never expected that after all these years, after they already became the most powerful individuals of this world, they still weren’t a match for Great Elder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Meng Tianzheng, you… good, good, good! Today’s matters still haven’t ended!” Wang Da was seething with rage, all of his white hair standing on end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This matter hasn’t ended to begin with. I came precisely to demand an explanation, for this young man’s sake. You all didn’t apologize, instead taking action against me, there is naturally no way for us to remain friendly!” Great Elder said coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Meng Tianzheng, you are indeed strong, but there are nine of us brothers. Even with just a few of us here, it is enough to suppress you!” Wang Er said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is that so? Let me take a look then, see if the heavens and earth will be in chaos when all nine dragons come out, if you can sweep through the Nine Heavens Ten Earths!” Great Elder replied coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“OId thing, you are too arrogant. If our nine brothers join hands, even the skies can be overturned, let alone you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Haha…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">” Great Elder laughed. His expression then became serious. Come then, nine dragons, let me see that unmatched divine strength throughout time you all are known for, just come at me together!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Old man, you are courting death!” Wang Si said with an extremely cold voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Five waves of blood energy rose from Wang Family at the same time, every one of them like smoke signals as they rushed high into the sky, shaking up this great world. That type of power was too terrifying!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Cease your recklessness.” However, at this moment, a short voice sounded, making those waves of blood energy all stop. Then, the terrifying auras restrained, gradually disappearing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“When brother Tianzheng visits, how can you all act impudent?” An extremely aged voice sounded. In addition, a silvery-white wave of blood energy overflowed, rushing into outer space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, it turned into great dao flowers, gathering the star essence, carrying strong heaven and earth essence. It quickly returned, entering the place where the voice had transmitted from just now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Immortal Wang, you were still alive after all, not dying in meditation.” Great Elder’s expression was serious, feeling pressure for the first time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao and the little ant had long become stunned. Just what kind of cultivation was this? Great dao flowers bloomed in outer space, gathering the essence of the stars, bringing it back to use for oneself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was too shocking. That level of power was unimaginable!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Father, why aren’t you letting us take action?” Wang Si said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bring the guest in.” Immortal Wang’s voice sounded, his might unquestionable!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Da, Wang Er, and the others didn’t dare go against this decision, their faces all sinking as they departed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We… really are going inside?” The little golden ant’s throat was dry. This place was even more alarming than a dragon pool or tiger den, he naturally didn’t want to go inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We came for an explanation, so we naturally have to enter.” Great Elder said calmly. Then, he absent-mindedly looked into the horizon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were going to face Immortal Wang and the Nine Dragons!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao knew that it was going to be extremely dangerous, that there was danger to their life at every turn. However, Great Elder didn’t stop, determined to obtain an explanation. This was to help him eliminate future dangers!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If they succeeded in forcing back a long life family, then it would definitely shake up the Nine Heavens Ten Earths, produce heaven overflowing great waves!</span></p>
