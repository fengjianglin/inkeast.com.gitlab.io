Then, he slammed his foot straight down on Bei Feng’s stomach. He overlooked his opponent with bright eyes.</span></p>

The formidable youth, Bei Feng, was once again on his back.</span></p>

Bei Feng was an outstandingly talented youth, and he was revered by his entire clan. They could not believe that he lost just like this, let alone to such a small child!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Many people from Wolf Village drew their bows with the intent to kill Shi Hao.

This was the beginning of a rough battle.</span></p>

He placed the body in front of the people from Wolf Clan to protect himself.</span></p>

He could no longer maintain his usual gloomy and cool-headed composure, nor could he restrain himself anymore. Today, he was inflicted with extraordinary shame and humiliation. Being caught like this by an infant was a feeling worse than being killed. He struggled with all his strength and sent a fist towards the little guy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though Shi Hao lacked sufficient experience, his hands and eyes were quick.

It slammed against Bei Feng’s chest, causing his body to shake violently. Blood poured out of his mouth, and the fist that he sent out lost power.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The little guy didn’t stop here. He lifted Bei Feng who was a lot taller than he was before quickly rushing towards Shi Linghu and the others.</span></p>

His hair was completely dishevelled, and compared to that handsome cold youth from before, it was like the difference between heaven and earth. He was truly in a sorry state.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While he was still a distance of around eight to nine meters away, the little guy fiercely tossed Bei Feng out of his hands, and with a splat, Bei Feng landed in front of Shi Linghu and the others. He rolled a few times before spitting out some more blood. His eyes were filled with anger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Child, weren’t you acting quite vicious before? Keep acting arrogant, why stop now?!” After Shi Feijiao finished talking, he took large steps forward and then stepped on Bei Feng, causing his body to release a cracking sound. Bei Feng ‘s breastbone immediately snapped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Their strengths were similar, but right now, Bei Feng was a lowly prisoner who naturally could not defend himself due to having his breastbone broken. The pain was so intense that he began groaning and sweating profusely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little guy, you’re too kindhearted. Just then, when facing the enemy, you had plenty of chances to injure him and missed them all. Then after capturing him, your methods were too light. Doing things in such a way can become very dangerous.” Shi Linghu was teaching him on the side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yiya</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">!” The little guy was a bit embarrassed, and almost seemed to be a completely different person from the little tiger before. This was the first time he fought with all of his strength, and the only reason he acted this way was due to seeing his uncle wounded after almost being shot to death. The enemy was too barbaric, and that’s why he urgently wanted to join the fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Greetings, friends from Stone Village, show some mercy, ask for whatever comes to mind. We can talk things over.” The Wolf Villagers were anxious. This kind of potential was shockingly rare in a youth. If he were to die, their clan would suffer huge losses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Now you want to talk? You steal our prey that we worked so bitterly for and even attempted to kill our clansmen. When you ruthlessly and cold-bloodedly shot at us, why didn’t you think of the consequences?! ” Shi Linghu angrily said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Peng!</span></p>

One of the bones in Bei Feng’s arms snapped, causing his face to twist in pain. However, he still didn’t mutter a word.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t! Stop! Everything is our fault, can’t we apologize for our crimes?” An elder from Wolf Village yelled out anxiously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even their hunting squad captain yelled loudly, requesting to negotiate. He was a towering individual over two meters in height and was normally an oppressing and imposing person. However, right now, he was no longer the unyielding and overbearing person he was earlier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Apologize my ass. Before we talk about anything else, we are going to beat him up first!” Er Meng’s father said this in a spitting rage. These days, everyone in Stone Village held back stomachs full of fire. How could this end with just a sentence?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hong!</span></p>

It directly lacerated a part of his flesh, and his whole body flew over ten meters horizontally .</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You brat, you dare scowl at me? Four or five of my brothers were almost killed by you. Every arrow was shot ruthlessly, penetrating their inner organs. Where’s your arrogant strength now?! Show me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Peng</span></p>

Despite Bei Feng being so strong, he also had a few bones broken. His mouth twitched, and blood spilt out like water.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not long ago, his attitude was insulting, callous and tyrannical. Right now, he became their prisoner. There were injuries all over his face, his hair was scattered everywhere, and blood covered his body. He didn’t say a single word. The difference between his past self and him right now was just too great.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Peng</span></p>

That type of grim and arrogant person made everyone’s teeth ache with anger. Now, everyone got a chance to give a piece of revenge, you get a kick and I get a kick. Living in such a desolate place, every person had a well-built physique. After a round of this, Bei Feng was almost torn apart. Who knew how many of his bones had snapped or had gone soft.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Stop!”</span></p>

They armed their huge bows and wanted to exert pressure to alleviate the situation. If this continued, even Bei Feng would become a cripple and lose all hope in rising up as a genius.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“All of you, stop and go stand on the side, we are not done with him. Let us take out our anger on him before we talk!” Shi Feijiao said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone gave a kick and a slap. Not long after, Bei Feng was tormented until he was in a truly terrible shape. His nose was bloodied, his face was swollen, and bones were broken everywhere. He had a miserable appearance and no longer had any traces of that callous expression from before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this precise time, a group of children rushed up, especially Pi Hou. He kicked him with all his might and said, “You almost shot my father to death. Who cares if you are arrogant, so what! Weren’t you still captured by the little guy!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Our clan’s little guy is only a bit older than three years old, while you’re over ten, yet you can’t even beat him. Do you still think you can act so domineeringly and stand above others?” The group of children beat him up while taunting him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, a group of people had surrounded Shi Hao, not stingy at all with their praise. Not even the people of Stone Village thought that he was this strong, that he was able to directly capture a youth whose terrifying strength was on par with Shi Linghu’s.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Friends from Stone Village, did you get rid of your anger yet? This should be good enough, right?” Everyone from Wolf Village was getting worried. If this continued, a genius would be turned into a cripple. After that, what difference would there be between him and a dead dog?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright fine, let’s discuss then!”Shi Linghu sat his buttocks down on Bei Feng’s body and practically made him his mount. This made the people from Wolf Village want to rip their own hearts out. That strong man who was almost two and a half meters in height was using that much strength to sit down! Even an ox would collapse from that weight!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But they were under the mercy of Stone Village, so they had to yield and could only use kind words to persuade them. They did not dare show their resentment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We are friends that live in the middle of this wasteland. Even if we had a few disagreements, we will still see each other often. We beg you for forgiveness of our recklessness this time.” A rather eloquent man from Wolf Village’s hunting squad said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My ass, what do you mean we meet with each other so often? Everything is so easy to say. What were you doing before? Why did you want to kill our clansmen?!”Shi Feijiao criticized.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a wave of his hand, Shi Linghu said, “Stop with the bullshit, we don’t want to hear it. Tell us, how will you compensate us?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This…”The Wolf Villagers all frowned. The captain of the hunting squad said: “We will make amends and apologize here, and we will give all the prey to you. How about that?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Er Meng’s father rolled his eyes and said: ”The prey was originally ours. You injured so many of us. You think just gifting us some stuff will make us even?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright fine. From now on, we’ll leave this part of the mountain and we’ll never cross into your territory again. We’ll also return all of the prey back to you. How about that?” A person from Wolf Village said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bullshit! These were what we had before. After all this talk, you do not have a speck of sincerity!” A person with poor temperament from Stone Village shouted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Linghu waved his hand and said, “I don’t want to speak with you all anymore. It’s alright for us to release this youth, but in addition to everything stated before, leave behind all the weapons you have on you, and only then can you carry him back. Also, don’t ever appear in front of us again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What? No way!” The people from Wolf Village shouted. To them, weapons were like their second lives. Living in the middle of the mountain, they could not survive without these weapons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One must be aware that there were very few metal deposits here, and it was difficult to extract any. It was hard to obtain even one handy weapon, and they took a long time to smelt and polish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then there’s nothing more to talk about. Someone come and chop this kid’s head off for me and bring it back to Wolf Village.” Shi Linghu bellowed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Okay!” A youthful and loud voice responded, and with a broadsword, he swung down to behead Bei Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t do it, we agree!” An important person from Wolf Village shouted hurriedly to stop him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The faces of the other people from Wolf Village turned ugly. “Do we really have to give away all these weapons?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If we don’t have weapons, we can make more. Although it is time-consuming, in the end we will still have some hope, but people… we cannot resurrect them. Bei Feng’s potential is extremely high. In these large and desolate lands, a person of his caliber is rare. In the future, it will be him who protects our clan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The people from Wolf Village all compromised and piled up the iron arrows, Dragon Horned Bows as well as the sharp broadswords one after another. They all felt as if their hearts were bleeding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Originally, there should have been a bloody battle, however, with the sudden appearance of the little guy confronting the dreadful innate talent of Bei Feng, the battle changed, and a bloody conflict was avoided. Otherwise, no one knew how many people would have died.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The group of people returned from their bountiful journey back to Stone Village.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During the following days, Stone Village was quite peaceful. However, the depths of the mountain was certainly not calm. Often, the cries of beasts shocked the sky and shook the mountains, causing avalanches to rumble about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Chief, sooner or later that dreadful Suan Ni from the heart of the mountain will die. Recently, it continuously roars and struggles.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A person came and reported directly to Shi Yunfeng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That is perhaps a true species of an archaic descendant. It could be considered powerful even within the depths of the mountain. If we could somehow obtain its remains, extract its true blood and copy down its skeleton’s primitive symbols, then it could undoubtedly be considered a heaven shocking treasure!”</span></p>
