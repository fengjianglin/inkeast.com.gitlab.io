They brought a bottle of wine and sat down here, drinking a glass. Then, they poured down a cup onto the grave.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were a few years older than Shi Hao, but Shi Hao’s constitution was strong even when they were little. At first, he still chased after their butts, but later on, he passed all of them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I truly don’t want to believe that you’ve already left us. How can you just die?” Ermeng’s eyes turned red.&nbsp;</span></p>

They continuously poured wine, cup after cup on the ground. In these three months, they would come here every few days and drink, wishing they could see Shi Hao again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Forget about the sincere feelings of growing up together, just the things Shi Hao did for the village already made him unforgettable. Their hearts felt stifled.&nbsp;</span></p>

Everyone is saying how he is unmatched under heaven. That was originally little Hao’s title,” said Pihou.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though they grew up in Stone Village, they knew a few things about the outside world as well. It was because they always came to and from Stone Country Imperial Palace, so the information traveled freely.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because Qingfeng inherited the position of Stone Country Emperor, he always traveled back and forth netween these two places.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What do you guys think? Is there really reviving grass in this world? How great would it be if we found one? I really want little Hao to live…” Dazhuang spoke in a downcast manner.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I always felt as if he hadn’t left, almost as if he is still beside us,” Snot Baby said. He was the only child that was even smaller than Shi Hao back then, and today, he had also grown up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finally, the carried each other up. While reeking of alcohol, they descended the hill and returned to Stone Village.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If one were to ask who was the most broken-hearted in the village these past few days, it would definitely be Village Chief Shi Yunfeng. He had personally raised Shi Hao, so his feelings for him were similar to those towards a son.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He truly couldn’t get over this and accept this result. During these three months, he seemed to have aged ten years. His hair was snow white, and he always appeared dejected and downcast.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man would always sit at the front of the village alone, often for an entire day at a time. He wouldn’t respond even when the villagers called out to him. When everyone saw this, they all felt extremely sad.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Child, when you were brought over, you only reached my knee. You were so weak that you were going to die at any moment.” The old clan leader muttered. He looked at the courtyard, feeling as if he could still hear the weak infant’s crying.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Later on, you finally survived. We lived together, depending on each other. It truly was a time full of joy…” He sighed softly. Tears flowed down from his old eyes. He could vaguely see those large blinking eyes, the little fellow who tottered about as he walked around, pulling on the big red dog’s tail while releasing tender shouts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Village chief, let’s go eat. Don’t feel bad anymore.” The villagers tried to advise him. Everyone was feeling extremely terrible.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have no appetite.” The old man lowered his head, using his hand to caress a small pot. This was something that the little guy used every day back then, sneakily cooking beast milk in it to drink, to prevent others from finding out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, how could everyone not know? The beast milk was all brought over by the uncles.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Grandpa Chief, what is outside those great mountains? I want to see for myself and leave the great wastelands.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he grew a bit older, Shi Hao already began to yearn for the outside world, wishing to explore it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These words still seemed to ring by his ears. Shi Yunfeng self blamingly shook his head. “I shouldn’t have agreed… We should have just lived here, never leaving this place. How great would that be? Something like this wouldn’t have happened.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Village chief, we know you feel terrible, but you have to eat something. Otherwise, we won’t eat either.” A group of children walked over with red eyes. They were worried for the old chief.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, people have lives to live and days to pass. We cannot always dwell in the past.” Shi Yunfeng dejectedly stood up and said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only, the villagers knew that it was too hard for him to dispel those thoughts. In fact, no one could forget Shi Hao. When they thought of him, they all felt bitter.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was still a small courtyard in the village where mourning also happened. Those were Shi Hao’s parents. During these three months, they had remained inside Stone Village and only left two days ago. Immortal Mountain had pressing matters, asking Qingfeng to send them the message to return.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the outside world, the Qin Clan was currently discussing in Immortal Mountain. They wanted Qin Hao to quickly ascend, because the heavenly path was going to be cut off soon. He would then forever lose the chance to do so.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I won’t go up.” Qin Yining shook her head. She felt extremely pained. She was going to stay in Stone Village, not wishing to leave the lower realm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Shi Ziling heard this, his eyes released divine radiance. “I am going up!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A flame had long been lit within him. It had been burning ferociously for more than three months. He wanted to go to the higher realms. There was going to be a day when he would wipe out those inheritances and demand an explanation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For the sake of revenge, he had to enter the higher realms. Even if he was filled with reluctance and regret, he still had to leave.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright, you go up. I’ll stay behind in Stone Village.” Qin Yining released a light sigh.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mother, come together with us. Older brother also wished for you to be happy. He doesn’t want you to be broken-hearted,” Qin Hao advised.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Yining shook her head. She was overwhelmed by sorrow.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finally, Shi Ziling returned to Stone Village. He stood in front of that grave for an entire night. Then, he resolutely left. On his back was his own golden spear. He was going to the higher realms.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“From here on out, I will immerse myself in bitter cultivation. I will no longer waste my time away. My pride, my ferocity, my core, let it all burn!” He sorrowfully roared.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Ziling and Qin Hao left. They followed a mysterious heavenly road and disappeared from this realm.&nbsp;</span></p>

They also brought more detailed and reliable information with them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This left their elders surprised, discussing with them.&nbsp;</span></p>

Even if he entered the higher realms, he would still shine brilliantly and suppress an area sooner or later.”</span></p>

Recently, an eighteen or nineteen year old expert has also appeared in my higher realms, sweeping through all his peers in Heavenfall Province, known as unmatched in his generation. In the end, he entered Heavenfall Academy and fought a decisive battle against their ‘exceptional talent’. He seemed to have won and also joined Heavenfall Academy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Time passed quickly. More than half a year had already passed since Shi Hao passed away. During this period of time, regardless of whether it was Western Sect, Immortal Mountain, or the others, contacting the higher realms became more and more difficult.&nbsp;</span></p>

This bird was incredibly lowly, always running away ahead of time.&nbsp;</span></p>
