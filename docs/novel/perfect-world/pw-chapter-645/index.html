He felt that that person was a bit special and familiar. He had a feeling that there was some blood connection between them. This made his heart jump wildly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao’s mind was shaking. He felt incomparably excited.</span></p>

It was the same type of feeling as what he felt on Fiend Island.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao was extremely nervous. He didn’t know if he saw the wrong person.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was because the cultivator was too young, only looking twenty or thirty years old, not aged at all and surging with blood energy. He was clearly a young man. His appearance was different from Grandpa Fifteen as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is it grandfather?”</span></p>

This person did not show his ‘true appearance’.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why? I feel like he is quite similar, a type of intimate feeling of the same bloodline.” Shi Hao said to himself. He found it hard to calm down. However, when there were so many people here, he couldn’t reveal anything.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He stood far away, using the dual-pupil to observe that person. He found that the other party’s pupils would become deep from time to time, carrying a trace of great changes. This was a bit strange, and only with the dual-pupil did he notice this change.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao remained calm and collected, using the true primordial record to hide his aura. No one could detect anything different from him. He looked completely ordinary as he silently watched that person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soon after, he saw that person accidentally look towards Immortal Mountain’s people, as if he was searching for something.</span></p>

Maybe he still wanted to see Shi Ziling and the others, reluctant to give up on those emotions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao noticed that this ‘youth’ that had been accidentally detected by him signed up to take one of the three thousand slots, wishing to obtain the qualifications to enter the secret realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is grandpa trying to do? He… could it be that he wants to see Qin Hao and seize a chance where they can be alone?” When he thought of this possibility, Shi Hao’s mind trembled. This was undoubtedly extremely dangerous.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He carefully thought to himself and silently analyzed the situation. He wanted to confirm whether or not this was his grandfather. In the end, he felt that he could confirm with seventy percent certainty that this was his grandfather!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao could guess how his grandfather was feeling, and he slowly understood.&nbsp;</span></p>

He just wanted to secretly see how his other grandson really was, so he was going to enter the secret realm and silently take a look.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Grandfather…” Shi Hao felt rather sore inside for him.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Shi Hao thought of the things his grandpa said. He obtained the demonic sovereign’s true blood and refined a portion of it, which lead to quite great effects.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was the same as an exceptional precious medicine. If he had time and continuously refined it, perhaps he might be able to regrow his flesh. Could this be the reason?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, not that many days had even passed! The changes were a bit too fast, making him a bit doubtful.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Apart from this, Grandpa Fifteen’s appearance had changed greatly as well, and he was young and vigorous. He was clearly a young man. Even with the dual-pupils, he didn’t see through that much, making him quite puzzled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Grandpa had said that he obtained a type of symbol from the demonic sovereign’s true blood. I wonder if it has anything to do with this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Regardless, this young man wouldn’t draw too much attention. The Qin Clan, angel of light, and others that wanted to eliminate him should not associate him with Grandpa Fifteen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a moment of hesitation, Shi Hao walked up to sign up. He was also going to go inside and follow this ‘young man’ who was most likely his grandfather. He was going to meet him inside and confirm this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the spacious land outside the city, people were gathering, filling this place densely. It was unknown just how many creatures there were here exactly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every sect contributed to maintaining order. Eventually, they had no choice but to separately select the best. There were close to ten thousand individuals in each group, and like that, they still ended up with sixty to seventy groups.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This left everyone feeling stunned. The creatures that had signed up were a bit too ‘enthusiastic’.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let me say it again. Those over a hundred years old cannot sign up. We will have to ask experts that ignited their divine flames to withdraw as well. Do not waste everyone’s time!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A sect master was incredibly dignified and imposing, transmitting this loud sound. He coldly swept his eyes over everyone. It was as if a great mountain was pressing down on them, making everyone feel suffocated.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Origin Sky Secret Realm had special natural laws that allowed those who had ignited their divine flames to enter. However, the number was limited, and Immortal Mountain as well as the other sects definitely wouldn’t give these slots to outsiders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The selection began!</span></p>

This was the first trial. Only geniuses that made it through this trial had the qualifications of taking the test.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ten thousand individuals from the first group moved together, rushing into that formaton.</span></p>

Everyone scattered apart. The formation was vast and boundless. Many people immediately got lost.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the end, only a thousand people successfully made it through. Many people were huffing and puffing, tired to the point of collapse. This formation was extremely profound, leaving them exhausted.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The remaining eight or nine thousand were all trapped in the formation. Quite a few people went unconscious from exhaustion. This was a shocking great confusion formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So difficult!” Everyone sighed and said. However, they knew that this was how it should be. There were only three thousand slots, which meant that most people were going to be washed out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The second group, third group… they were all like this. Of the ten thousand that entered, only a tenth made it through.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The young man suspected to be Grandpa Fifteen was placed in the twenty first group. As soon as he entered, he smoothly made it across, not making Shi Hao worry much at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was Shi Hao’s turn. He was in the forty-ninth group. After he entered the formation, great mists covered the skies, accompanied by the wailing of ghosts that attacked at one’s divine senses. Illusions erupted one after another.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao intentionally didn’t move that quickly, intentionally slowing himself down. However, he still made it through smoothly.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone couldn’t help but erupt into commotion.,&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have already said before that the qualification is yours alone and you cannot use spatial magical artifacts to bring others in. You are breaking the rules.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The elder pointed out with his fingers. Purple light shone boundlessly, surrounding this person. A small cauldron flew out from his body, and then it turned upside down, dropping out several individuals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was speechless. This cultivator was ashamed. He brought his companions with him and quickly fled. Being able to keep his life was already not bad.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao saw this clearly and sighed with regret. He knew that with sect master level figures overseeing that place, there was definitely no way of getting any cheap tricks by. Originally, he still had the sleeping Silver Phoenix, but earlier, he gave it to the divine striking done along with the Emperor Butterfly to keep with it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The only unfortunately thing was that the young man that was suspected to be his grandfather had already been sent in, so the two of them were definitely not going to be in the same place. He needed to spend time looking for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Because Shi Hao reserved too much strength during the power test, he was ranked towards the bottom. This group was immediately recognized as soon as they walked closer.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The great figures that were overseeing the gate looked at them coldly, completely like they were looking at a bunch of mixed fish. Some of them even coldly snorted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let me say it once more. It is extremely dangerous inside.” A great figure coldly spoke. It was clear that he thought that this group of people were too inferior and most likely wouldn’t be able to survive.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From the side, an old man actually laughed in a rather profound manner. He personally saw Shi Hao and the others through the altar. “You all should just go to my Fire Devil Palace’s region.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His eyes carried a type of coldness, as well as a type of disdain. This was completely treating them like mixed fish. If he sent these people to the Fire Devil Palace’s region, those people wouldn’t receive much threat.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The others elders felt rather regretful. If they had thought of this, they would have fought over this group. These trash fish didn’t have much fighting strength and would allow their own sects’ disciples have more abundant harvests.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wait a moment!” Someone shouted, feeling that this wasn’t fair, wishing to seize this group of people that were ranked last.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao was quite speechless. They really didn’t treat this last group of people like anything much! This was a bit too apparent, simply looking down on them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he also inwardly nodded. The symbols recorded in the True Primordial Record truly were extraordinary, hiding his aura without revealing his true divine force. Not even these old fellows could see through it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of the three thousand slots for the outside world, no one was willing to select the people in the front. They were mostly sent to those exceptional talents’ regions. These great sects’ seniors all wanted to fight over Shi Hao’s group, making many of these enthusiastic cultivators feeling speechless as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t waste any time and hurry on your way.” An old sect master spoke from the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We don’t want to go anymore. We are willing to back out.” A few individuals became dejected. This was going too far, and things were definitely not looking good for them. They weren’t going to go inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This kind of situation made others not know what to say.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do the rest of you still want to enter?” An elder that wasn’t able to win over any people asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I still want to go in.” Shi Hao replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It is very dangerous inside.” An elder said.&nbsp;</span></p>

At most, I will just pluck a bit of medicinal herbs,” Shi Hao replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then just go!” Someone said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Start up the transport formation and head for my Fire Devil Palace’s region.” Fire Devil Palace’s old man impatiently sent the remaining people inside.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rumor has it that Fire Devil Palace’s creatures are powerful Scarlet Winged Cranes. I wonder what they taste like.” Shi Hao disappeared inside, the corners of his lips slightly curled upwards as he muttered inwardly.&nbsp;</span></p>
