If news of this got out, it would definitely stir up a huge commotion. Someone at the Supreme Expert Realm killed six divine level Ape Demons that reached the extreme of body refinement, this was like something out of a fantasy, a legend!</span></p>

Even if it was an exceptional talent here, they wouldn’t have this type of accomplishments and would most likely fall!” Yun Xi didn’t know what to say. This was just too powerful!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her eyelashes trembled lightly, and her large eyes were full of a look of disbelief. Her white face was full of shock. This accomplishment was too incredible.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am also someone that walks the path of body refinement, so I naturally have some methods too. Even though they are powerful, it still isn’t enough to deal with me.” Shi Hao said in a rather carefree manner.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t dare waste time. He quickly sat down, and then his body shone. He began to treat his injuries. Holy symbols immediately covered his body, surrounding him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Four hours later, Shi Hao opened his eyes. His blood energy was surging greatly. Even though he couldn’t immediately recover from his injuries, his strength had about recovered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Xi used this time to treat herself as well. She ingested a precious pill, which improved her condition quite a bit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go. We need to hurry and search the Ape Demon’s nest while they are scared away to see if we can get anything good.” Shi Hao was quite excited for this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ancient battlefield was extremely large with mists coiling about it. They sat down in front of a stone cliff. This was the nest of an Ape Devil, and there were several caves on the cliff.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, below the cliff were a few blood-colored medicinal herbs that were like red coral. They were sparkling and brilliant. A rich fragrance wafted out from them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Blood soul grass!” Yun Xi cried out in surprised. They unexpectedly discovered several dozen stalks. This type of precious grass was extremely precious, able to increase one’s soul force. It was a specialty of these Blood Plains.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How are these medicinal herbs used?” Shi Hao asked. He came here to search for the secrets of the Ape Demon’s magical force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It needs to be refined together with many other spiritual medicines to draw out its essence. After it is taken, it can nurture the soul,” Yun Xi said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao nodded. He leapt into the air, entering a cave on the cliff. He then carefully searched about. Even though there were a few strange things, it wasn’t what he needed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you know why the Ape Devil is immune to magical force?” Shi Hao asked. This was what he cared about the most.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It is related to the fact that they always eat Blood soul grass and golden bodhi fruit.” Yun Xi spoke about everything she knew.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Just that grass?” Shi Hao’s eyes shone. He walked to the bottom the stone cliff and carefully looked around.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were over fifty stalks total. Every single one was a foot tall and sparkling with scarlet multicolored light, as if they were carved out of precious stones.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Xi explained a step further, saying, “This type of thing, for other races, doesn’t have as tremendous of a result. It is because the Ape Demon directly devours it, while we can only refine it with other medicinal herbs to absorb a bit of its essence. Eighty percent of the medicinal characteristics are not suitable to other races.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There is this type of thing…” Shi Hao was astonished.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ape Demon’s constitution was special, able to directly ingest the blood soul grass, but this wasn’t the case for other races. They couldn’t absorb the medicinal characteristics. They could only absorb a portion of the useful essence.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Xi said, “The so called useless parts are the other eighty percent of the medicinal characteristics. For us, it is fatal, but for the Ape Demons, it is instead greatly beneficial.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The higher realms were too large, and there were many races throughout the three thousand provinces. There were going to be a few races that were strange or special, and it was precisely because of this that there were so many unique and varied races.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Apart from creatures like the Ape Demons that were born in a place of death, there were only a few other races that had immunity against magical force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This restriction of constitution, can humans not eat it? I don't believe it. I’m going to give it a try.” Shi Hao said to himself. For the sake of increasing his strength, he even devoured several jin of the true supreme water that was known to not be directly ingestible.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You cannot act randomly. There were others that tried to obtain the Ape Demons’ magical force immunity, so they directly devoured the Blood soul grass, but they all ended up dying, their bodies splitting apart!” Yun Xi warned.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s fine, I’m just going to give it a try.” Shi Hao didn’t believe such a thing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Xi became anxious. “You cannot! There were many geniuses, who like you, weren’t willing to accept this, wishing to obtain this type of ability. However, they all died after forcefully testing things. Not a single person has ever succeeded!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Those people all died?” Shi Hao’s expression became grave.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They are pretty much all dead, and there were even a few exceptional talents among them. After devouring several hundred stalks, they all unfortunately died.” Yun Xi was incredibly serious as she warned.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then that’s fine,” Shi Hao laughed and said. There were just several dozen here, and it was still far being comparable to that of the rumors. He didn’t have much to worry about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This grass’ fragrance was rich, and the plants themselves were intoxicatingly red. Shi Hao sat there with his legs crossed. He directly picked one and brought it to his mouth, devouring it with just a few bites.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You cannot do this!” Yun Xi became anxious, wishing to stop him. This youth was just too stubborn.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I need power urgently. If I can obtain this type of ability, it will be extremely beneficial for me.” Shi Hao said. Then, he laughed and said, “The taste isn’t that bad, sweet and sour. A type of spiritual berry taste.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Yun Xi heard this, she almost collapsed. He ate it just like that, and was even pondering its taste. He really was just too crazy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soon after, a red light shone from Shi Hao’s body. It swirled about the surface of his body, as if it was going to set him aflame. When he carefully observed his body, he noticed that a strange type of secret force was swirling about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then, he ate the second stalk, third stalk…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hurry and stop! Even if it was just those exceptional talents, even though they ate over a hundred stalks, it was split between many days. You are eating them too quickly!” Yun Xi felt like her heart was going to jump out from her chest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She found this rather incomprehensible. This youth was just too daring. This was equivalent to suicide.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao ate twenty stalks in one go, and sure enough, he felt a strange feeling. A strange secret force took form on the outside of his body, and it felt as if it was going to tear him apart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In addition, this secret force permeated into his flesh and bones, making him feel like he was going to explode.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Confine!”</span></p>

He opened up his only heavenly passage, surrounding himself and sealing his own body, preventing his flesh from breaking apart. He began to devour even more of the Blood soul grass.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Heavens, what are you doing? You cannot eat this many!” Yun Xi became nervous. After all, this was her benefactor that saved her life, so how could she just watch him throw his life away?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t worry, I feel like it is effective.” Shi Hao said to himself. He devoured a dozen more stalks in one go.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You…” Yun Xi was stunned. She wanted to go over and stop him, but as soon as she made contact with that single heavenly passage, she was immediately restricted, finding it difficult to go through.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What was this? Could it be a heavenly passage?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was inwardly shaken. She observed it from a close range, and then she touched a few times. She really began to suspect that this was a heavenly passage!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only, why was it so special?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This simply looked like an enormous heavenly passage formed after all of the other heavenly passages were blasted apart and recombined! Its aura was terrifying, and the divine might it displayed was shocking.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Xi thought of Shi Hao in the lower realm. She remembered that his heavenly passage was special and especially large. In addition, those ten heavenly passages could link up together to form a divine ring.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, this person in front of her was even more special, actually cultivating a terrifying and mysterious single heavenly passage. It was a bit unreal.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She wanted to give it a try to see if it was real. She used various methods, different secret treasures, and even opened her own heavenly passages to give it a try. In the end, she was shaken.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This really is… as heavenly passage?!”</span></p>

Her real appearance was even exposed, producing her true appearance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that instant, gentle and supple purple hair shone as it scattered downwards. Yun Xi revealed her exceptional immortal appearance. Her forehead was sparkling white, and her eyelashes trembled slightly. Her large eyes were full of spirituality, as if she was an unmatched beauty that had walked out from a painting.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Xi immediately rushed over and said, “Hurry up and stop eating the Blood soul grass.” She grabbed Shi Hao’s shoulder and forcefully shook him, truly fearing that he would suddenly die.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sparkling hair was full of luster as it scattered down onto Shi Hao’s body. A wave of fragrance wafted through the air.&nbsp;</span></p>

He thought back to his experiences in the Hundred Shattering Mountains. Back then, the two of them wrestled about on the ground, and he even bit the other party’s ear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He raised his hand, hinting that he was fine. His palm slid past the beautiful purple hair, inadvertently touching the other party’s sparkling earlobe.&nbsp;</span></p>

She quickly backed up and stared at Shi Hao. When her beautiful and sensitive earlobe was touched, she was immediately shaken. She immediately thought of too many things in the past.&nbsp;</span></p>
