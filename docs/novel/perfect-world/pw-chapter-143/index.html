 <p><strong>Chapter 143 - Historical Ruins' Precious Treasure</strong></p>
 <p><span style>The emperor carriage emitted light. This was both an ordinary carriage for the purpose of traveling, as well as an ancient war chariot. Currently, symbols were interweaving together, forming a curtain of light as it carried the people within it. Large amounts of densely packed symbols scattered down, almost as&nbsp;if they&nbsp;were going to completely fill in the mountain valley. The walls of the valley began to split from all sides, causing giant boulders to tumble down and dust to rise into the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little guy was constantly dodging while using his precious artifact to fight back; he was facing a crisis. A streak of divine radiance shot towards him, smashing apart the ground where he previously stood as earth and stones splashed outwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The valley rumbled as its walls crumbled down. Chunks after chunks of giant rock were struck until they flew high up into the sky. The valley was beaten and ruined; smoke and dust filled the air, revealing a scenery of destruction!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“White Tiger, you are making me angry! I am going to eat you!” The little guy was angry, and his eyebrows were pinched together. He tried his hardest to take away that sparkling bone pagoda, but he never thought that the White Tiger would rush over and completely ruining everything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This spotlessly white bone pagoda was truly unique. It continued to bob up and down, and with a gentle shake, propitious vapors began to rise. It pushed apart the bone shears and precious mirror, making it difficult to approach.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You have to understand that it didn’t truly attack yet! This was merely the divine fluctuations naturally being emitted by it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, the little guy used the ancient methods carved within the ‘True Primordial Record’ in an attempt to communicate with it. He used the power of symbols to to resonate with&nbsp;the pagoda, however, right as soon as he succeeded a bit, the White Tiger interrupted, immediately startling the divine bone pagoda.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The White Tiger stood upright on the carriage. Its body could not be considered that large, yet it still had a threatening demeanor. Its eyes emitted a faint golden color, and it was as if they were&nbsp;shooting out daggers as it stared at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘You are talking to me?” It finally spoke in human speech. Its face was callous and cold, and cold light flickered within its pupils;&nbsp;they were like tail feathers ready to shoot out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t say? Fat cat, you are bringing about your own destruction!” The little guy yelled in anger. Currently, he was trying to communicate with that bone pagoda, but it was already useless. A mist proliferated outwards, pushing him away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Seal up the valley and kill him! I despise humans who speak to me like this. Hurry up and collect that precious artifact!” The White Tiger spoke, and it made its move as well. Lifting up a tiger claw, it dropped down. Immediately, it was as if a mountain was smashing downwards. The earth quaked and mountains shook, and that white expanse of symbols submerged the mountain valley.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On top of the carriage, the white tiger took out a beast skin pouch. An elderly man walked forward and accepted it. After loosening the ropes around it, that pouch immediately blossomed with multicolored light. It possessed a wave of unparalleled attractive force that wanted&nbsp;to&nbsp;suck in&nbsp;everything within the valley.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>After being agitated repeatedly like this, that bone pagoda finally woke up. It erupted with a white light that was like an ocean wave, shaking all four directions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little guy was shocked. He quickly withdrew his bone shears and precious mirror&nbsp;to protect his own body before&nbsp;quickly retreating far into the distance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What a great treasure. No matter how great the price is, I still must obtain it! You all, utilize the Heaven and Earth Pouch&nbsp;together to obtain&nbsp;it!” The White Tiger was pleasantly surprised and began to repeatedly roar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two female human geniuses inside the carriage, as well as the four buff and husky fellows walked forward, began to support the elderly man. They operated the Heaven and Earth Pouch that was refined from the skin of an Archaic descendant together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their bodies all emitted divine light&nbsp;that poured&nbsp;into that beast skin pouch, making it even more dazzling. The opening of the pouch was bright and resplendent as it swallowed everything.&nbsp;Boulders that were several tens of thousands to even millions of jin were pulled in and stored within the pouch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pouch opening was clearly not big, yet it seemed like it could take in the entire mountain and river.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little guy’s eyes were filled with divine light as he watched it. That bag was truly too great, being able to store all living things. Regardless of how many things there were, it could all be kept inside, so there was never a need to worry about not being able to bring something.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What a great treasure! If I obtain it, I can wrap up all the Archaic descendants as take out and carry it with me!” He clenched his fists tightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All types of giant boulders were flying&nbsp;into the sky&nbsp;before rushing&nbsp;into the Heaven and Earth pouch, yet&nbsp;that bone pagoda didn’t move a single inch the entire time. Thick and dense mist circulated about it, making it seem more and more&nbsp;mysterious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rise!” The White Tiger roared loudly. It also made its move, spitting out multicolored light. It scattered down on top of the Heaven and Earth pouch, making its might flourish even more.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The pure white bone pagoda was continuously agitated. Finally, the pagoda&nbsp;began to fight back; its body began to shake. The valley thoroughly cracked apart&nbsp;as&nbsp;it ascended into the air. While shaking, it created an ocean-like ripple that shook the mountains, creating a great earthquake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not good, the precious artifact is activating!” The White Tiger&nbsp;was crying out in fear. The carriage quickly rose up as if it was going to enter the clouds; it wanted to keep&nbsp;a certain distance away from the pagoda&nbsp;out of safety.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The bone pagoda began to sway, scattering out an expanse of symbols. It almost turned the carriage over and made it fall; fortunately, they were far enough away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Try again one last time. If we fail, then we are leaving immediately!” The White Tiger was unwilling to give up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They once again cooperatively operated the Heaven and Earth pouch. Light shot out in all directions, and the pouch entrance emitted large amounts of symbols. They shot out strand after strand, streak after streak in all directions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The bone pagoda trembled, quickly collecting all of the mist. It began to radiate with light, and its crystalline body seemed to almost be transparent&nbsp;as&nbsp;began to diffuse a heart-trembling fluctuation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon seeing this, the little guy was silent&nbsp;and no longer had the urge to eat White Tiger meat. He jumped on top of the Suan Ni bone mirror&nbsp;before turning&nbsp;into a streak of light. He quickly escaped far away, because he felt the&nbsp;dangerous aura approaching.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hong</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Sure enough, the land&nbsp;behind him blew up. That bone pagoda was emitting&nbsp;light, and it was as if a meteor was falling down. The mountain region collapsed, and the sky seemed to be splitting apart as well; it was as if&nbsp;a sun exploded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Terrifying waves of energy engulfed the mountain range, and quite a few mountain peaks swayed before collapsing. Smoke and dust flew everywhere, and that area was completely ruined.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What a powerful precious artifact!” The little guy flew in escape, and felt that it was truly a pity. This type of precious artifact was too powerful, and it was likely that even if the human emperor saw this, his eyes would also become red with passion. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry up!” The White Tiger roared. It knew that this treasure couldn’t be moved. Upon awakening, it far exceeded their expectations, and was not something that they could get their hands on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Could it be that this is&nbsp;a divine artifact left behind by an ancient saint right?” An elder hesitated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The carriage flew quickly, but even though they were moving fast, one of the buff men was still struck by the multicolored light’s attack. With a miserable shout, he fell out of the carriage before exploding in midair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Faster!” The White Tiger’s complexion changed, and it was fearful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had ascended above the clouds long ago, and the gap between them was already sufficient. However, below them, multicolored light continued to radiate everywhere. They covered the sky as they flew about, and rays of light would still sweep over from time to time. The people within&nbsp;the carriage supported&nbsp;up the curtain of light together, fleeing as fast as they could</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ao…</span></i><span style> White Tiger cried out miserably. Even the White Tiger was stuck by one of the divine rays of light, and while staggering, it almost fell out of the carriage. Its shoulder was penetrated, and blood continuously flowed out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With a </span><i><span style>pu</span></i><span style> sound, an elder’s chest was pierced through. He coughed out large mouthfuls of blood, almost being killed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The carriage rushed along at a fast speed, quickly streaking across the sky and escaping from this place. Blossoms of blood scattered down from the skies as they fled for their lives.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With a </span><i><span style>chi</span></i><span style> sound, the bone pagoda no longer bobbed up and down&nbsp;and&nbsp;transformed into a rainbow-colored streak. The destroyed mountain region was peaceful once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The bone pagoda is so powerful, yet it decided to escape and leave the valley?” The little guy could clearly see within the darkness that it unexpectedly left. It was in a hurry, making him extremely suspicious. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He did not waste any time, and chased after it in an instant. He pursued it the entire way, utilizing the precious mirror to fly quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the pagoda was too fast. It left behind an after image before disappearing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little guy continued to move&nbsp;forward, and the mountains and creeks quickly disappeared behind him. He did not give up, and searched&nbsp;this entire mountain range. Finally, he once again felt the fluctuations of that bone pagoda.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In front of him, a fiery light overflowed into the heavens. It was a sea of fire that burned&nbsp;with vast quantities&nbsp;of magma and lava. They bubbled about, &nbsp;dyeing the mountain peak in a deep&nbsp;red. The scene was strange and extremely terrifying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s actually a sea of fire!” The little guy was shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had not passed by this area yet during the past few days. This area was melting along with several mountain peaks, turning into magma and trickling downwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is phoenix fire! It actually appeared here!” The little guy was astonished and finally recognized&nbsp;the flames.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a&nbsp;top-notch flame for refining precious artifacts, yet it was unexpectedly gushing out from here. In reality, it was a single flame, yet in the end, it melted all of the mountains and creeks here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the heart of this mountain creek, there was a throbbing ball of fire. It was bright and resplendent like divine radiance, burning with exceptional magnificence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little guy’s pupils were suffused with divine radiance as he carefully surveyed the scene. That was definitely a precious flame. That pulsing ball of flame was like a dancing phoenix, extremely astonishing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The bone pagoda is at the heart of that flame!” The little guy was startled. He finally noticed the the bone pagoda figure. It was rising and falling there, taking in the forging and refining of the fire ball.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Could it be that it was injured, and needed to recover? Or maybe it wanted to transform, refining itself anew? This was definitely shocking, and was rarely seen within precious artifacts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The tall mountains melted, and magma surged out. It submerged the area in a fiery light. The little guy had no choice but to retreat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For the next few days, he continuously roamed about nearby. He would always stay within fifty li, waiting for that flame to extinguish. However, magma continued to bubble&nbsp;about there without any intention of stopping.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chi</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A streak of sword radiance hacked out, and a green-robed young man appeared with a bone sword in hand. He had an air of arrogance as he chopped towards the little guy, and other human figures appeared as well in succession.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One of the four great families arrived, appearing here. That green-robed man was precisely the first person who attacked the little guy after entering the Historical Remains,&nbsp;but&nbsp;fled after being attacked by the Archaic species.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little guy avoided the sword flash and stared at these people. There were old and young people, totaling to nearly twenty people. There were six or seven ‘restricted’ individuals.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You all truly are souls that have not yet dispersed. Exactly what type of enmity do you guys have with me?” The little guy asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Void God Realm. Part of the human pile made of the Four Great Races.” The green-robed young man spoke coldly. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After hearing what was said, the little guy stared blankly. Soon after, he laughed loudly. “That truly was a period of happy days. Unfortunately, I was expelled, <em>ahh</em> what a cherished memory… After the expulsion period ends, I will definitely create an even bigger human mountain.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was an absolutely savage sarcasm, and the group of people’s faces immediately soured. Being defeated by this devilish brat was said and done already, but they were also extorted, and lost so much face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Wu</span></i><span style>, could it be that you guys were the ones that I made a human mountain out of?” The little guy sounded suspicious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With these words spoken, the group of people’s faces became ugly beyond belief. The veins on the young people jumped, and even those few elders’ faces darkened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Hahaha…</span></i><span style>” The little guy laughed at the top of his voice and was incomparably overjoyed. It turns out that the people who were chasing after him had been beaten by him in the past.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laughing like this, it made the group of people’s complexions gloomy like water. They wanted to skin him alive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I get it now. The others who chased me must be like this as well, coming from the Four Great families. They were all people who were defeated by me, </span><i><span style>haha…</span></i><span style>” The little guy laughed extremely joyously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before, he was depressed. Why was he always being chased by others? Now, all of the tension was completely dispelled, after all, these were people that he had already beaten up before. Seeing the people he defeated before face to face really made him happy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This isn’t the Void God Realm’s Starting Ground, so our cultivation levels won’t be suppressed to such a low level. Just give up your life!” The green-robed man shouted. He was originally an elite from his generation, and among his peers, there were few who were worthy opponents. However, within the Void God Realm, he was actually cruelly beaten by someone and piled together with his clansmen; it truly was an extraordinary shame and humiliation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s not a big deal, you guys were defeated by me previously, and I thought you guys wouldn’t make it. If you don’t listen, then let’s go back and continue forming a human mountain.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a calamity of slaughter. The little guy was smiling mischievously, making this group of people all reveal a gloomy light within their eyes; it truly made them hateful and angry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little guy’s two hands continuously made seals, putting to use the symbols from the True Primordial Record. He drew out a golden wave that slashed its way over, colliding with that green-robed male's bone sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go up together, get rid of him!” Another young person walked up, making his move with everyone else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, several elders walked up. With each step, the ground would gently tremble. It was as if giants were walking, and their eyes were bright and resplendent like golden lamps.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hong</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>An intense and great battle erupted. The little guy fought with different people one after another, causing blood essence to roll over and over like waves. The symbols covering the sky were suffocating, pressing down as precious techniques attacked from all directions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His essence energy began to boil. Although his physical body was unparalleled, his symbols were not as powerful as those few elders’. He was shaken until a trickle of blood flowed out from the corners of his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With so many people making their moves together, they were definitely more than he could take on. The little guy shivered inwardly. These ‘restricted’ elders were definitely not ordinary people, and it was impossible for him to withstand. If he was surrounded here, he would definitely fall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He did not zealously continue fighting. He wiped off the bloodstain from the corner of his lips, and did not let them crowd around him. He was half fighting and half retreating.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young one, your innate talent is truly astonishing, but you’ve provoked people you shouldn’t have provoked. How can my Kun Clan tolerate your existence? Receive death!” shouted out an elder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They revealed their identity, because they determined that this youth was not going to live past this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little guy did not trade blows with them, and continuously received the elders’ suppressing symbols. Precious techniques poured over like an ocean wave, making blood once again flow out from the corners of his mouth. In the end, he used the golden bone shears to quickly rush into the mountain depths.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where are you going?!” How could the group of people agree to let him slip away? Several elders were standing on top of precious artifacts, leading the clan’s younger generation in pursuit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Scarlet liquid blocked their way, and fiery light surged about. The scene in front of them was terrifying. The mountain peak was thoroughly red, and the heat waves of the great earth were rolling about, forming magma.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little guy was standing on the golden bone shears as he crossed these vast rocky lands. His eyes were flickering with rays of light, and after glancing backwards, he began to increase his speed!</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the back, the group of people were coldly smiling. Their speeds were not inferior to the little guy’s, making it difficult for him to break away; sooner or later, they were going to catch up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Weren’t the other clans also offering a bounty? If we kill him and take away the precious artifacts on him, we can then turn his head in for the bounty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This devilish brat is truly hateful. Simply decapitating him would be letting him off too easy. We must torture him to death!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The group of people were extremely cold. They finally caught the devilish brat, so they were all thinking of ways to take his life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, the little guy turned around with a strange smile on his face. He raised his hand, revealing the Suan Ni precious mirror. He shone it towards the magma behind him, creating a fierce explosion. Lightning radiance dropped down streak after streak.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hong</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The heart of the magma raged, and billows soared into the heavens. The scarlet liquid’s temperature was shocking as they erupted high into the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He truly is a child. Does he really think that this magma can harm us?” An elder laughed coldly. With a flash of his precious artifact, he blocked off the surging scarlet wave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, his cold smile immediately froze. Everyone suddenly felt dreadful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A wave of terrifying aura rushed charged into the heavens, making every person tremble.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A crystalline pagoda bobbed up and down within the magma, surrounded by a lump of phoenix fire. It revealed its body, and then began to violently shake. It seemed as if it was incomparably angry as if erupted in a heaven overflowing radiance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Ah…</span></i><span style> No!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Kun Clansmen released blood-curdling screeches. They knew that they met a terrible calamity, because this precious artifact was too terrifying. It far surpassed their clan’s treasures, and was currently attacking them out of anger.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bubble</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The sound of precious artifacts shattering were emitted, and three of the elders’ precious artifacts shattered on the spot. All of them cried out miserably as they sank into the magma.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Flee quickly!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The green-robed male and the two other elders carried the people from their clans, and while stepping on their precious artifacts, they fled for their lives.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unfortunately, they were too close to the magma. Moreover, this bone pagoda was at the crucial point of its own refinement, and as a result of being disturbed, it madly displayed its might out of anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Another precious artifact cracked open, and the elder on top of it also exploded. The people beside him also fell into the magma.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The green-robed youth as well as another elder suffered heavy injuries. There was blood everywhere on their bodies, and their precious artifacts were almost destroyed. </span></p>
 <p><span style>What was rather unfortunate was that the little guy was waiting in front. He directly took out the golden bone shears, and with a </span><i><span style>pu</span></i><span style> sound, the two individuals were sliced at the waist, spraying out fresh blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So hateful!” The two of them were in despair. They were filled with unwillingness, dying at the magma’s shore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So terrifying!” The little guy stared at the sea of magma and felt a wave of dread.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just like this, he guarded this area for more than ten days. It had already been more than a month since he entered these Historical Ruins. The magma finally congealed, and the temperature here began to drop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Yi</span></i><span style>, the bone pagoda didn’t reappear?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little guy was in doubt. He walked around this region and carefully observed everything. In the end, he couldn’t hold himself back anymore and began to probe deeper.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He brought out the scarlet flying sword , drawing out a red streak and cutting deeply into the rocky ground. After searching carefully, there was still no fluctuations like before, and the bone pagoda did not rebel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Half a day later, the little guy personally got up and arrived at the area where the bone pagoda was rising and falling previously. After looking around carefully, he saw that this area had been dug out by the flying sword a long time ago. Pieces of shattered rocks were everywhere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With a </span><i><span style>dong</span></i><span style> sound, the ground rang out with a hollow sound. Moreover, there was a blaze that flickered before disappearing. The little guy was startled, and when he looked downward, he couldn’t help but reveal an astonished expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a pagoda there, and it absorbed the last of the flames. It became completely sparkling and transparent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This… Did it absorb all of the flames here?” There little guy was horrified. He quickly retreated, but noticed that the object below did not actually show any reaction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Yi,</span></i><span style> it changed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pagoda in the ground had all of its radiance restrained. It did not have a strange appearance, and was only the size of a palm. Moreover, it began to shrink, in the end becoming only the length of a finger. It was only about the size of a thumb when it stood up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little guy was shocked. After waiting for a really long time, he saw that it no longer had any changes. He released a stream of symbols to feel it out, and he got the same result. </span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, he retrieved the small pagoda and placed it at the center of his palm. It did not have the slightest reaction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The small pagoda was only an inch tall, and was roughly the size of a finger. Its entire body was transparent and crystalline, as if it was carved out of white jade, exceptionally beautiful. It did not seem like a precious artifact at all, instead seeming like a gorgeous piece of jewelry. It did not have any fearful aura at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little guy looked it over repeatedly, but could not feel any symbols at all. Following that, he used some divine force to try and activate the treasure, yet it still did not show any reaction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he did not see it himself personally, he definitely would have thought that this was a delicate and elegant object.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why isn’t it showing any reactions?” The little guy scratched his head. He was full of doubt, and after studying it for a really long time, he still didn’t have the slightest idea. In the end, he stuck it in his hair, truly using the pure white crystalline pagoda as a piece of jewelry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Several days later, the little guy arrived at the heart of the mountains. Along the way, he met over twenty precious artifacts, but he couldn’t subdue any of them. He truly felt that it was a pity, but there was one thing he was sure of, and that was that those precious artifacts weren’t as mysterious and terrifying as the bone pagoda.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unfortunately, the pagoda did not react to the little guy, and was just like a normal object.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a giant mountain at the center, and it was extremely massive. It was as if ten mountain peaks were merged together, and it was exceptionally grand and majestic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What a big mountain!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little guy sighed in admiration. Divine light flickered above the mountain, and precious artifacts would fly about from time to time. It was as if fireworks were blossoming, and they were all powerful spiritual objects.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the foot of the mountains, he saw a Bifang, Golden Divine Bird, Horned Dragon, Pixiu, Demonic Cattail Tree, Crack Demonic Butterfly, and other talents of that sort.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were people on top of the mountains long ago, and all of them had met by heavenly fate. This was the origin of the Historical Remains. It was known to have precious cliffs, and according to legend, this place was full of treasure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My sword… my sword…” Suddenly, the little guy heard an aged voice beside his ear, making him absolutely terrified. He replied in fear, “Ghost grandpa, don’t scare me. Didn’t you stay behind in the Heaven Mending Pavilion? Why do I hear your voice again?”</span></p>
