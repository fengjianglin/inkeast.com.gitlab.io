It was extremely hazy and beautiful.</span></p>

Even though it was said to be able to evolve, it would only turn into a top grade spiritual medicine. However, this one actually became a holy medicine!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao impatiently raised the fist sized pill furnace and looked inside. The gentle and sparkling bone precious furnace swirled with radiance and color inside. Several dozen types of precious medicines were surging with life force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He grabbed another stalk that was red like blood. It was a swallow that grew roots, one that looked like it was carved from a blood diamond. A rich medicinal fragrance was wafting out from it too.&nbsp;</span></p>

Could it be that they were all so heaven defying? He simply couldn't believe it. If they were all holy medicines or close to becoming holy medicines, it was enough to shock the higher realms. This ancient furnace was too extraordinary.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was starting to become suspicious. Could this fist sized furnace really have been carved from the bones of a True Dragon?</span></p>

This type of situation was difficult to make sense of. One had to understand that a single stalk of holy medicine could exchange the flesh and bones of a person between life and death. If one grasped one, then that was equivalent to having another life.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These types of precious medicines were extremely precious and rarely seen in the world. It was because after obtaining them, no one would exchange or sell them. They would all keep them to use for themselves.&nbsp;</span></p>

He grabbed towards the pill furnace again to see exactly what was inside. This pill furnace didn’t look bit, but it could contain mountains and rivers. The space within was extremely great.&nbsp;</span></p>

This was a spiritual medicine and not a holy medicine. This allowed Shi Hao to release a pent up breath, but it also left him feeling a bit disappointed.&nbsp;</span></p>

An earthen-colored old ginseng appeared. It was almost a human shape. It released a tempting fragrance from its brilliant body. It was another holy medicine -- golden ginseng!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This pill furnace’s master is formidable. If he wasn’t a divine medicinal master, then he is a great figure from an undying inheritance. His identity had to have been extraordinary!” The divine striking stone came to this conclusion.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Having two stalks of holy medicine and one stalk that is close to becoming holy medicine by his side was an extremely shocking thing.</span></p>

They could be called wondrous medicines, for example, the purple star grass, eternal flowing gold, and falling moonflower.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These types of wondrous medicines were extremely rare. If he used them for exchange, any one of them could be traded for many normal spiritual medicines.</span></p>

Normal spiritual medicines were still obtainable, but these rare wondrous medicines were harder to find. Meanwhile, what Stone Clan’s pill recipes needed the most were precisely these things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This solves a great problem of mine.” The meaning behind this discovery was extremely great for Shi Hao.</span></p>

He also wanted to use Stone Country’s formulas to baptise his flesh.&nbsp;</span></p>

Everything he collected were top quality goods. This furnace surged with divine multicolored radiance. These precious medicines that surged with auspicious light were priceless!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This truly is great natural luck, one that is inconceivable…” The divine striking stone said. Fishing up a pill furnace from the heavenly river actually produced such a great harvest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, both of them began to seriously suspect whether this fist sized furnace cauldron’s material was truly terrifying or not. It might be truly carved from some supreme true bone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao gently stroked it, and then he placed the lid back on properly. The medicinal fragrance vanished. He sat down and began to treat his injuries.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This experience had been extremely dangerous. Even though he fished up an ancient magical artifact, he himself suffered heavy injuries as well. There were cracks on his body, and he was covered in blood. A few of his bones were even broken.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One could see how terrifying the heavenly river was. One has to understand how incomparably terrifying Shi Hao’s flesh was. It was as sturdy as diamond, but he was still injured to this extent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fortunately, I didn’t try to fish up a divine corpse from the center of the later, or else even if a deity came, they would have still been killed!” Shi Hao said to himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His outer injuries still couldn’t be considered serious, but right now, the curse power was stirring within him, eroding his muscles and bones to destroy his dao foundation and core.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The good thing was that Shi Hao was still powerful enough himself, and he was quite experienced in dealing with curses. He sat down here, operating bone texts to neutralize the curse power.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, right when he was overcoming this curse and completely focusing on treatment, a streak of purple light flew over, striking the back of his head in a fierce and ruthless manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a scale the size of a palm, one that was incomparably sharp and even distorted the space around it. If it hacked towards one’s head, it would definitely be a fatal strike.</span></p>

His body quickly shifted sideways, avoiding this deadly strike. His entire body swirled with lightning radiance to protect himself.&nbsp;</span></p>

His body was stooped and he had a head full of white hair. His gaze was flickering with radiance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao felt a wave of anger inwardly. If his spiritual senses weren’t sharp enough, he definitely would have been killed right there. This elder was extremely powerful and not simple at all.</span></p>

It was aiding in Shi Hao’s protection, yet in the end, this type of elder came out of nowhere. It immediately shouted, “Old thing, do you still have any face, to attack someone of the younger generation?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The elder smiled and said, “This old one was just testing you guys a bit. You guys are extraordinary after all.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao didn’t say anything. He carefully observed the other party, and then he became more and more fearful. This old fellow’s face was covered in symbols. It was clear that this individual had already been deeply infected by the curse to the extent where it already endangered his life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was an expert that ignited his divine flame!&nbsp;</span></p>

If it wasn’t because of the other party’s curse, leaving his body in such a terrible state, he would be much more powerful than he was right now.&nbsp;</span></p>

Not long ago, he had the misfortune of dying in this heavenly river. Please return it,” said the elder. His smile was quite strong.&nbsp;</span></p>

Is your martial uncle an ancient person? The hidden attack just now is said and done already, but you still want to scheme for the pill furnace. Why don’t you just get lost?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Shi Hao fished up the pill furnace, lightning radiance rushed into the heavens, creating quite a commotion, startling this creature that had ignited its divine flame and allowing him to secretly notice it.&nbsp;</span></p>

I ask you to please return it.” The elder said, walking forward. A bit of divine flame radiated around him.</span></p>

His cultivation was extremely great, and his reactions were fast, but he still couldn’t dodge it.</span></p>

In addition, his hair began to stand up one after another, becoming a bit scorched. This was caused by the electricity.</span></p>

Even though he suffered from the power of the curse, making his strength drop greatly, he still found this result hard to accept.&nbsp;</span></p>

His eyes immediately shone.</span></p>

A purple-robed youth walked over. There were a few others who followed him, all of their faces covered in symbols after suffering heavily from the curse.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao recognized them. This was precisely the conceited Taotie Clan youth he saw when they first emerged on Fiend Island. His cultivation was strong, and his goal had been to reach the immortal tomb.&nbsp;</span></p>

It was similar to the length of a finger, soft and shining. A pure white holy light was shining from it.&nbsp;</span></p>

This was one of the world’s most precious plants. It had the power to ward off evil spirits and known to not be infected by anything vile. It could fight curses.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This type of thing was extremely rare, with one stalk being found only after many years had passed. It couldn’t be grown, so one could only rely on the world to naturally produce it.&nbsp;</span></p>

The Taotie Clan youth’s hands had one that had thirteen division. One shouldn’t look down on it because it was only a meter in length, because it had already grown for six thousand five hundred years.</span></p>

Otherwise, they would have long died from being infected by the curse.</span></p>

In addition, the bamboo was covered in cracks. The divine effects were weakening; it was going to break apart soon.&nbsp;</span></p>

In the end, when they saw that the precious bamboo was damaged, they had no choice but to return. Along the way back, they just happened to see Shi Hao fish up the pill furnace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This pill furnace is quite mysterious and extremely unordinary.” An elder next to the purple robed youth said.</span></p>

Hurry up and offer up the precious furnace, and then I might be able to leave you with your life.” The Taotie Clan youngster said coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His mood was utterly terrible. He used one of his clan’s divine treasures, yet in the end, he couldn’t reach the divine tomb. It made him incomparably angry. Now that he saw this type of natural luck on the way back, he was naturally going to seize it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you not know that acting overbearing leads to death?!” The divine striking stone loudly berated. It was extremely angry.&nbsp;</span></p>

They had two experts with their divine flames ignited here, and it was enough to deal with Shi Hao.</span></p>

His face was covered in curse symbols, making the smile on his face appear extremely strange. “Do not overestimate yourself.”</span></p>

He moved his hand, hinting for them to attack and kill Shi Hao as soon as possible. He didn’t want to waste any time here.</span></p>

However, he didn’t attack their group, but instead sent a fist towards the river.&nbsp;</span></p>

Even if they used supreme precious artifacts to defend against the lightning radiance, they still couldn’t protect themselves from the curse power. It would provoke a great disaster.&nbsp;</span></p>

He immediately lifted the cover of the pill furnace, and then he rushed inside with the divine striking stone. Then, he activated the precious furnace and ran.&nbsp;</span></p>

Then, he raised the purple robed youth before saying, “I still haven’t eaten Taotie meat yet. I’ll get rid of your flesh in a bit and then have a taste. Of course, this is on the premise that hurry and show me your original form. Otherwise, I won’t be able to bring myself to eat you.”</span></p>
