Before they traveled that far, he saw a stalk of vine at the base of a mountain that took root between the cracks of the stone. It had multicolored light swirling about it.</span></p>

A streak of scarlet multicolored light quickly rushed over, and then a miserable cry sounded. This cultivator that could be considered quite powerful as well widened his eyes, showing fear. His face gazed into the skies as he collapsed into a pool of blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a scarlet feather arrow. It pierced through his skull, killing him on the spot, fierce and accurate. A single arrow took his life, not leaving him with any chance.</span></p>

None of them dared to say anything and they held it all in, because they noticed there were many figures up ahead. There were a few others, clearly Fire Devil Palace’s experts.&nbsp;</span></p>

Fire Devil Palace was too overbearing and ruthless, but this also meant that there was definitely something incredible up ahead that made this sect feel so nervous.</span></p>

Towards any divine level expert, he wouldn’t underestimate them, let alone the fact that there were more than one. He had to deal with them carefully.&nbsp;</span></p>

Ancient trees were sparse and thinly spread. One could look very far into the distance. This place was full of spiritual essence, but there weren’t many poisonous bugs or ferocious beasts. It was a relatively peaceful pure land.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao stood on top of a tall mountain and gazed into the distance. The heart of this region was a vast and boundless mountain valley. It was incredibly majestic. Purple energy rose, surging upwards. It was as if there were draconic cries that sounded. It was an extremely unordinary and unique place.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What a precious land. What is there inside?” Shi Hao said softly.&nbsp;</span></p>

There were many people watching the surroundings as well, strictly locking down this place.&nbsp;</span></p>

He only walked a few dozen li, but was already blocked. There was a great formation sealing the skies!</span></p>

This area of a hundred li was completely surrounded by an ancient divine level formation with not faults. He couldn’t free himself from this place.</span></p>

It was because this was a sealed earth that was separated from the outside world. Even if there were vicious beasts of divine birds, they couldn’t come in.</span></p>

However, they quickly suffered disasters. There were several people who were killed by the symbols, making everyone’s expressions change. Forcefully trying to break out was definitely no good.&nbsp;</span></p>

Scarlet light rushed into the air. An enormous Scarlet Feathered Crane rushed out. Half of its body was burning, and blood covered it. It fell outside the mountain valley.</span></p>

Fire Devil Palace’s expert that ignited its divine flame suffered serious injuries in the valley. However, they didn’t dare to act recklessly. There should be more than a single divine level expert that came.&nbsp;</span></p>

He was extremely handsome, only, he was a bit feminine. His eyes were long and and slender. With a smile that was yet not a smile, he looked over and said, “You should leave. My martial uncle has summoned you all.”</span></p>
