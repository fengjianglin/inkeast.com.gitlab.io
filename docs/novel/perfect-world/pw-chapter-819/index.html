They originally wanted to see if they could use the immortal bone in Qin Hao’s body to save their eldest child, yet after a moment of hesitation, they missed the opportunity. In the end, the eldest son actually removed his own bone and gave it to their second son.</span></p>

He had never been properly cared for since he was young, and he even suffered that kind of wrong. He experienced endless torment, yet in the end, he was going to lay in the ice cold grave alone in the lower realm. They weren’t even able to accompany him afterwards.</span></p>

All of the cultivators of the higher realms that were able to come were pretty much staring at him right now. ‘Attention of ten thousand eyes’ was far from being enough to describe this.&nbsp;</span></p>

Aren’t you guys known to be killing dao cultivators, your assassination methods unmatched?
