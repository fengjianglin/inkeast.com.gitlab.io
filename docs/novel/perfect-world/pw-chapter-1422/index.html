 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two Self Severing Realm experts were killed this quickly. The fine hairs of everyone in Jadefall Island stood on end, feeling deeply shocked. Just how powerful was Huang?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You…” In the distance, Wang Xi pointed at Shi Hao, unable to say anything. Her grandfather was extremely powerful, yet Huang killed him right after saying he would do so, doing it in a clean and direct manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I will kill you!” Jin Zhan shouted, long hair flying about, eyebrows standing on end, eyes filled with blood. When he opened his mouth, bone texts formed a starry stream, smashing towards Shi Hao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A mouthful of innate stellar force mixed with primal chaos, known to be able to strike down the sun and moon was refined to the peak, hacking down the star dome, slicking apart the cosmos, none of this a problem!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Come back!” Suddenly, a voice was transmitted from behind. Moreover, a spatial gate was opened, A sparkling blue large hand reached out, grabbing Jin Zhan with a&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">peng</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;sound, bringing him away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone here was stunned. They thought that Jin Zhan might go crazy, fight a battle to the death with Shi Hao, never expecting him to be directly seized. Needless to say, that was definitely someone from Jin Family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone felt relieved. It was definitely because a great figure was paying close attention. Now, the situation had already developed to such a complicated state, Jin Family wanted to temporarily remove themselves from this matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Regardless of whether they would pursue Shi Hao for killing a cultivator from their clan, that was something that would come later, they didn’t want to become the focal point of this storm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the very least, the ones badly burned should be Wang Family, even more unlucky than the Jin Family, actually about to lose three Lightning Spirits. This loss was unimaginable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These things were too precious, rarely seen in this world, not many of them existing from past until now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the present world, not even supreme level figures believed that there were things like Lightning Spirits in existence. Now, their existence was proved, living examples seen, so how could they not be shocked?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was definitely a tremendous matter!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, as one of the main characters, Shi Hao could actually subdue the Lightning Spirits, this left everyone even more shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Huang is too strong! I thought that I was already rating him highly, but only now have I discovered that he is even stronger than what I imagined!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lightning Spirits, they were known to be unmatched creatures, yet they were actually defeated, moreover three of them. One had to understand that they even dared to resist lightning tribulation, able to eat it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone could see Huang’s battle accomplishments with their own eyes, leaving all of them alarmed. They finally knew why he could defeat ten kings alone in Scarlet Sky Border.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wang Family and Jin Family’s two experts were actually easily killed. Huang was too fast!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What about Jin Zhan? Didn’t you say that you are number one in present world methods? Why did you leave? If you have the guts, then come here and fight Huang!” Someone shouted, creating a disturbance here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After suffering the initial shock, then composing themselves again, a few young cultivators were partial to Shi Hao, holding Wang Family’s actions in contempt. They naturally didn’t see Jin Zhan’s family in a favorable light either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was especially true regarding Wang Family, actually releasing such terrifying creatures while Shi Hao was crossing tribulation, harming his magical body, seizing his dao fruit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now, news had already gone out, many people understanding what kind of thing the Lightning Spirits were. While feeling shock, they also felt fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were only three chopstick length bugs, yet they could actually devour lightning radiance, harm one’s dao fruit. They got stronger through heavenly tribulation, needing to ingest Lightning Tribulation Liquid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fairy Wang Xi, your Wang Family has gone too far, right?” Someone spoke out, berating Wang Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her face was pale, feeling great shock towards Shi Hao’s fighting strength, and also shaken from her grandfather’s death. Right now, she was a bit absent-minded, when she heard this, her eyes recovered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fairy Wang Xi, why aren’t you inviting your fiance Jin Zhan to fight? Fighting honorably is better than releasing Lightning Spirits to harm one’s dao fruit, right? We should see who is stronger and who is weaker!” Someone said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The public will naturally have its own opinion on the matter.” Right at this time, a spatial gate opened, flowing with hazy radiance. Bone texts appeared streak after streak, bringing Wang Xi away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Family didn’t send out any experts, because if they sent someone out in this type of situation, take action, it would definitely provoke the extraordinary figures in Imperial Pass.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For example, Great Elder Meng Tianzheng, he should have already come out, to the extent where he might even take action against Wang Family’s five dragons!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone could clearly see that the Lightning Spirits have shifted owners. They couldn’t be taken back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It really pains me to death!” Someone from Wang Family shouted, but his voice was suppressed extremely low, not daring to let others hear. This was a type of suppressed howl.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was because they lost an unmatched type of creature. If they were properly raised, they would become something the clan could rely on, but in the end, they were lost just like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Who would have expected that the powerful Lightning Spirits who possessed innate superiority in lightning tribulation were discovered by Huang, unable to even launch a hidden assault on him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this time, the battles in the distance were extremely intense. The Emperor Butterfly fought against two creatures, one gold, one silver, the scene shocking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It gently swayed its wings, great void cracks extending out who knew how many li, the entire heavens looking like it was going to collapse, making all experts feel alarmed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This fella previously absorbed the essence of an ancient Emperor Butterfly, transforming for several years, the benefits it obtained were unimaginable after all!” Cao Yusheng said with a sigh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He understood this matter, but he was still shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within the cave the ancient Emperor Butterfly resided in, there was previously an ancient key that was obtained by Shi Hao. it was precisely because of it that he obtained the Imperishable Scripture in the Northern Sea’s Imperishable Mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thinking back, there was a reason behind why the cave the Emperor Butterfly was in had that type of thing. The Emperor Butterfly itself was too terrifying!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, the Emperor Butterfly was a bit angered. Previously, it already crushed the two Lightning Spirits beneath its golden wings, seizing the advantage, but it never expected these two creatures to be this terrifying, not bowing down after all this time, fighting with everything they had.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qiang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Emperor Butterfly looked gentle, dancing lightly and gracefully, but its attack power really was too frightening. The golden butterfly wings hacked down, sparks flying everywhere, leaving behind terrifying injuries on the silver Lightning Spirit’s body, its flesh damaged, blood falling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Lightning Spirits’ bodies were unbreaking, apart from Shi Hao, at this level, it was extremely difficult for others to injure them. Now, the Emperor Butterfly actually accomplished this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That golden Lightning Spirit offered support, a streak of golden lightning shooting out of its mouth, accompanied by chaotic energy, even having wisps of immortal mist. This left everyone who saw this scene shocked!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is immortal mist that has merged with the flesh, lightning accompanied by a mouthful of blood. This type of creature… is too frightening! It has immortal dao strength?!” A few people cried out in alarm, stupefied as they watched, bodies a bit cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sure enough, the lightning supported by the blood of the Lightning Spirit was even more powerful, blasting aside the Emperor Butterfly. The silver-colored Lightning Spirit broke free.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two Lightning Spirits shouted out, incredibly angry. They both displayed their might, stirring on lightning. They turned into streaks of divine radiance, one gold, one silver, rushing into the heavens and diving into the earth, fighting a bloody battle against the Emperor Butterfly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This battle was too intense, drawing everyone’s attention.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many people harbored suspicions. Just what kind of butterfly was this? How could it be this formidable?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Someone said the name Emperor Butterfly, but those who knew about it were too few, not many knowing about its past battle accomplishments.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was because this thing was too rare, only appearing once in archaic times, moreover entering the lower realm, the records pertaining to it too rare.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There is a possibility that it is just like the protectors, not belonging to this world, originating from a distant and ancient place!” Someone said quietly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The protectors bloodline of the Nine Heavens Ten Earths, Dugu Yun’s ancestors were suspected to not belong to this world, having another place of origin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qiang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The pair of butterfly wings were golden and brilliant, sweeping through everything before it. In the end, it seized the advantage again, fighting the two alone, overwhelming the Lightning Spirits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone was speechless, at the same time extremely shocked. This Emperor Butterfly was too powerful, even able to suppress the unmatched Lightning Spirits, this type of race was just too strange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One had to understand that this was a creature that followed Shi Hao, staying with him. Being able to subdue Lightning Spirits himself was one thing, yet a golden butterfly that followed him could also do this!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This…” Many people were shocked, finding it difficult to express what they were feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If they were to grow up, just how terrifying would they become? The creatures at Shi Hao’s side would definitely be of the highest level of strength, in the future, they could suppress all directions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Lightning Spirits were subdued!” Someone cried out in alarm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the battle continued for a long time, reaching more than four hundred moves, the Emperor Butterfly subdued the two Lightning Spirits. One wing suppressed one, pressing them down, they weren’t able to move at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao smiled, walking over from the lightning tribulation, applying seals on the two Lightning Spirits himself. He placed them together with the one from before, putting them away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn’t kill them, feeling like this type of thing had great uses. If he could take them for himself, they would definitely be powerful battle servants!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With things like this, none of the individuals present could calm down. This place erupted with noise, many people discussing fervently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Shi Hao didn’t pay attention to these things. He sat down in the lightning pool, completely refining all of the Lightning Tribulation Liquid he hadn’t absorbed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, he entered the tenth layer of heaven to seize the final true lightning pool!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There is another lightning pool?!” When the group of youngsters saw this, they all felt like they were a bit dizzy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course there was a Tenth Heaven. It was high up above, a space created from divine light. The lightning there wasn’t violent, but extremely gentle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, when Shi Hao entered, wishing to seize the lightning pool, the auspicious became sinister. Lightning flashed, thunder rumbled, crazy winds sweeping about, the attacks ferocious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao remained unmoved, resisting with all of his strength, rushing over with extreme speed, instantly arriving by the lightning pool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This pool was extremely small, less than a square foot in size. However, the power of the liquid inside was too exuberant, who knew how many times stronger than that of the pool below.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn’t say anything, instead producing a bone cauldron, then quickly collecting it, not daring to waste time out of fear that something unexpected would happen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The liquid was red and sparkling like a large ruby, also like heaven and earth essence blood. The power within was too great, absolutely priceless!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, this pool was extremely simple and ancient, when he felt it with his hand, Shi Hao was shocked. This was clearly made from ancient rock, not feeling like it was produced from lightning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Since this liquid is real, then the pool, could it be that it has a chance of being real too? Can I bring this pool away with me?” Shi Hao said to himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This lightning pool was different from those of the past, it was too real, the stone sturdy, filled with an ancient aura, having a type of special immortal dao energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll move it, just come with me then!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao exerted force, using his great divine abilities, wishing to bring this pool away, put it into his storage magical artifacts so he could research it later.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the distance, everyone who saw this scene was speechless. Just how greedy was Huang? Seizing the Lightning Tribulation Liquid was one thing, yet he was even going to bring the pool away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Normally speaking, no one could obtain an entire pool of liquid. In the past, when Shi Hao was crossing tribulation, he had experienced this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, just now, the lightning pool of the Ninth Heaven was an exception, because that wasn’t the ultimate natural luck of this heavenly tribulation.</span></p>
