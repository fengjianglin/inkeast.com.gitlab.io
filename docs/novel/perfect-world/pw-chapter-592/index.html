Aren’t you just saying that out of anger?” Huang Yu laughed faintly. He carried a small golden hammer that crackled with lightning in his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao sighed. He looked into the sky towards the horizon. That was the direction where Stone Village rested. Would he still be able to go back after this battle? Would he be able to see those people again?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then, he looked into the void, wishing he could peer through the world and say a few final sentences to his parents who were in Immortal Mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was silent, feeling rather disappointed and confused. He was actually forced into this situation. After this battle, would there still be a little Stone in this world?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are so young, and your natural talents are so unordinary. Having you die here really is quite a pity. I really will give you the option of staying alive, as long as you serve me for a hundred years.” The corners of Huang Yu’s lips revealed a faint smile as he spoke.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Today, if it isn’t you that dies, then it’s me that will!” Shi Hao’s voice resounded through the air. His gaze was incredibly fierce.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why do you insist on going about things the wrong way… Truly lamentable. Since you wish to die, then I’ll carry out your wish!” Huang Yu spoke with a ridiculing tone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He then rushed downwards, displaying all types of methods. Even though he looked calm on the outside, he was still extremely careful, fearing that Shi Hao truly had some special methods.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was someone who was naturally careful. Even though his cultivation was extremely high and he possessed great strength, he wasn’t willing to show any carelessness towards this younger generation youth Shi Hao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Endless lightning radiance streaked across the sky. When the small golden hammer struck down, it was as if the entire mountain range was submerged in electricity!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Kacha!</span></p>

Rubble flew through the sky, and all types of mountain bodies continuously collapsed, collapsing into ashes and broken pieces.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Endless lightning interweaved into an ocean. The rumbling sounds shook all of Fire Nation. This was an absolutely astonishing scene!</span></p>

Huang Yu used all types of divinie abilities. He turned into his original body, spreading his Immortal Crane wings and filling the sky with golden feathers. They turned into divine arrows, and all of them shot towards Shi Hao’s flesh.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hong!</span></p>

These were all formed from the natural laws of gold. There were divine flames burning about on every single pillar. Countless symbols could be seen here.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao released a long roar. All types of true deity weapons were activated at the same time to defend against this attack. This place immediately erupted into chaos.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The decisive battle between both sides made heaven and earth lose color. The changes that were taking place in this place were absolutely astonishing. One could see the blazing radiance from several hundred li out, almost covering the sun.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pu!</span></p>

It almost tore apart Shi Hao’s neck. Several terrifying wounds that were dripping with blood were left behind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The imperishable golden body battle clothes lacked protection in areas close to his face. Even this small weakness was taken advantage of by Huang Yu, almost killing the little Stone through it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao widened his eyes in anger. He activated the magical sword and used it to continuously strike the golden claws. Thunderous sounds rang through the air.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the distance, many experts were alarmed. They moved closer, witnessing the terrifying divine might that was rippling outwards as well as the chaotic skies for themselves. They were all stupefied and frightened.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The little Stone came to my Fire Nation and is fighting the last deity! I truly hope he can win!”</span></p>

That deity was too powerful. After igniting his divine flame, his body was resplendent with radiance. With a wave of his hand, the entire world would resonate in response. How was one supposed to fight against this type of power?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Peng!</span></p>

His ears and eyes also had scarlet liquid trickling out from them. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The situation was dire. Shi Hao was doing everything he could, but he still couldn’t contend against this opponent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hand over your life!” Huang Yu shouted. Another magical artifact unexpectedly appeared in his hands, a golden fan made of feathers. With a ferocious fan, a great hurricane emerged.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This type of wind was too terrifying. It was golden in color, immediately blasting several dozen mountain peaks into ashes. Anything that made contact with it would inevitably turn into ashes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This really was a scalp numbing power.&nbsp;</span></p>

Even though he had deity level magical artifacts protecting him, he still flew outwards. His flesh trembled greatly. Blood flowed out from his mouth. This time, he was swept up by the great winds, making him fly out who knew how many li.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yi</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">, you still want to escape? You should just die here!” Huang Yu cried out. His gaze was cold, and killing intent surged. There was no point in hiding anything now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao really was fleeing. He wanted to get a bit closer to Stone Country, maybe even take one last look at Stone Village if possible. There were too many great memories in that place, and every time he thought about it, he would always feel great warmth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only, he knew that there was no way he could get close to it.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This vicious bird’s thoughts were always meticulous. He was just too careful and difficult to deal with.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You wish to die in Stone Country?” Huang Yu smiled coldly. He could tell what Shi Hao was thinking. He was fleeing while coughing blood, wishing to enter Stone Country’s borders.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao didn’t pay him any attention. However, he continuously lost blood, and his injuries worsened greatly.&nbsp;</span></p>

He stepped on the altar, opening a passageway and disappearing from Fire Nation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The little Stone’s great battle affected two countries. The most crucial moment has arrived. Who can offer him a hand?!” News transmitted outwards from Fire Nation, creating a huge commotion.&nbsp;</span></p>

He wished for Shi Hao to continue fleeing until he ran out of strength to save him some effort. He was naturally mistrustful in nature, fearing that Shi Hao might have some special methods.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Three Life Mountain… I’ve arrived.” Shi Hao said softly. His body was already dyed red with blood. He unexpectedly returned to this mountain range again. He had previously cultivated for a period of time in isolation here.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He looked towards Stone Village, quiet and lost in his thoughts. Then, he said to himself, “Father, mother, I don’t know if we can ever see each other again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finally, he looked towards the heavens and said, “I haven’t fought into the higher realms yet, unable to compete against those exceptional talents and heavenly geniuses. I am truly unwilling to accept this fate…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Huang Yu caught up. He rushed forward murderously, and with a cold smile, he said, “You can go on your way.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You go on your way first!” Shi Hao said, his voice cold and resolute.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In addition, right at this moment, endless fiery light erupted from his entire body, as if he immediately ignited the heavens. It was so brilliant that even the sun became dim in comparison.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A mysterious and powerful energy rippled outwards, engulfing all directions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao rushed towards Huang Yu. In his surroundings, ten heavenly passages burned, linking together. Another abnormal fluctuation rippled outwards, filling the air with a terrifying energy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Live sacrifice!” He released a light shout that rumbled like thunder.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was no way. He had to use his life in exchange. While fleeing, he continuously stored up power, ammassing strength all for the sake of erupting at this moment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Live sacrifice. When Shi Hao opened his ten heavenly passages back then, he had stepped foot into it before in the past. At that time, even the Willow Deity was startled, stating that this contained a power that could damage the harmony of heaven.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only, how could it be that easy to live sacrifice a deity? This was especially true when the deity was as powerful as Huang Yu. It would be even more difficult to deal with.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Using oneself as a live sacrifice, using that as a primer to then offer the other party as a live sacrifice!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao rushed towards Immortal Palace’s old servant. A pair of Kun Peng wings moved about, increasing his speed to the fastest it had ever been his entire life.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You…” Huang Yu was horrified. When the ten great heavenly passages ignited, it was as if they could burn through anything. It made his heavenly passages resonate in response to sacrifice them as well. He naturally had to retreat.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ten great heavenly passages linked up. After the live sacrifice, they became even more different, forming a domain that surrounded this place. It was unexpectedly merging with the old servant, making it difficult for him to flee. It was as if he had been caught in a swamp.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was still because he was powerful. If it was anyone else, they would have long been confined in place without being able to budge an inch.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hou…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huang Yu roared, his gray hair flying about chaotically as he struggled intensely. He didn’t want to be sacrificed alive together with another person like this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ten great heavenly passages linked up together and burned furiously. This was a flaring of life force. After being supported by the imperishable golden body battle clothes, the power of this live sacrifice was terrifying to the extreme. It could definitely set the heavenly passages of a deity aflame!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Suppress!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huang Yu shouted loudly. He was truly anxious now, because right now, some of his heavenly passages had been forced to appear. They were going to be sacrificed together and burned through.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Around him, the small golden hammer, golden fan, other weapons, as well as the thumb ring on his hand emerged. They all shone to suppress Shi Hao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rise!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao shouted loudly. The broken sword, country protecting divine halberd, beast skin, and other true deity magical artifacts also appeared to hold off those weapons. He offered himself as a living sacrifice, and he was going to pull Huang Yu down with him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once this began, it was incredibly difficult to survive. It would be hard for him to make it out of this alive.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was only a single line of life, and even at the most crucial point, he might not necessarily be able to grab it. After all, the one he was dealing with was a deity. If he didn’t offer himself as a living sacrifice, how was he supposed to sacrifice the other party?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huang Yu became anxious. He continuously muttered to himself, chanting incantations. Finally, he shouted, “Immortal Palace descend!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An indistinct void image appeared, originating from his body. There was a majestic and boundless aura being exuded. It suppressed towards Shi Hao to destroy his body and completely wipe out the flames.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This type of divine might was utterly terrifying!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What is this? Shi Hao was astonished.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The void image gradually condensed. It was a bronze immortal palace that was incomparably large and imposing. It carried a terrifying pressure with it, as if the force of the immortal dao was falling down.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is the void image of my Immortal Palace. A great one imparted it onto my body. I never expected that I would truly have to use it here.” Huang Yu’s face became pale as he said in a downcast manner.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao was astonished. This was Immortal Palace? It actually had substance in the higher realm and wasn’t just the name of an organization. It was made of bronze. Even though it was an indistinct void image, it gave off great and boundless profound mysteries.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In addition, there were many void figures in its surroundings. They were all bronze palaces, and they were linked together. Only, they weren’t as large or clear as this one.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pu!</span></p>

He bled from all seven apertures. His body was on the verge of collapsing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It was originally already a situation of nine deaths and one life, but there was a shred of hope. Now it seems like that shred of hope is going to disappear too…” Shi Hao said to himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You should just calmly go on your way! There is no shame in dying under the void image of Immortal Palace. This is the immortal dao’s supreme treasure!” Huang Yu sneered. He now calmed down.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Just an insignificant void image, yet you want to suppress me with it? Aren’t you ridiculing me a bit too much? If I can live, there will be a day when I go to the higher realms and destroy the real bronze immortal palace!” Shi Hao said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Huang Yu carried a mocking sneer as he said, “Just with you? No way! You will also never have this chance. Your life can just end right here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then ten deaths and no life it shall be…” When Shi Hao reached this point, he raised his voice, shaking the heavens with his roar. “However, I will bring you down with me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Keep dreaming!” Huang Yu’s mind jumped. He took precautions and began to back up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Supreme being bone, open for me!” Shi Hao roared. At this moment, his entire body shone, especially his chest area. Endless light drowned out this place.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the final moment before destruction, Shi Hao’s expression became calm again. He said softly to himself, “Stone Village, I really want to go back and look at you all one more time, but I can’t. Also, father, mother, I have just met you two and had a reunion, but in the end, we have to part ways again… I am truly unwilling…”</span></p>
