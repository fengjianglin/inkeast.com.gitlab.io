His face revealed his greatly stirred up emotions, but there was also a perplexed expression. Those two figures had appeared in his dreams before, but he had always been left with regret in reality.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A father or a mother, for others, were the closest family members. They were often at one’s side, protecting them and helping them grow. For him, however, it was a type of desire. From childhood until now, he had never seen them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The little Stone was stunning, rising up within the savage wastelands, relying on himself to walk out from the great mountains and forming an illustrious reputation. He could look down on his peers. Even though he didn’t have the support of his parents, he still similarly showed disdain for those of his generation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he still longed for them, his heart always feeling bitterness. Today, he was finally going to meet them and mend the piece of his heart that was missing. He wished to experience that type of familial love.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All types of light rose from the ground. Symbols flickered, releasing a divine aura. Shi Hao was astonished. This was a heaven connecting formation that locked down the valley.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Father!” Shi Hao shouted.</span></p>

Even though they had been separated for so many years, his heart had never rejected them, nor did they feel unfamiliar. It was still like before. Those figures had left too great of an impression on his memory.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The voice echoed greatly throughout the valley, as if heavenly thunder was rumbling. However, those two figures still did not show any response.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It is the power of the formation. It separates everything in there. You can see inside, but they can’t see what’s outside.” In his hair, the divine striking stone spoke.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Can you break the formation?” Shi Hao asked. He had long become agitated inside, and he truly wished to barge in as soon as he could to appear in front of those two.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is a divine formation. The difficulty is too great! I need time. You have to understand that breaking through this formation requires more than just technique. One also needs corresponding strength,” said the divine striking stone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Behind him, the two supreme experts closed in and decisively took action. It was because Qin Zhang was in Shi Hao’s hands and could die at any time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In addition, they could tell that the little Stone was seizing the rebirth secret technique from the flickering symbols of the holy liquid and was about to obtain everything. This was definitely not something that could be passed outwards.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">You have to understand that even they only obtained a small ruined piece of this technique. This type of sect guarding secret art was something only a select few could cultivate. It was a secret that could not be leaked outside the sect.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A Zhujian that was powerful and sinister was formed. It pounced forward. It was formed from symbols and right now, it was rushing at Shi Hao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, the other individual’s entire body burned. He quickly produced more than a hundred formations. They were like majestic stars as they appeared at his side, dazzling and brilliant.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, Qin Hao also attacked. The dao techniques flowed naturally with his every movement, and the silver spear in his hands released&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">wu wu</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;sounds. It turned into a resplendent streak of silver light as it flew over.&nbsp;</span></p>

A vermilion bird soared above the nine heavens. Scarlet flames surged around Shi Hao as the Archaic Vermilion Bird’s Four-Fold Barrage was displayed!</span></p>

After all, he knew how dangerous it was inside the valley. He wouldn’t act carelessly with a great opponent in front of him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Burning hot flames surged, and it was as if this place was flooded with scarlet magma. It blasted into the heavens together with the vermilion bird’s cries.&nbsp;</span></p>

However, both of them were blocked, and it was difficult to get past.&nbsp;</span></p>

They both took action, grabbing this silver lance together and activating it with their strength. It was as if a silver true dragon raised its head and roared into the nine heavens.&nbsp;</span></p>

The golden magical sword sliced out again, and blazing golden light seemed to sever the void as an eternal streak of divine radiance slashed out to suppress heaven and earth .</span></p>

It was as if a vast body of water broke through a dam. It was enough to sweep through endless mountains and destroy mountain ranges. This was an undying divine might!</span></p>

On the other side, the three individuals all took steps backwards in shock. The power of that golden magical sword was glorious and terrifying.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Doesn’t matter. His magical sword is Stone Clan’s country guarding divine weapon. It is not because his strength is unrivalled under the heavens.” An elder explained to the youth beside him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your age is still small and your blood and qi have not flourished yet. Your dao path still needs time to develop experience. There will be a day sooner or later when you will become unrivalled under the heavens.” Another elder spoke.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, their old faces were deeply red. Qin Hao was no match, but there was a reason for that. He was still too young. However, the two of them were already quite old, yet they were forced back. There was no excuse for this, and they were truly ashamed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, sheets of light rose one after another. It was dazzling and alarming. Great energy poured out majestically, and it was as if a great sun was rising. This place was filled with the aura of a deity.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The great one has awoken!” An elder cheered. He was full of reverence and excitement.&nbsp;</span></p>

This wasn’t any secret. This was the place where the Immortal Mountain’s ancestor cultivated in isolation. It was one of the family’s secret places.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A sigh sounded. It was clearly soft, yet it was like a powerful stream current that blasted into the high heavens. It left everyone greatly shaken.&nbsp;</span></p>

It is a place of peace and happiness, so how can blades and war be here? Shameful.” This voice was soft, but it carried a type of attractiveness. It was not one of anger, but it made the souls of those present tremble.&nbsp;</span></p>

Shi Hao’s mind was rising and falling chaotically. This was the first time he faced one like this.&nbsp;</span></p>

He came for his parents and had to meet them.&nbsp;</span></p>

He still carried Qin Zhan, his left hand carrying out the final extraction from the holy liquid to seize the remaining symbols.&nbsp;</span></p>

Even if a deity was nearby, he would still continue to seize its origin imprint.&nbsp;</span></p>

This was the gate of enlightenment Shi Hao extracted. It formed a passage of great dao.&nbsp;</span></p>

After being suppressed by Shi Hao, he was able to completely extract it without missing a single part.&nbsp;</span></p>

The secret art wasn’t that long. It engraved itself in the void, forming a heaven and earth text. Each character blossomed with multicolored light, as if they were dao symbols formed from metal.&nbsp;</span></p>

It appeared in his mind one character after another, releasing the rumbling of the great dao.&nbsp;</span></p>

If you are willing, I can even guide you in some other sect guarding precious techniques.” Within the depths of the valley, golden mists swirled about. It was as brilliant as the multicolored clouds of sunrise; this was the aura of a deity.&nbsp;</span></p>

You’ve already come, so is there any need to worry about not seeing them?” The voice was drawn out and distant. It carried the feeling of great changes, leaving Shi Hao with a deep impression that was hard to forget.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When these words stopped, a golden streak of light appeared.

Not even they had experienced such a thing. This path was allegedly formed from the force of a deity. It contained the great dao’s true profoundness, and walking on it would allow one to easily comprehend the dao.&nbsp;</span></p>
