Broken pieces of the bowl were everywhere. It was a mess.&nbsp;</span></p>

This life-saving method made her heart shake. They had to use their second son’s bone to save their eldest son, how could this be?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Ziling was also stupefied. He slowly calmed his heart and then asked, “Great doctor, are there any other methods apart from this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Zhang Zhong shook his head. Even though he specialized in the art of healing, understanding profound symbols and secret methods, he still couldn't cure Shi Hao’s injuries.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then this… wouldn’t it bring great problems to the other child?” Qin Yining asked with a trembling voice.&nbsp;</span></p>

There was perhaps only one way to cure Shi Hao, and that was to put the immortal bone into his body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Great doctor, is there truly no other way?” Shi Ziling frowned. He naturally understood what the other party meant. The so-called drawing support from the immortal bone was definitely a transplantation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The risks involved in doing this were too great. For their second son, it was extremely dangerous. If an accident happened, there might even be fatal danger.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This old one’s skills are already poor. It was just a random thought.” Zhang Zhong said. These things were hard for him to speak about too, because the effects were too terrifying. It affected the futures of two youths.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How could this be? Why is life so cruel? Hao’er…” Qin Yining cried, feeling incomparably emotional as she hugged the eldest son on the bed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao’s state was extremely terrible. From time to time, he would be clear-headed, and other times, he would faint. There were many bronze stain symbols in his body that brought him intense pain and devoured at his life force.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, his spiritual will separated from the outer world again, sinking into a state of unconsciousness.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If the primordial true bone inside Stone Emperor’s body wasn’t damaged, then he might heal on his own. Unfortunately, it has been greatly damaged.” Zhang Zhong said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The greatest problem with Shi Hao’s body was that there was an extra type of symbols in his body that was terrifyingly powerful. It had already combined with his flesh and bones. There was simply no way to get rid of it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Zhang and the other doctors weren’t the only ones that knew this. Shi Ziling and his wife understood this as well. No one in the lower realm could get rid of those natural law symbols. This curse came from a type of taboo bone text.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That bone in Stone Emperor’s body is broken up in hundreds to thousands of pieces. Even if it was pieced together, it is still broken. There is less than two-thirds of the original bone left over. It’s power is steeply declining and already not enough.” Zhang Zhong shook his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was reality. That bone in Shi Hao’s body had shattered. The symbols it released could not get rid of that curse.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In this lower realm, there weren’t even deities, so what kind of power could defy the curse of one of Immortal Palace’s ‘great figures’?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, those symbols densely covered every inch of Shi Hao’s flesh and bones. Who dared to try and fix it? Once it exploded, Shi Hao’s body might be destroyed along with it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Perhaps that immortal bone was the only way. If it was implanted into Shi Hao’s body, allowing it to merge with him, even if it displayed its power, it wouldn’t harm his body. It could destroy the curse imprints.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Too cruel…” Qin Yining’s mind was trembling. To gouge out the bone of her second son to save Shi Hao, this was a great risk for both her children.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that instant, she felt incomparable suffering. Why did disaster have to befall them like this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Ziling took a deep breath, trying to calm himself down as much as possible. “Great doctor, please tell me how high the chances of success are. Exactly how much of a risk would it be?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If the immortal bone is implanted into Stone Emperor’s body, there is a sixty to seventy chance of success. It could allow him to revive, and in the future, his aptitude will be matchless, his achievements extraordinary.” Zhang Zhong gave a serious reply.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Only sixty to seventy percent chance of success?” Shi Ziling frowned. His heart rose and fell, finding it difficult to calm down.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sixty to seventy percent chance is already quite high,” Zhang Zhong said. It wouldn’t be good for him to influence their decision too much, so he could only say this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Yining closed her eyes, calming herself down. Then, she carefully thought to herself before saying, “Great doctor, I want to know how great the danger would be towards the second child.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he heard this question, Zhang Zhong could only sigh. “If this bone was your second son’s to begin with, then I would have certainty in removing it without harming him, and then borrowing it for its power.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His senior apprentice had some relationship with Immortal Mountain. When Qin Hao had the bone implanted, that senior apprentice had been invited to carry out protection. He already learned from his senior apprentice that this bone came from the higher realms and that it hadn’t been implanted into Qin Hao’s body for a long time. Carrying out an operation again like this was a bit dangerous.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhang Zhong thought carefully. Finally, he raised his head, explaining that if they tried to save Shi Hao under this type of situation, there might really be danger to Qin Hao’s life.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thirty percent death, seventy percent healthy.” This was the conclusion he came to after carefully thinking things over.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The success rate was already considered quite high. The main thing was that Qin Hao had already grown up. His vital energy was sufficient, and together with his astonishing natural aptitude, that was why there was a certain amount of certainty.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, it was still dangerous. This made Shi Ziling and his wife frown. They couldn’t calm down!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Father, mother, I don’t need this type of rescue!” Shi Hao became clear-headed again. When he heard their discussion, he was greatly shaken. With his nature, how could he make others go so far to save him?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This wasn’t fair for Qin Hao. He did not want this. Even if they tried to persuade him otherwise, he still wouldn’t agree. He would rather die!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Yining cried. She hugged his arm while soundlessly shedding tears. The older son with which she had been separated for so many years, returned. They hadn’t even reunited for that long, yet this type of terrible thing happened.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What exactly should they do? How were they supposed to save their eldest son? She was momentarily stumped for what to do, because both her sons were equally important.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soon after, Shi Hao fainted again. His body was just too weak. He had eaten all types of precious medicines and soaked in all types of spiritual liquids, but all of it could only temporarily stop him from dying.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Ziling and Qin Yining looked at each other, at a loss for what to do. They then invited other doctors over to discuss with them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two individuals were both feeling incredibly worried. They wanted to ascertain what the chances of success really were and whether they could increase it any higher. In the end, the conclusions the doctors came to were practically the same.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What were they supposed to do? They didn’t want to see Shi Hao die. They had already lost him once before! They grabbed him tightly, not wishing to let his life end.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this was the same as gambling with their second son’s life, which wasn’t fair to Qin Hao at all. Not only did he have to lose the power of the immortal bone, he had to risk the chance of dying himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The group of doctors withdrew. They couldn’t provide any biased opinions on this matter, because they couldn’t shoulder that type of responsibility. As for what the final decision would be, it was up to Shi Hao’s family to decide amongst themselves.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Hao silently appeared. He pushed open the door to the room and said, “Father, mother, I understand. If you all feel that I can save my older brother, then I have already made my preparations.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Qin Yining heard this, she immediately pulled him over. With tears flowing from her eyes, she said, “Mother won’t let anything dangerous happen to you! I won’t let you become a sacrifice!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Ziling also sighed. During these years, their second son always felt conflicted inwardly, feeling that his sole purpose of being born was to save his older brother who he had never met before. Now, this type of thing happened, so those weren’t just empty words anymore.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was why he also became silent, unable to make a decision. They were both equally important to him. How could he sacrifice his second son? They were both his children.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, Shi Ziling was only a normal father. He didn’t want anything anything unexpected to happen to his children or put them in danger.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Father, mother, I will listen to everything you guys decide on. I won’t resist anything that needs to be done. We can save older brother at any time.” After speaking, Qin Hao turned around and left.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They looked at their unconscious oldest son, and then they looked at the second son that was walking out. The husband and wife felt extremely conflicted. What exactly were they supposed to do? This was a type of torment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If we use that immortal bone, there is a sixty to seventy percent chance of being able to save Hao’er. In addition, out younger son will also have a seventy percent chance of being unaffected, able to live on without any harm.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After remaining silent for a long time, Shi Ziling spoke like this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But there is a thirty percent chance of danger! We might lose our second son…” Qin Yining said quietly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Why did they have to make such a difficult decision? Their thoughts were all over the place. They didn’t want to lose either one of them. Their older son was going to die. If they didn’t make a decision soon, he would only become weaker and weaker.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, using their second son’s immortal bone in exchange for their oldest son’s life was too dangerous. Moreover, how would Qin Hao himself feel?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Heaven, why are you so cruel?!” Shi Ziling roared.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qin Yining silently shed tears, gently caressing the unconscious Shi Hao’s cheeks while muttering, “Mother wants to save you, but she doesn’t want to harm your younger brother either…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sun began to set. They didn’t end up making a decision this entire day. This was definitely unfavorable for Shi Hao. he was becoming weaker and weaker.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That night, Shi Hao’s heart began to beat quickly. He suddenly opened his eyes. There was a female who was pointing at the area between his brows. She was trying to kill him!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How could it have become like this? His mind shook.&nbsp;</span></p>

He released a light shout. Blood flew out from his mouth, striking towards this individual.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In addition, while enduring the great pain, his chest shone.

Another small piece of the supreme being bone chipped off as divine might erupted.&nbsp;</span></p>

This woman cried out in alarm, immediately becoming much older after being swept through by the supreme being symbols. She turned into an old woman and could not budge an inch.&nbsp;</span></p>

His entire body was covered in blood as he picked her up and shouted, “Why are you doing this?”</span></p>

Someone headed over with extreme speed. In addition, Shi Ziling and his wife were startled as well. They hadn’t left for that long, yet such shocking changes took place.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pu!</span></p>

Blood erupted. It was unknown what type of method she used, but she ended her life just like that.&nbsp;</span></p>

Truly worthy of this little Stone title of mine.”</span></p>
