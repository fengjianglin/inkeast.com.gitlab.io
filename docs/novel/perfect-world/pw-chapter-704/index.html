While pulling Yun Xi with him, he displayed the Earth shrinking into inches great divine ability. After rushing out a short distance, he entered the great earth, disappearing beneath the ground and disappearing without a trace.&nbsp;</span></p>

They all opened their beaks to shoot out symbols, and some of them even brandished their divine wings to tear apart the great earth.</span></p>

When one grasped it, one could move through the skies above or the earth below. When refined to its limit, one could even travel to the sun or moon, roaming through the universe.&nbsp;</span></p>

Shi Hao and the Celestial Race’s young lady entered the ground, thus disappearing without a trace. They were birds, and as such were unsuitable to moving through the earth.&nbsp;</span></p>

The losses this time were too severe. It was too difficult to explain things to the delegation head.&nbsp;</span></p>

Even the underground terrain was affected.” Yun Xi frowned. They only traveled eight hundred li, but they were already feeling great strain.&nbsp;</span></p>

Once Celestial Race’s ancient ancestor who personally created their ancient glory revived, the situation would completely change.&nbsp;</span></p>

It was extremely dangerous. Shi Hao’s group had avoided several dangerous areas and passed by several True deities. They were careful and prudent.</span></p>

Right now, his mood was even more excellent as he dealt with that Golden Crow, plucking its feathers, butchering, and cleaning it. His movements were smooth and practiced.&nbsp;</span></p>

This fella’s mind really was a bit too unusual, right? After being chased to this point where a True deity might show up at any moment, he even had the nerve to cook a meal.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then, his fine hairs all stood on end. This fella was just too savage! Killing the enemy was one thing, but he was even going to eat it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You should start speaking. How many experts did you invite out this time, how many Heavenly deities and True deities? What other mercenary groups are going to appear?” Shi Hao roasted the Golden Crow while casually interrogating him. He wanted to obtain some valuable information.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I… don’t know.” The War Race youngster’s voice trembled.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your mouth is so tight. Could it be that you want me to roast you too?” Shi Hao smiled. His eyes swept over, and a formless pressure immediately crushed down onto this place. However, his hands never stopped, continuing to ‘work’ at the food.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He brought out some seasoning and scattered it down on the Golden Crow, and then he even more so brought out a jar of honey, smearing it over the Golden Crow’s wings that had already been roasted golden. His movements were fast and even somewhat graceful.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The War Race youngster trembled in fear and went stupid. This fella really brought these types of things with him? He had never heard of a cultivator that did something like this. It was just too weird!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, he felt even more fear. What if this person really did decide to roast him too? When this possibility emerged in his mind, he went cold from head to toe, shivering greatly inside.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I really don’t know! After the great figures of the our race discussed this matter among themselves, they made their decision. Meanwhile, I am just a younger generation youth with above average aptitude, so how could I learn about this? I just came out with a martial uncle to gain experience!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was extremely nervous, and his face was pale white. He responded carefully and cautiously out of fear of angering the devil king in front of him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was completely different from his high-spirited and incomparably judgmental attitude. Right now, his heart was full of fear. Even his martial uncle was easily trampled to death, so how could he be this youth’s opponent?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is the point of keeping you around then? You don’t even know anything. Better off just killing you…” Shi Hao said to himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Please, no!” The War Race youngster was so scared he began to tremble. He struggled with everything he had, but he couldn’t break through the seal. There was simply no way for him to escape.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What formidable individuals are there among the War Race’s younger generation?” Shi Hao asked. He didn’t believe that the so-called genius in front of him represented the most powerful youngsters of this race.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“My race’s younger generation has three great war kings. If any of them leave the clan, they would become great and influential individuals. They are powerful to the point of being immeasurable.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao nodded. This was what made sense. The glorious War Race was one of the Emperor Clans of the old world, so how could they not have any truly outstanding youth? This person in front of him was just too inferior.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your War Race has three war kings that are comparatively outstanding. Why don’t they dare call themselves War Emperors?” Shi Hao mocked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This… there is a legend that they might exist.” The face of the youth in front of him turned white. After some hesitation, he replied like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What?” Shi Hao was shocked. He was just randomly asking, but there was actually this piece of news.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t know whether it really exists, but there has always been a legend that in this world, my War Race might have someone who can obtain the title of young ‘War Emperor’.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao asked him for the details.&nbsp;</span></p>

It was just too small of a number.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In addition, the past individuals were pretty much all concentrated in the archaic era, and it was precisely them that established the unmatched glory of granting their clan the name of War Emperor Race.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another War Emperor appeared in this world?!</span></p>

She didn’t pay attention to his question and had been watching him roast the Golden Crow the entire time distractedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He immediately laughed and said, “Because I like good food, I am often being made fun of by others. It seems like I finally met an intimate friend to share my love with,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">haha!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">”&nbsp;</span></p>

His smile was bright and radiant. He personally tore off a Golden Crow wing that had honey smeared on it before handing it to Yun Xi, inviting her to have a taste.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Xi’s head of purple hair was shiny and soft. Her large eyes were like gemstones, containing a spirituality and radiance. Her fine nose was tall and straight, her red lips small and bright. There was a suffocating type of beauty to her appearance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When she heard Shi Hao’s words, she felt a wave of speechlessness. She wasn’t someone who would become an intimate friend like this, she never even had this type of interest. What kind of cultivators acted like this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason she was absent-minded just now was because she thought a few past events. There had been a youth who, in the Hundred Shattering Mountains, had an enormous bag, and inside were pots, ladles, plates, and all types of seasonings. He had been a huge laughingstock at the entrance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Later on, as expected, that fella was a foodie, eating anything from things that flew in the sky to what ran on the earth, even including the true supreme water. He even bit a person’s ear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Xi immediately felt a wave of suspicions. Back then, that youth wrestled with her, biting her snow white and sparkling earlobe. Was it for the sake of having a taste, to eat her?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When her thoughts returned to reality, she accepted the golden roasted wing, watching as it gushed with multicolored brilliance. Spiritual essence poured everywhere. She felt as if this scene was more and more familiar, as if it had all happened before.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Xi gathered her beautiful hair. Her eyes were flowing with radiance as she looked at the youth in front of her. Why did he also have this type of character, this love for food. As well as carrying all types of seasoning with him? It was just too similar to that person!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, both individuals were extremely self-confident, radiant and dazzling. When fighting a great battle against enemies, they were without any fear. There was a type of ‘unrivaled’ style to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was too similar!</span></p>

Her expression was a bit distracted as she stared at the youth in front of her. Could it be… the same person? She didn’t dare believe this. That person should have been buried in the great wasteland of the lower realm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, there was &nbsp;doubt in her heart. She was extremely unwilling to accept this and wanted to test him out. She raised her slim lily-white hands towards SHi Hao’s head of pitch-black hair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that moment, Yun Xi made an extremely brazen move. That pure white jade hand unexpectedly… grabbed Shi Hao’s ear, and then she tugged on it with a bit of force!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who are you?” She asked softly with a somewhat alluring voice. She stared into Shi Hao’s eyes to peer into his soul.&nbsp;</span></p>
