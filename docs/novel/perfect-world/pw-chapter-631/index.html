After travelling several thousand zhang inwards, a scarlet radiance streaked across, bringing with it the sound of thunder.&nbsp;</span></p>

The scarlet electrical arc hacked down, making contact with his extended palm. A brilliant rain of light that was wicked looking and beautiful was produced.</span></p>

This electrical arc’s power was great, making even his fingers feel a bit numb. His flesh was far more powerful than that of a normal supreme expert and exceeded that of most precious artifacts.&nbsp;</span></p>

These had been accumulated over endless years. The bones that were left behind were all scorched black; one could see how miserable they were before their death.</span></p>

He immediately turned his head, and what he saw was a pair of scarlet eyes that opened. Then, lightning erupted, hacking towards him.&nbsp;</span></p>

They were accompanied with crazy winds, making the enormous rocks on the ground fly everywhere. This was a creature that wasn’t weak.&nbsp;</span></p>

His eyes flickered with radiance. He cried out with shock, this was… a fish!</span></p>

It was over ten meters in length. It opened its bloody mouth and released electricity. The fish itself swam over through the void.&nbsp;</span></p>

Field Island’s terrain was extremely dry with enormous rocks everywhere, so how could a big fish appear? Shi Hao was extremely shocked.</span></p>

It rushed over with great power. There were lightning symbols all around its body that erupted here.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It really is strange. How did it grow up? There’s no water here at all!” Shi Hao took action. His palms shone. A Suan Ni imprint appeared, absorbing all of the lightning. Then, it attacked towards the fish.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, all of the fine hairs on his body shone. He looked into the distance and saw that multiple pairs of scarlet eyes were opening one after another. They were quickly rushing over.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“School of fish?” Shi Hao’s eyes widened. Then, he felt as if things weren’t going well. The distance looked like a sky full of stars. Countless eyes appeared, converging on this direction.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, he couldn’t help but retreat. There were just too many of these fish to the point where it was a bit terrifying. They hid the sky and covered the earth, bringing with them tremendous amounts of lightning. Thunderous sounds rang incessantly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Through the light produced by the electricity, he could see thousands and tens of thousands of silver vicious fish. They ranged from several meters to several tens of meters. Together, the amount of divine force they exerted was astonishing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before leaving, Shi Hao also issued an attack, sweeping out the stalk of grass’ sword intent to kill several enormous fish as a warning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hou...</span></p>

Heaven overflowing lightning radiance flickered about, illuminating these mountains. A great white expanse was formed. The great mists were even scattered.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao turned around, his body feeling a bit chilly. He saw that the few large fish at the very back were the size of mountains, sinister and terrifying as they moved their tails in the void.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The enormous beasts in the ocean were just too large. The most terrifying thing was that one or two of them ignited their divine flames. The lightning they released was extremely astonishing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the next moment, Shi Hao increased his speed. As soon as he left, the sea of lightning blasted the spot he was originally standing in, making that area as bright as day.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao fled into the distance. There was no need to fight, because there were too many fishes, so there was no way he could kill all of them. In addition, there were even divine grade experts in the rear, making it quite dangerous.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dense school of fish pursued him, not willing to give up. Only after travelling more than a hundred li did they give up, because they couldn’t see traces of Shi Hao anymore.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It really is a strange place…” Shi Hao headed deeper and deeper, feeling like Fiend Island was scary. From time to time, blinding light would streak across the air, as if there were cracks in the void. It was enough to threaten supreme experts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The further in he moved, the thicker the electromagnetic mists became. It was extremely difficult for normal people to endure. Along the way, he saw many corpses, some that hadn’t died too long ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;It was clear that quite a few people had fallen among the ones that came earlier.&nbsp;</span></p>

It was especially bright in the dusky mist, like a divine flame that was jumping. It made him a bit hesitant.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He carefully approached it. He saw a bone pagoda that radiated gentle light. This was a formation set up by someone. A few cultivators were seated here, taking in and sending out foundational energy to recover from their injuries.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao made sure that this wasn’t some type of trap, and then he got closer. There were several dozen people recovering here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Some people opened their eyes, but after seeing him, they closed their eyes again. There were a few others that were chatting in a soft voice, discussing their benefits in the dangerous area.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao open-mindedly asked for guidance, asking what was going on with this bone pagoda. There were many things he didn’t understand.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The dangerous region is extremely dangerous. This is a bone pagoda left behind by a few expert in the past when they isolated themselves here. It became a place of shelter for those that came after.” Someone explained.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were quite a few places like this. They were similar to lighthouses, acting as guides for those to come.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During the endless years, quite a few cultivators came here to sharpen themselves and look for natural opportunities. Once they gained some type of insight, they would open up a cave or arrange some formations.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Later on, those caves and formations were used by later generations and continuously modified. They were then turned into shining lighthouses.&nbsp;</span></p>

Places like these with these types of traces were relatively safer. Once one entered the depths of the restricted area, there definitely wouldn’t be this type of protection.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yi</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">, this is a painting?” He saw a painting that was stuck on a bone pagoda. It was actually his grandfather, on it written clearly that if anyone could find traces of this person, the Qin Clan would present a true deity magical artifact.&nbsp;</span></p>

In the past, they even caught this person before, but later on, he was successfully rescued.” Someone said.&nbsp;</span></p>
