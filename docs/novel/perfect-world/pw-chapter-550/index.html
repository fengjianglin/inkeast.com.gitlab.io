It was just a single undying existence that swept through this world to capture cultivators that ignited their divine flames, remaining unstoppable to the end.&nbsp;</span></p>

For the rest of this world, the disturbance this time was too great. Someone actually captured all of the deities! His methods were heaven defying. This was truly an inconceivable thing!</span></p>

It was bit too ordinary.” Shi Hao stood in the imperial palace while gazing into the moon up in the sky and muttering to himself. He seemed extremely lonesome.&nbsp;</span></p>

When he saw this scene from the distance and heard him talking to himself, he felt a bit speechless. The outside was in an uproar, and the word was not peaceful at all, yet his majesty was feeling lonesome.&nbsp;</span></p>

He stood on the altar while gazing into the sky. He felt quite frustrated. He said his farewells to the Willow Deity, and he sent off the little pagoda. Would they be able to return alive to meet him again?</span></p>

Since the ancient times, every single supreme being that entered those gates never reappeared. When he recalled this, he couldn’t help but sigh.</span></p>

How could he not be worried? He felt a wave of disappointment and frustration. Was there ever going to be a reunion again? When he thought of everything that had happened in the past, he felt extremely gloomy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dark clouds floated past, covering the bright and cold moon.

Heavenly talents rose in large numbers, and every single race had peerless geniuses. There were even exceptional talents and otherworldly fairies. It was unknown just how many supreme youths and divine individuals there were in the great earth.&nbsp;</span></p>

That was his real stage, one that was filled with hot-blooded battles between exceptional geniuses of his generation. It was a place where supreme beings competed and immortals stood against each other!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao gradually calmed down, no longer appearing bewildered. His eyes became resolute. When he finished his stay in the lower realm, he was definitely ascend into the heavens and proceed into the greater world of the higher realms. He was going to jump out from this hole.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little big bro, is something the matter?” Qingfeng walked over. He had already familiarized himself with many things under Peng Nine’s instruction and had gotten used to life in the outside world.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Apart from him, Dazhuang who followed the War King and Pihou who was enjoying the mortal world were quite satisfied as well. They adapted to everything quite quickly.&nbsp;</span></p>

Could it be that his little big brother was going to go far away and leave the wasteland region?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao didn’t hide anything and said, “In the eyes of those of the higher realms, the eight regions are just a cage. I want to break free and search for a path of the great dao.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In reality, there were many others that thought of the lower realm as a cage as well. It was just too small and couldn’t sharpen ‘true dragons’. Exceptional talents and immortals could only emerge and compete in the higher realms.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little big bro, are you really going to leave? If you do, won’t we never be able to see you again?” Qingfeng’s eyes that were full of shock widened.&nbsp;</span></p>

He patted his shoulder and said, “Don’t worry, how could that be? Of course we will see each other again.”</span></p>

He didn’t want to disrupt Qingfeng’s way of life. After all, he was still too young. Placing Stone Country on his shoulders would be too great of a burden. He still need to think more about this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao couldn’t just walk away from all of his problems. There were still other things that had to be arranged. Stone Country, his parents, Stone Village, and even future aspirations could be dealt with now.&nbsp;</span></p>

This storm was much greater than what they had anticipated. Even though Shi Hao felt rather calm, the outside world was discussing this fervently.&nbsp;</span></p>

They had lost their advantage, and their losses this time were severe. Their gates had been trampled on by the undying existence, and all of their experts that lit their divine flames were captured. A wave of great darkness filled their sects.&nbsp;</span></p>

However, after the great disaster ended, everyone felt great fear inside.&nbsp;</span></p>

These events inspired great awe throughout the empire!</span></p>

Now that the undying inheritances had all shrunk back and were going to seal up their mountains, it naturally left them feeling great fear.&nbsp;</span></p>

They entered the imperial capital one after another to ask for forgiveness.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao sat inside the main hall while overlooking everyone. He didn’t show any mercy, and towards those that caused serious problems, he directly executed them without holding back. Those that were still reasonable could be forgiven.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Iron-bloodedness and appeasement coexisted.

Some quickly went to beg for forgiveness, while some directly fled, not daring to accept punishment.&nbsp;</span></p>

The War King and the others were sent out immediately to pursue them, and he himself also took action to slaughter the traitors. With his current power, how could king level figures even resist?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of Stone Country was stirred up. All those that tried to stir up trouble kept quiet out of fear, deciding to behave themselves.&nbsp;</span></p>

Shi Hao’s forceful methods left all sides shaken. Stone Country was finally without cracks and unified. It became a great country not only in name, but in reality as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Great changes happened to the other countries as well. With the retreat of the Heaven Mending Sect, Immortal Mountain, Western Sect, several countries revived and began to stand upright again.&nbsp;</span></p>

He immediately became lost in his thoughts. This place had once left him with deep impressions. He felt a sense of belonging here.&nbsp;</span></p>

The first time he entered this school, there were cheerful chatter and cries of joy, but there was also sorrow and tragedy.&nbsp;</span></p>

As a youth that had walked out from the great wastelands, he was immersed in new and exciting experiences.&nbsp;</span></p>

There were also the elders, who, for the sake of holding the enemy off, stayed behind and self-destructed to help everyone leave. It was an extremely sad and tragic event.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Unforgivable. How can I forget such a thing?!” Shi Hao said softly. This was something that he had never taken care of.&nbsp;</span></p>

Today, he finally had the power to do so.&nbsp;</span></p>

It erupted with dark light and emitted a fluctuation that was several times more terrifying than anything it had released in the past.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It seemed to possess its own spirit, breaking free from Shi Hao’s control and moving about in the void. It was as if a true dragon was rising into the heavens. Only after a long time had passed did it return to his hands.&nbsp;</span></p>

He appeared near a large pond. There was an enormous tribe there.&nbsp;</span></p>

Back then, this youth used a hammer to beat him until the bump on his head became ‘outstanding’, leaving him confused and disoriented.
