Truly disappointing!” When War King and the others received news about what happened in the Western Border, they were all shocked and helpless. They didn’t say anything for a long period of time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao placed the emperor seal on the dragon writing desk. Auspicious energy surged, and hundreds of strands of heavenly dragons curled up around this. The precious imprint was unordinary, enough to contain the fate energy of a country within it. Its might was boundless.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your Majesty, are you truly going to leave?” Peng Nine asked. The others opened their mouths as well. They knew that there was no way to convince him to stay. He had already set his mind on leaving.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I want to enter the higher realms.” Shi Hao spoke. Then, he bestowed great gifts onto several individuals, asking these supreme experts to supervise the country and assist Qingfeng.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And if Qingfeng wasn’t suitable, then there wasn’t much else to be said. He asked the War King to then replace him and have Qingfeng abdicate, thus restoring his freedom.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He believed that with several supreme experts supporting this country, these eight regions shouldn’t have any other powers that could move Stone Country, because most of the experts from each side had been wiped out during the great calamity.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your Majesty, must you really go to the higher realms?” The War King asked. If he left, then it was unknown how many years would pass before they would meet again. It wasn’t odd to say that they might never meet again in this lifetime.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No, I will go to Three Life Mountain to cultivate,” said Shi Hao.&nbsp;</span></p>

The deity and Flying Python that descended from Heavenly Country had died, so did this mean the end? Normally speaking, with heaven and earth separated, there was no way there would be other creatures that descended, but who could guarantee something like that?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, both that will and python deity descended. After the three sects’ giants paid unimaginably great prices, a crack was opened in the void.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What if there were still others that were determined to send creatures with their divine flames lit into the lower realm?</span></p>

If he sneakily entered the higher realms and hid there while keeping a low profile, he might be able to stay safe. Even if he abdicated now and hid in the lower realms’ great wastelands without emerging, there wouldn’t be any dangers either.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he didn’t want to do things like this. What if an existence that lit its divine flame descended into the lower realm to vent out their anger towards Stone Country on the people he knew?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A such, he had to let the entire world know that he abdicated on his own accord and would go to Three Life Mountain to live in seclusion and comprehend the great dao. He would cultivate in isolation there.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If he did this, then if they were truly aiming for him, then they would naturally head straight for Three Life Mountain and settle things there. They wouldn’t involve the people at his side.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your Majesty, if you do this, you’ll be placing yourself in great danger!” When the War King heard this, he showed great worry and advised against it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ones that advised him in staying behind also immediately said that he should either ascend into the heavens or hide in the great wastelands and cultivate in secret. He couldn’t do things like this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How can I just run from the problem?” Shi Hao shook his head. Since he accepted the inheritance, should there be any after effects, he cannot leave behind any danger. If there wasn’t any dangers, then he could enter the heavens.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao left almost everything he had on him behind, only bringing a few things with him. He then walked alone to Three Life Mountain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That day, the world was greatly shaken. Stone Emperor abdicated his throne and secluded himself in a daoist mountain to comprehend the great dao and carry out a transcendence of his self, leaving everyone astonished.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">You have to understand that he had only succeeded the throne for a short period of time and only just calmed down various chaos to put Stone Country on the right track, yet he immediately abdicated. This completely exceeded everyone’s expectations.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone was paying close attention to this matter. Even Heaven Mending Sect, Western Sect, and the others sent people to confirm whether or not this was true.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The little Stone is so stunning. This is a bold and courageous move! He is aiming straight for divinity and is not held back by the desires of the mortal world. His dao heart is firm and steady!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Quite a few people sighed. They were all in admiration.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If they were in his place, as the emperor of a country, would they be able to abandon everything? That represented honor and glory, the highest status among humans. How could they give something like that up?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He killed the undefeated legendary dual-pupils and cut down supreme experts from all sides. Now, the little Stone treads on his own path. He will definitely be even more outstanding and glorious!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All sides were shaken. The eight regions all began to discuss excitedly, everyone sighing in admiration.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Three Life Mountain was twenty thousand li or so from Stone Country Imperial Capital and known to be an extremely spiritual area. Beautiful mountain peaks towered towered next to each other, and spiritual essence flowed in abundance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao chose a small mountain that was relatively isolated and built a grass hut. He then moved over a large bluestone and used it to sit on. Everything was extremely simple.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He cultivated and comprehended the dao here. He wasn’t purposely waiting for them to come. Unless a great enemy showed up, he wouldn’t pay the outside world much attention. He brought out the Ten Thousand Spirit Diagram and carefully studied and reviewed it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was his path, as well as his dao. Every time he observed it, he would obtain a different type of comprehension. There were all types of creatures on its surface, including those as powerful as the Kun Peng and as weak as the ants. However, they were all extremely great.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why don’t I see any creatures like those exceptional talents that have innate unique divine abilities?” Shi Hao said to himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He held a sparkling bone piece in his hand, looking over it many times. He gained some insights, but he was also somewhat confused. He began to think and deduce various things.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Based on what the Willow Deity said, the supreme being bone was extremely powerful, but in the end, it might also be shackles from one’s ultimate transcendence.&nbsp;</span></p>

He began to contemplate his path from today onward.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During the following days, he temporarily put down the Ten Thousand Spirit Diagram and continuously studied his own bone’s profound mysteries. He then began to experiment with them, seeing what would happen if he engraved all of the symbols in his flesh.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Formation Arrangement Realm was the engraving of all types of formations in one’s flesh. One could continue this process through this realm into the supreme expert realm, and even after one ignited their divine flame.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao made his decision. He was going to engrave all of the symbols in his body, making sure that it was in every inch of his blood and flesh instead of only having it on this piece of bone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The following half a month was filled a period of great hardships and challenges for Shi Hao.&nbsp;</span></p>

He was now doing everything he could to carve them all into his body’s bones and flesh.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He placed quite a bit of importance on this. After experiencing several life and death great battles, he deeply felt that the precious technique in his body was the most powerful one.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This wasn’t saying that his precious technique was number one under heaven. The Kun Peng technique was extremely powerful and known as one of the archaic vicious ten. Its might shocked the ancients and present, but the Kun Peng Race’s technique, when used by a human, couldn’t necessarily become the most powerful.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, he recently cultivated the Zhuyan race’s seventy-two transformations and turned himself into a Kun Peng before using this ability. This improved it greatly, making it much more powerful.&nbsp;</span></p>

As such, he attached great importance to it, casting away all other distracting thoughts and wholeheartedly devoted his attention into this.&nbsp;</span></p>
