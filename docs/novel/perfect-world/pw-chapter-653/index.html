They were all of different races, and all of them had kings. Someone found it inside of an ancient cave. This was the bug domain left behind by Origin Sky Supreme Being to raise the king of ten thousand bugs.&nbsp;</span></p>

They wanted to find the bug nest and obtain the king of ten thousand bugs’ pupa to raise it themselves.&nbsp;</span></p>

Someone indeed found it, and that was why all of these young supreme beings are fighting over it,” said a cultivator. He pointed towards the distance. There were five divine mountains at the center of that region, and it was suffused with five colored immortal light.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that region, there were traces of the king of ten thousand bugs.

Was it worth fighting over?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"There are too many uses. Once it is confirmed to be a king of ten thousand bugs, that means that it possesses an tremendous amount of spirituality. It is worth being called a priceless treasure!” Someone sighed and said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Based on what they said, the king of ten thousand bugs not only possessed shocking fighting ability, making it able to fight exceptional talents, it could grow up together with the young supreme being and become their most powerful aide.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In addition, the king of ten thousand bugs possessed astonishing spirituality. It was sensitive to metals and can discover underground divine ore and extract void gold or other immortal materials. It could also aid in the refinement of weapons.&nbsp;</span></p>

The king of ten thousand bugs was sensitive towards the worlds’ dao and natural laws, able to capture all types of symbol traces and search for caves of predecessors in this word. Discovering supreme being traces like Origin Sky Secret Realm was not impossible either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">---</span></p>

The king of ten thousand bugs’ value was too great, worth making even exceptional talents fight to the death over it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it was the outside world, those giants would definitely take action.</span></p>

He immediately thought of the Emperor Butterfly. It only appeared once in the archaic era and usually never appeared in the world. Could it be… the king of ten thousand bugs?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao was sure that the Emperor Butterfly, for most bug races, was an indescribable type of power. It could order and rule the races like an emperor!</span></p>

He had the Emperor Butterfly already, and he didn’t think it was inferior to the king of ten thousand bugs.</span></p>

Right now, there were exceptional talents competing with each other and creatures with their divine flames lit. It was extremely dangerous and not suitable for going into isolation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Along the way, he noticed many bug hordes and continuously took action, catching a few exceptionally rare species.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Scarlet Sky Centipede, Eight Footed Blue Toad, Golden Scorpion…” Shi Hao’s eyes shone. These were all wondrous bugs that could be stumbled upon but not begged for. Many of them were almost extinct in the outside world, but he found hordes of them in here. It was really precious medicine bestowed onto him by the heavens.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, he was pleasantly surprised that these creatures’ places of residence had precious materials as well. The ancient caves had rare ores that were needed for medicine refinement, for example, winged dragon earth and golden scorpion rock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is too great!” Shi Hao was overjoyed. With this, he didn’t have to use substitutes. He already obtained all the rare things he needed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He activated lightning, turning into a human streak of lightning and disappeared into the distance. Soon after, there was no trace of him left.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Shi Hao left, Fire Devil Palace’s Chi Lingkong and another expert that ignited his divine flame from the same clan rushed here. They released a breath of relief. That Demonic Blood Ghost Tree chased after them the entire time. They were the only two left now. The other two had lost their lives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little monster, I will never let you go. I will definitely find you and kill you!” These two people hated Shi Hao to the extreme. When they heard that a bug emperor appeared, they couldn’t help but be moved and stay behind here.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In Vermilion Village, apart from replenishing his natural laws, he also completed the reconstruction of the Blood Transformation Realm. This time, he was going to reconstruct his Heavenly Passages. This was actually the cultivation realm he attached the most importance to.&nbsp;</span></p>

This was the only cultivation realm he had to treat carefully, because he could feel that this secret realm was too different.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the past, he opened ten heavenly passages, shaking the entire wasteland region. This was what allowed his fighting strength to dominate his peers. It displayed amazing power.</span></p>
