This was an extremely terrifying scene. Phantom Drake Dao Gate’s people were completely wiped out, with Shi Hao being the only one left.

It was a precious place within this small world. It was precisely this place Yao Yi used to become a deity, obtaining great natural luck.</span></p>

He could now be considered to be a deity as well, his combat strength now advancing by leaps and bounds.&nbsp;</span></p>

He still needed to continue. This was just a temporary period of rest, allowing his body to recover. Otherwise, if he continued like this, his foundational energy would be completely exhausted.&nbsp;</span></p>

There was no longer any black scorchedness, his skin white and translucent like fine jade.&nbsp;</span></p>

After all, they were all burned by a hundred and eight different types of flames, so now, there was still some remaining power that was surging.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This spring was the accumulation of endless years. It had just accumulated this pool of precious liquid, but Phantom Drake Dao Gate’s people used up a lot, and the remaining amount was completely refined by Shi Hao.&nbsp;</span></p>

He began to skin it, his movements skilled and practiced. What left him regretful was that the dragon tendon had long broken, its symbols wiped out.&nbsp;</span></p>

It was destroyed along with the destruction of the Flood Dragon tendon. He couldn’t obtain it.&nbsp;</span></p>

Even though that was the precious technique of an exceptional talent, it couldn’t compare to his. He would only be biting off more than he could chew, so that was why he decided not to think about it any longer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ve been too tired recently. I should take some time to recover my body.” Shi Hao smiled extremely happily.&nbsp;</span></p>

They truly wanted to fly into Immortal Ancient and turn Shi Hao into a bloody paste with a single slap. None of them were able to restrain their anger.&nbsp;</span></p>

Normally speaking, they wouldn’t die in battle and would be protected by the entire clan, let alone be eaten by another.</span></p>

This was too difficult to imagine. How could it be endured?!</span></p>

It’s piping hot, how fragrant!” Within the thousand world, a youth was watching a bone cauldron while gulping down his saliva.&nbsp;</span></p>

Spiritual spring was added, and dao flame was stirred on, continuously stewing it.&nbsp;</span></p>
