 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The damaged cocoon gradually peeled off, the scene strange and astonishing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The cocoon formed from dao laws was damaged. It looked like it was burned through, gradually breaking apart, revealing the person within. His skin was dim, within the dao laws actually carrying a type of simple and unadorned energy, not like a biological body but instead like an artifact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The scorched black cocoon suddenly became brilliant, blazing viciously. Those were regulations, order that flourished to the peak, submerging Shi Hao within.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn’t even this blinding when the cocoon was burned by that fist-sized mysterious fiery light before. Right now, it actually burned to its greatest state, brilliant to the extreme.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, this was also terrifying. It signified the collision and destruction of heavens’ laws, so how was Shi Hao within supposed to deal with this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not far out, that beautiful woman released a cry of alarm. When she thought that Shi Hao might have succeeded, there was actually this type of transformation that happened, truly unexpected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao was definitely in huge trouble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His dull-colored skin was immediately set aflame, brilliant to the peak, because he was turned into a torch, surrounded by all types of regulations, burning together with that cocoon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was dao flame, flames produced by the heavens’ ten thousand dao, the most terrifying type!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It could burn anything, able to turn anything into ashes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dao, there was only one in the great heaven and earth. However, it could be divided into over ten thousand natural laws, and right now, this was precisely a flame produced by them, a flame that could wipe out everything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao’s body was full of holes, instantly blasted beyond recognition. However, there was no blood, only wounds everywhere, his body incredibly dark.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was like a piece of damaged charcoal, a piece that was then smashed by a giant rock until it became ragged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, he was already standing at the edge of destruction, his body and soul about to be extinguished at any moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao sighed. He just knew that there was no way things could go so smoothly. If he really succeeded just that easily, there would have been someone who accomplished this way before him, why would it wait until today? Until now, no one has successfully completed this path!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, not far out, that fist-sized mysterious ball of fire continued to jump about. It was surrounded by immortal energy and chaotic light, incredibly misty and mysterious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao had previously suspected that this fire might be an immortal flame, chaotic flame, a type of flame from the Nine Heavens Ten Earths.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However now, he began to doubt himself, hard to say just what kind of thing this was exactly. It could turn into a mirror, illuminate the most profound great dao, and could even become a flame, burn all things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just now, it completely burned through the cocoon formed from natural laws!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And now, it was no longer moving, watching without lifting a finger, only observing, as if it was quietly waiting for a result.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao was in danger, his life might very well be lost at any moment. He was burned until he was like a lamp without fuel, his skin dried-up, bones about to break. Grease was released from his scorched body, releasing&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">zi zi&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">sounds, this scene truly making one’s scalp go numb.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the very least, the female creature not far out even felt a bit terrified, having the urge to stop and assist him. However, she didn’t know if there was a need or not.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was because Shi Hao was still alive, still resisting, still pursuing the dao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She now began to feel that this young man might be crazy!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao was indeed in a state of dao comprehension. It was as if he thought of many things at once, to the extent where when his divine consciousness was perplexed, he still thought of many things, the events of the past emerging in his head one after another.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This type of impasse, he had experienced this before. When he cultivated immortal energy in the past, he had been burned by great dao flames, could be considered nine deaths one life, almost completely destroyed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now, he was cooked through by ten thousand streaks of dao flames, seeing the most fundamental symbol essence, peering into the essential fundamentals of the great universe, observing its constituents.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On one hand, he was greedily studying everything, comparing it to himself, using it to activate his ‘inner dao’, compare and verify the two, but on the other hand, he also had misgivings towards his own life. If he ended up directly dying here, then everything would be lost.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao’s body was almost burned rotten, his flesh almost completely gone, only having a dried-up skeleton wrapped in a layer of skin left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only, he didn’t die. There was a type of resistance within him that stopped the corrosion of ten thousand dao’s flames. It was because back then, he had already been burned, previously experiencing something similar. There was fiery light resonating within his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Back then, I already treaded on this path, my past self surviving a miracle in itself. However, that was equivalent to already activating the ‘inner dao’. This is what is stopping, resisting the great cosmos’ dao!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao understood, immediately figuring out many things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only, at this time, the flames became even more intense, even more resplendent than the heavens’ ten thousand dao of the past, even more terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the past, he only used the ten thousand flames to forge himself, create immortal energy through the burning, only starting to ignite his true self. However now, natural laws filled the sky, pouring down like a waterfall. This was the complete dao, not holding back anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This type of power was simply impossible to contend against. He might be turned into ashes at any time!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though the stone slab was shining right now, protecting and assisting him with everything it had, the effects were no longer that prominent. There was a chance that Shi Hao might be scorched black and wiped out at any moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the end, a streak of clear light rushed out from Shi Hao’s body. It wasn’t extremely bright, but it was extremely distinct, released from a gate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He opened his flesh treasury, as if he opened up an immortal gate. The human body might have many gates, and now, he was starting to dig them up, opening this type of thing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, this was precisely the so-called inner dao, what could stand side by side with the great heaven and earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A speck of dust could fill the sea, it was precisely this type of profound meaning. Even though the human body was insignificant, unable to compare to the star system, once the ‘gates’ within one’s body were opened, then one could indeed transcend.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The heavens’ ten thousand flames turned into a strange diagram, and then it smashed downwards. It was no longer in the shape of a flame, but rather wanted to completely crush Shi Hao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, his body was also like this. Bundles of clear light appeared one after another, all of them extremely mysterious. They merged together, forming a diagram, resisting the force of the outside world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That is…” Not far away, that woman was extremely shocked. The clear light released bundle after bundle, they came from gates one after another!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In that instant, many dao gates appeared from within Shi Hao’s body, all of them opening up a crack, releasing a glimmer of radiance, resisting the pressure of the outside world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao was greatly moved. This was was the inner dao, the power of the human body. It verified the validity of this path!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As expected, the human body itself could stand side by side with the great universe, the inner dao able to contend against the external great dao, neck and neck. The crucial point was how to make it appear!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Honglong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Outside of his body, the heavens’ ten thousand flames all appeared, pressing downwards. Eventually, the diagram that was formed actually produced a yin fish, crushing Shi Hao’s muscles and bones until they were about to snap, warping into a curved figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, inside Shi Hao, clear light was released. It gathered together, forming a yang fish, rushing out, pressing forward from his body’s other direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is…” That woman’s eyes were wide open, feeling extremely shocked. She was the only one who saw this scene. Could it be that this was precisely this youth’s path?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This left her extremely shocked. That was definitely an interpretation of the dao, an embodiment of the dao!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The great universe’s dao crushed down, combining with a person and his inner dao, thus producing a yin yang symbol.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If someone made this drawing to explain the world’s profound mysteries, then that was one thing, not all that special, but right now, it formed under this type of state!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One had to understand that right now, that youth was currently suffering, about to die at anytime, so there was no way he intentionally produced this type of situation. This was formed completely naturally!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This type of pain and suffering, this type of torment, experience, right now actually formed this kind of unmatched dao diagram!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, everything stopped, all things freezing. Regardless of whether it was space or time, it all seemed to have entered an eternal silence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time stopped, completely frozen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In that instant, Shi Hao seemed to have attained the imperishable. This type of stagnation, this type of halting of time, made him feel a type of deep void, one that was incredibly distant and ancient.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In that instant of concentration, he seemed to have crossed ten thousand generations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a feeling of great changes, heaviness, as well as a type of boundless darkness. It was as if he was experiencing a reincarnation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chi!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finally, the stillness was broken, everything returning to normal. Shi Hao’s body was in tatters. All of the so-called clear light scattered, entering his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, the ten thousand flames of the heavens were also extinguished, thus disappearing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is that your path?” Not far out, that woman asked with a trembling voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It is not!” Shi Hao denied. That was just a coincidence, a moment on his journey, not the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The great universe wasn’t him, and he wasn’t willing to become one with the great cosmos either. Perhaps one day, he might leave it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What he relied on was only himself, his own flesh, as well as his own spirit. Only by making himself stronger could he face anything that came at him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within his body, it was as if heaven fell and earth split apart. Immortal gates were opened one after another, these gates like volcanos, releasing surging potential and power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was submerged within this type of light, everything incredibly brilliant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If I wanted to, I could produce that type of diagram, countless types of those diagrams.” Shi Hao said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, within his body and outside of his body, it was unknown just how many yin yang divine diagrams appeared. They flowed within his blood, imprinting themselves on his bones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were also some that enlarged, appearing outside his body, wrapping him within, distorting his body once more into that graceful and powerful yin yang curve.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, in the end, they scattered again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His dao, what he sought, was the inner dao. He didn’t have to use this type of diagram to explain it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao was truly comprehending the dao, seeking great power. Perhaps the word seeking couldn’t be used, because he wouldn’t seek it. This was something that already existed in his body, something that was his to begin with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was on the premise that he truly comprehended the true self, understood his own existence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In that instant not too long ago, the world froze, time stopped. He seemed to have crossed through endless time, millions and millions of years passing by with a single glance back. That instant had left too great of an impact on him, and from this, he gained enlightenment, opening up many ‘gates’ within himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The gates… amount of time they can be opened… is very limited, because you… have yet to reach that step.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right at this moment, a voice sounded, broken and interrupted, like a candle flame in the wind. In addition, it was just that ancient, carrying a type of weariness, tiredness, a dying aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was a flame, a fist-sized flame. It was surrounded by immortal energy, wrapped within chaotic light, its existence seeming more and more mysterious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fist-sized flame was still that big, not enlarging. However, he clearly saw countless figures fighting, roaring, howling, as well as endless bloody light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Millions and millions creatures howled, countless soul figures clashing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the end, everything before him became peaceful once more. The voice by his ears disappeared, that flame seemingly returning to normal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What exactly is this flame?” Shi Hao’s voice was bitter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, Shi Hao examined the inside of his body. Those were gates, one after the other, just that brilliant, displaying the boundless dao laws for him, currently releasing the most profound and mysterious chains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the inner dao, his dao!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, right now, he was only trying to break through a cultivation realm, to become a sect level expert, not standing at the peak of his life. The release was only momentary, he had to truly open up all of the gates in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Using the body as the seed, it is just like what I had imagined.” Shi Hao said to himself. He was walking his own path, similar to what Great Elder had passed down to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeking the inner dao, relying on himself, not seeking the great universe’s dao, this was his path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Using the body as the seed was precisely to open up the gates within his own body, release his own dao. This was the start of his path! Only now was it really like as if a seed had just been planted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within his body, the countless gates weren’t really fully opened. They were slowly closing, and then in the end, only a small crack remained, releasing a strand of clear light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, this light interweaved together, forming a seed, condensing within his body, obtaining the recognition of the great world. This was like the seed of heaven.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, this type of seed of heaven would naturally receive the blessing of the great heaven and earth’s various laws, able to display the power of the world, its divine might immeasurable!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only, this all still relied on this universe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao used the body as a seed, this was completely different.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, the seed he condensed was precisely himself. In the future, what he was going to rely on was also himself!</span></p>
