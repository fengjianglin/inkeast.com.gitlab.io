 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His stature wasn’t all that tall, but he had a heroic air around him. His expression was calm, not showing any fear. He didn’t seem to attach much importance to the opponent in front of him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“His name is Luo Dao, originating from Scarlet Province. He has a Sparrow Bone bone Sword that is rumored to be his exceptional expert bone as well. When the sword radiance is released, there is nothing it can’t stop. He has killed deities before even while in the Supreme Expert Realm.” Hong Huang secretly said to Shi Hao to remind him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An exceptional talent, moreover one with such great battle successes, one who overlooked several provinces and now already become a deity. This was definitely one of the most dangerous creatures within the current Immortal Ancient.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Exceptional talents were heaven warping and unmatched to begin with. Even if a group of people surrounded them and tried to defeat them with numbers, they would all still just be sending themselves to death, let alone an exceptional talent that had now become a deity. This individual was definitely terrifying.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao looked towards the silver robed youngster and said, “Who do you think you are? Just an exceptional talent, yet still dare to act so overbearing. Do you feel like you can overlook everyone under the heavens already?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“From a certain perspective, towards people like you, I can definitely show contempt.” The silver robed youngster Luo Dao said calmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Same rules. Kill him, and then the two of us will split everything fifty fifty.” In the rear, a blue clothed youth walked over, and even his eyes were blue. There was a hazy blue aura around his body as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His blood and energy were like a sea. Along with his steps, this entire world seemed to be moving in response, rumbling about. This heaven and earth seemed to harmonize with his existence, releasing dao sounds.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was definitely a result of his dao being profound, magical force purified, and embodiment of his aptitude strengthening. As he walked over, his footsteps merged with heaven and earth. There was a vague feeling of oneness with heaven and humanity.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This type of person was definitely an outstanding talent of a clan, one of the most powerful individuals. In the future, he would rule over a clan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“And who are you?” Shi Hao’s eyebrows furrowed slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lan Yichen.” The youth said, his eyes carrying ridicule as he looked at Shi Hao. He walked over calmly, about to obtain a stalk of divine medicine just like that, making a brilliant smile appear on his face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was because the formation here was extremely formidable, difficult to break through, yet someone helped them break it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This type of waiting in the rear, stepping out at the crucial moment, and then easily picking the peach left him with an extremely good feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He… is actually Lan Yichen.” Hong Huang was shocked. She quickly told Shi Hao about this person’s history.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This clan was extremely unordinary, originating from Blue Gold Mountain Range, a small clan that was formed after a type of essence gold developed a spirit. Even though their clan didn’t have many members, every single person that walked out was exceptionally terrifying.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, this Lan Yichen was precisely the clan’s most well-known youth who had been unstoppable in his region, defeating all experts in his path. When he was a supreme expert, he was known as the most powerful of a province.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the distance, there were a few other experts that had turned into deities, arriving after hearing the disturbance. Right now, some people recognized them, and they couldn’t help but back up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One exceptional talent was enough to overlook the crowd and rule over a region, definitely someone who was powerful and unmatched. Even if many experts at the same cultivation realm came, it still wouldn’t do anything.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yet now, two of them were joining hands like this, so how were they supposed to even fight? There wasn’t even half a percent chance of success!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">None of them expected that two great experts would come together like this. They would definitely sweep through everything around them, with no enemies who could match them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hong Huang’s expression had long changed. She tugged on a corner of Shi Hao’s clothes, telling him that if he couldn’t do it, then he should hurry and escape. Otherwise, it would be extremely dangerous.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then this means that today, I’ve encountered two experts that rank at least in the top ten thousand.” Shi Hao said. He was still extremely calm, not showing any fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Lan Yichen heard this, his smile immediately became cold. He had been the most powerful supreme expert of a province, and there were only three thousand provinces, yet he was actually being ranked as someone in the top ten thousand.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The higher realms are so large, geniuses numbering so many. Don’t act so self-confident.” Shi Hao said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Interesting. Already beyond dead, yet you still don’t realize it.” Lan Yichen revealed a faint smile, and then he looked towards the silver robed youth. “This time, you should take action first.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The silver robed youngster Luo Dao walked forward step by step. He looked at Shi Hao and said, “I’ll give you two a chance. If you bow down and serve me, I’ll spare your lives.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you going to keep them just to burden us?” Lan Yichen curled his lips.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Leave them alive to break formations. We’ll have a use for them in the future.” The silver-robed youngster Luo Dao said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Formation masters normally speaking didn’t have cultivation levels too great, but in Immortal Ancient, they might display tremendous use, because there were definitely more than just these historical remains.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Youngster, are you looking for death?” The Divine Striking Stone clamored. It had long become fed up with these two, feeling incredibly angry.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it was an ordinary person, they would definitely submit to this humiliation. Even the young outstanding talent of a clan would likely have to endure it. It was because there were two great young kings here.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, regardless of whether it was the Divine Striking Stone or Shi Hao, they were full of explosive tempers here. How could they allow the enemy to suppress them like this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Leave behind that weird stone monster, kill the male.” Lan Yichen spoke, his face becoming cold.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The silver robed youngster nodded. He was extremely indifferent. Then, he gave Hong Huang a look, saying, “I recognize you, Blood Phoenix’s descendent, the noble lady of a region. You can follow behind me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two before them, one was an exceptional talent, while the other had a similar level of combat strength. They were confident in their strength, which was why they acted so domineeringly, picking up peaches halfway. They truly had enough power to back their confidence.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao looked at them with a calm expression, not looking down on them, but not showing fear either, just treating them with an ordinary expression. He walked forward step by step to meet his enemy head on!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This invasion of others was all within their expectations. It was because the night before, him and Hong Huang stirred up the formation, causing sword energy to overflow into the heavens. This would inevitably startle many people.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he was without fear. He already become a deity, and as such, had the confidence to defeat all enemies.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“All of you, get out of here. Don’t be an irksome presence here.” Lan Yicheng shouted coldly to those behind him. After witnessing a display of intimidation, many experts were shocked into retreating, not daring to stay too close.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though the divine vine was tempting, they still needed to be alive to reap its benefits. With two exceptional talents joining hands, stopping them there, who would carelessly rush forward? That was just courting death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you two want to come up together, or do you want to take turns?” Shi Hao said indifferently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When these words sounded, not only were those in the distance shocked, even the two great exceptional talents were stupefied. Their eyes then became deep.&nbsp;</span></p>

He discovered that this youth whose divinity was not complete, his body still having some areas where the light was dim suddenly erupted with heaven overflowing blood energy.&nbsp;</span></p>

His face fell greatly. He truly made an error in judgment this time, believing that a formation master wouldn’t be all that powerful. In the end, he was actually this vicious. He wasn’t in a rush to join in the battle and provide assistance, instead still observing the battle from the rear.&nbsp;</span></p>

He didn’t feel fear, but rather a rather strange feeling. That sword was extremely special, to the extent where he really couldn’t lightly make contact with it. He felt like even a true deity would die if they were pierced by it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the blink of an eye, the two individuals’ figures continuously swapped positions.
