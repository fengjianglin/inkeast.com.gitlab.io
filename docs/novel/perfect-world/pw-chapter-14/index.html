 <p><strong>Chapter 14</strong><b> – Barbaric</b></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone from Stone Village departed quickly and arrived at the depths of the mountain range. Here, trees that touched the skies were snapped in half, thousand year old vines were destroyed, and all kinds of beast carcasses were scattered in a large mess.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two mysterious beasts were currently engaging in intense combat, stirring up great disorder and causing many ordinary beasts to die. In addition, Wolf Village once again chased away Shi Feijiao and others. This area was currently in absolute chaos.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The beast carcasses that were stacked up on a small hill were all carried away by Wolf Village and completely clear. After Shi Linghu came back to this area, he could only grit his teeth in anger; this was truly intolerable. The villagers’ hard work of gathering up the prey was all in vain. The pile of corpses was stolen just like that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chase!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They didn’t hesitate and immediately proceeded towards Wolf Village. After all, those people were carrying such heavy and enormous beasts, so they couldn’t have gotten far. They left obvious tracks in the mountains like fierce beasts’ hair, blood, and scales, which revealed the route Wolf Village took.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Careful!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Linghu who led the way waved his hand and signalled everyone to come to a halt. He pushed aside a large chunk of withered grass and leaves in front of him to reveal a large black hole. Inside the hole were many steel spears that pointed upwards. If anyone fell in, their internal organs would immediately be skewered. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“These wolf bastards are truly vicious!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone from Stone Village grew increasingly furious. This was still within their territory, yet Wolf Village acted without the slightest scruple. If this continued, a bloody disaster was inevitable. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After quickly advancing eight to nine li, a strong gust of wind suddenly blew towards Shi Linghu’s throat. As if it came straight from the underworld, a cold light flashed past with killing intent, lightning fast and terrifying one down to their soul. </span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a 1.3 meter long iron arrow. The terrifying power and speed of this projectile could undoubtedly penetrate through a Dragon Horned Elephant’s armor. Unsurprisingly, this was the reason why they were able to penetrate the three layered armor that the Stone Village men wore. It was absolutely terrifying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, from within the depths of the mountain jungle, a similarly terrifying and cold arrow shot out. It was impossible to effectively defend against it. However, the incomparably brave and fierce Shi Linghu’s reaction was swift and he quickly shifted his body to the side. </span></p>
 <p><span style>It was just too dangerous. This ice-cold iron arrow scraped his neck, carrying along a string of blood with it. A little bit of skin was ripped open by the arrowhead; just a bit closer and the arrow would have instantly bore through the neck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, a sharp scream tore through the air. This was the sound of the arrow tearing through the air and it was much slower than the arrow itself. This showed just how terrifying the speed was.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Qiang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The iron arrow did not simply insert itself into the mountain rock far away, instead going straight through it. The friction caused metallic sounds to reverberate through the air and sparks to fly everywhere. It was extremely terrifying. What kind of of tyrannical strength was this? How many people dared to take such a heavy arrow head on? Being struck by that would truly bring about a horrifying result!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The scene was absolutely silent. Shi Linghu felt the scraped skin on his neck, and his cold eyes flickered. He barely managed to avoid death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In a distant mountain range, a youth was standing while holding a bow. His expression was cold, and chilly radiance flickered through his pupils as he stared over. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s that child again!” At that moment, Shi Feijiao and the others’ anger broke through the heavens. This callous youth successively inflicted serious injuries to the capable men of the village again and again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The youth was fourteen or fifteen years in age, and he had a rather tall build with soft black shiny hair. His skin was fair and he was quite handsome, but his eyes were too cold. This took away from his beauty and gave people a type of wild and cruel feeling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Behind him, around seventy to eight people were currently dragging huge beasts, leaving behind them a trail of blood on the mountain floor. The grass and thorny undergrowth below the corpses were all crushed. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wolf Village’s little bastard, what else can you do besides shooting some vicious arrows? If you have the guts, then come over here. I’ll make sure to remove your head with a single slap!” Someone roared in anger. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The handsome youth blinked his cold eyes. He then drew his bow and aimed straight at the one who spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon seeing this, Shi Linghu did not utter a single word. He raised the large black bow made of dragon horn that was half a person in length and quickly drew back his bowstring. After placing an iron arrow on the bow, he directly shot it out.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Dang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Two thick arrows collided in midair, causing sparks to fly out and extremely sharp ear piercing sounds to ring through the air. The two arrows cancelled out each other before falling straight to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone gasped. That youth’s skill in archery was too abnormal. He wasn’t even twenty years of age yet, yet he was able to fight toe to toe with the village’s strongest male, Shi Linghu.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Qiang, Qiang…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>In the forest, sparks flew in all directions. Over ten iron arrows collided, releasing metallic sounds. Like falling stars, they dropped from the skies to the ground. The noise was so loud it made the ears of those present ache.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These powerful arrows shocked the wasteland forest!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The strongest male in the village, Shi Linghu, was evenly matched when faced with this youth, neither having an edge over the other. This left the crowd shocked. If this youth used both his arms, he could probably lift up a copper cauldron weighing at least five to six thousand jin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This made people suck in a breath of cold air. What a formidable genius! He was a younger generation youth, yet he was able to produce such shocking godlike strength. This made people fear for their lives.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Friends from Stone Village, forgive us. This time we require a large amount of ferocious beasts. Give us the prey this time, and we will pay you back in the future.” A middle aged man appeared and yelled out in a loud and clear voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In order to steal our prey, you ran our clansman out of our own territory with such viciousness. The arrows you shot injured our internal organs and gravely injured so many, yet you ask us to forgive you all? You all act with such ill will, yet you try to maintain such a calm composure. Where are your principles?!” Shi Linhu angrily berated. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Once we argue, conflict will spark and blood will naturally flow. This is something all men surviving in the great wilderness understand.” The leader of Wolf Village’s hunting team said. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“We refuse, so why don’t you just give us everything you got?!” Another robust individual from Wolf Village whose status wasn’t low spoke in an even tougher manner. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The people from Stone Village all felt as if they were going to explode from anger. Wolf Village had already ruthlessly attacked and stole Stone Village’s prey, and now they they continued to act in such an overbearing manner without speaking even a bit of reason. There truly wasn’t anything left to discuss. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then a war it is!” Shi Feijiao bellowed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You think we are scared of you all?” Replied the captain of Wolf Village’s hunting team. His appearance was quite imposing, and with a height of over two meters, he gave off an oppressing aura.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Qiang, Qiang…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The sound of weapons clashing rang unceasingly. Many raised their broadswords that were roughly half their height. Cold radiance flickered and murderous aura permeated the air. The power produced by the attacks caused the leaves in the forest to scatter down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We urge you to return to where you came from. If you dare take another step, I will shoot all of you down one arrow per person. This time there won’t be any mercy shown!” The handsome youth from Wolf Village said. His words made Stone Village’s people furious, and some of them truly wished that an arrow would tear through him first. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Linghu angrily said, “Little bastard, you haven’t even fully matured, yet you possess such skill You really are quite strong, but if you act so domineering and behave so viciously, it won’t end well for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, he drew back his bow and directly fired the arrow. Since the discussions had already reached this state, what else was there that could be done? There could only be war!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Dang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The iron arrows collided once again, causing the forest to shake with noise. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kill!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone from Stone Village drew back their huge bows, raised their broadswords, and brandished their wolf-toothed clubs. Like a wave of vicious beasts, they brought with them a frantic gale as they rushed out. Their actions caused leaves to fly about chaotically. </span></p>
 <p><span style>As for those from Wolf Village, they were all tall, strong, and incredibly tough. They also rushed over. A chaotic battle was about to break out. </span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time, a small silhouette similar to a small sparrow rapidly dashed to the front, yelling out in a loud voice, “You all steal our food and even kill uncles and the others! Uncle A’Fu and others are so nice and kind, but they were almost killed. You are all big bad guys!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Hao’s little face was flushed red from being stirred up. His little hands were clasped tightly together, and his eyes were filled with a fury. Since childhood, he had been raised in Stone Village, surrounded by its warmth and comfort. Never before had he faced such barbaric people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone within Wolf Village was startled. Then, they began to roar with laughter. They never expected that apart from some of the almost grown-up kids, Stone Village even had this type of little child that followed along. Wasn’t he just causing troubles for his clansmen?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Xiu!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>An iron arrow tore through the air. The fourteen or fifteen year old Wolf Village youth’s face remained cold. He drew back that terrifying large bow and directly released an arrow at the little guy. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Flames shot out from the eyes of Stone Village’s people. They were angered to their limit. That was still a child! The little guy was normally so lovable and cute, yet the other party’s viciousness didn’t even spare a young child. Their hair stood up from fury. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Linghu armed his bow with a large arrow at once, destroying that youth’s iron arrow with his. However, his expression immediately changed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was because this time, the youth shot four arrows at once. Four streaks of cold light flew through the air with lightning speed, but Shi Linghu only had enough time to break three arrows. The enemy was even stronger than he had imagined.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Dang, Dang…</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Among them, three arrows collided together, dropping straight to the floor. There was still another 1.3 meter long large iron arrow heading straight towards the little guy’s throat. The coldness of the arrow was truly terrifying!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little guy used his hands to grab the iron arrow, leaving the villagers utterly frightened. They shouted out loudly, “Hurry up and move out of the way!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They knew that Shi Hao was blessed with incredible natural talent, but in the end, he wasn’t even four years old! Even though he lifted up a copper cauldron that weighed a thousand jin, his opponent was much older, and his power was even more astonishing, enough to raise five or six cauldrons. He could contend with Shi Linghu in terms of strength. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You won’t even let a child go?!” The people from Stone Village felt like their eye sockets were splitting open.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Dang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, what was even more shocking was that the little guy’s left hand chopped down on the arrow’s shaft, sending it flying out in a slanted manner. It left the crowd tongue-tied for words and completely speechless. </span></p>
 <p><span style>There were only a few people who had seen a symbol flashing on his palm before it rapidly faded away.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Whoosh.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The little guy jumped forward and directly threw himself towards that youth from Wolf Village!</span></p>
