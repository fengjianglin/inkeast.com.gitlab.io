That young devil king was too hateful, doing things in an unbridled manner. His bearing was unrestrained, completely not treating them with importance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Forget about others, just the sect masters’ faces fell. They truly wished they could slap him to death with a single palm. It was absolutely preposterous.&nbsp;</span></p>

What a bunch of nonsense! If he wants to lead us inside to chase after him, it is just too childish.” The old woman in golden feather clothes spoke. She was the Golden Luan’s sect master.&nbsp;</span></p>

They were mocked and ridiculed by the young devil king -- Huang, making their faces devoid of light. Their bodies were shrouded in mist, and killing intent pervaded the air.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The crowd were all discussing passionately. Everything that happened today happened suddenly. It was just a youth, yet he challenged all of the sects without the slightest sense of respect for authority. He was just too reckless!</span></p>

In the following days, the young devil king Huang was going to become the focal point of every sect’s discussion. He would become an extremely well known figure in the higher realms.&nbsp;</span></p>

If one entered rashly, there was a high chance of their body and spirit being wiped out!</span></p>

Its dao skills were profound. It was a tree, but at this moment, it turned into a black clothed old man. It supported a sphere of dark light that resisted the chaotic streams in space.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The passageway in space was extremely unstable.&nbsp;</span></p>

There were large cracks. A single mishap would result in the destruction of one’s body.&nbsp;</span></p>

They were moving through an unstable passageway. They saw a Green Flood Dragon that was over a thousand zhang in length. It definitely exceeded the Divine Flame Realm, but its corpse was ice cold. The upper half of its body had long been severed to who knows where by the great cracks of the void.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They moved quickly. Hazy mists fluttered about around them, as if they had entered primal chaos.</span></p>

They could cut down deities. There was a pile of ruined bones nearby, and all of them were experts that had encountered accidents while crossing the void.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fifteen minutes later, Shi Hao was shocked to find an ancient black boat in the void’s large cracks. It was dyed in blood, drifting about through the boundless void.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For some reason, the instant they saw it, they felt flustered. It was as if they were suffocating.</span></p>

Even individuals as powerful as them were surrounded by the shadow of death, as if they would immediately die.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is that?” Grandpa Fifteen frowned.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Quiet!” The Devil Blood Ghost Tree was extremely nervous. All of its fine hairs stood on end. It carefully moved through the cracks of the void without a word, quickly bringing these two into the distance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only after an unknown amount of time had passed did he release a breath of air. There was unexpectedly sweat on his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I had heard from Origin Sky Supreme Being that while traveling through the void, upon losing one’s way in the great cracks, the most terrifying thing is encountering the blood dyed ancient black boats, as well as the mist shrouded chaotic palaces and terrifying flying immortal marvels.” The Devil Blood Ghost Tree explained.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those three things and scenes had existed since the ancient times. They were the most strange, and even if old sect masters entered, they would undoubtedly die.&nbsp;</span></p>

This was truly quite the ‘luck’. Fortunately, they were still far away and didn’t get too close, or else they would have undoubtedly been in great danger!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Millions of millions of creatures had traveled through the void, yet no one had seen it. We managed to experience quite an uncommon journey.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There wasn’t really anything unexpected afterwards. The void was unstable, but they were more scared than hurt. They quickly made their way to the other end of the spatial gap’s ‘road’.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soon after, white light flashed. They broke free through another unstable ‘gap’ and arrived in the outside great world.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Scarlet red magma illuminated their view. The scorching temperature was so great it could turn people into ashes. This was a group of volcanoes. Waves of heat roiled, and a heavy sulfuric smell assailed the nostrils.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was clearly a dangerous place. There was no plant life, a place that was lacking life force overall. There were many volcanoes that released black smoke and enormous mountains that had magma flowing out from within.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s part ways here. This place is not suitable for me to stay extensively in,” said the Devil Blood Ghost Tree. It was, after all, a plant type of creature. This place made it feel rather uncomfortable.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior, goodbye!” Shi Hao cupped his fist as he watched it leave through the air.&nbsp;</span></p>

This seemed a bit unreal. They were just in the little thousand world within Five Elements Province, but now, they were likely already several tens of millions of li away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What kind of place was this? Was it even the same province? The grandfather and grandson pair were at a loss. They had no concept of location right now, not knowing where they were at all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao was shocked. His grandfather really was doughty, directly throwing himself into the volcanic crater. That place was crimson red with roiling heat. Red magma surged!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Grandfather, are you okay?”</span></p>

The Great Demonic God emerged from the volcanic crater as if he was just taking a bath. His face was red, and heat surged from his hair.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am fine!” Grandpa Fifteen spoke. He devoured the Demonic Sovereign’s true blood and always had yin energy within his body that could only be suppressed and alleviated a bit by strong alcohol.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Grandfather, I will definitely find divine level little devil wine for you!” Shi Hao said. Perhaps only that level of precious wine could expel the yin energy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No harm. I feel like after cultivating the Lightning Emperor’s method, my body will become better and better. Things will improve sooner or later.” The Great Demonic God said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao nodded and said, “That makes sense too. I’ll look around to see what kind of place this is first, and then let’s go into isolation to cultivate the second page of the golden sheet.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then, he and the Great Demonic God took action. They searched through this place to get to the bottom of what kind of place this was.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was an extremely barren plateau. It covered an extensive area of hundreds of thousands of li. There weren’t many traces of inhabitation. They only found a few mortals after searching several tens of thousands of li.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The living conditions here were extremely harsh, so they didn’t see many powerful creatures. It was because this wasn’t some great cultivation place, lacking spiritual medicines, lakes, and green hills.&nbsp;</span></p>

The land was barren. There weren’t really any cultivation inheritances across the boundless plateau.&nbsp;</span></p>

They truly didn’t know how far it was from Five Elements Province. After asking around, they found that those mortals didn’t know any other provinces.&nbsp;</span></p>

They fought unendingly, their vicious energy overflowed into the heavens, and that was why Demon Province got this name.&nbsp;</span></p>

An ancient great figure had once spat out a streak of flames that burned through everything.&nbsp;</span></p>

There was another important reason, and that was that Demonic Sunflower Garden was located in this province.</span></p>

They had fought a great battle even in the lower realm. Only death could get rid of this grudge. The descent of the seven deities into the lower realm was even more so because of this race’s involvement.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Apart from this, he had also killed a young outstanding talent from Demonic Sunflower Garden in Origin Sky Secret Realm!</span></p>

On the contrary, there were many great sects and countless magnificent mountains and rivers, especially where Demonic Sunflower Garden was located. Heavenly essence and auspicious energy flowed through that place year round.&nbsp;</span></p>

It will be too difficult to return!” Shi Hao sighed and said. They only learned of this after asking around for a long time.</span></p>
