 <p><strong>Chapter 165 - Little Devil Wine</strong></p>
 <p><span style>“To actually dare steal my divine medicine, have you all forgotten what happened to your ancestors?” This golden monkey was extremely overbearing. It pointed its golden battle spear forward and faced the opposing parties.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shitty monkey, hand over your life!” Fiery light overflowed into the heavens, and the entirely scarlet Mang Ox rushed over. Magma surged, and everywhere it treaded upon turned into boiling scarlet liquid, raising the temperature to an extremely high degree. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“A Mang Ox isn’t good enough to be my opponent. A small cow like you even wanna flip the wind and waves? You aren’t going to go after pure-blooded creatures, and instead have your eyes on me, you truly picked a route of death!” The divine monkey’s temper exploded. Golden light overflowed from its body in all four directions, and with a single leap, it directly rose several hundred zhang into the air. It used the golden battle spear like a large rod and thrashed out downwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With a </span><i><span style>dong</span></i><span style> sound, the scarlet magma on the ground surged like a huge wave, rising several hundred zhang into the air. The golden battle spear smashed with a </span><i><span style>kengqiang </span></i><span style>sound into a scarlet blade.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The demonic cow changed forms and stood up in human form. With a giant blood-colored blade in its hands, it fiercely collided with the divine monkey. However, it was actually forced backwards. After coughing out blood continuously, it shouted, “What are you all waiting for? Take down that monkey and the four stalks of divine medicine by the pure land’s spiritual lake will be ours!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the sky, rainbow colored divine light flickered. A huge peacock swooped down towards the depths of the mountain range. It did not participate in the fight, but instead directly rushed towards the spiritual lake to seize the divine medicine.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rise!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The monkey shouted loudly, and with a </span><i><span style>hong </span></i><span style>sound, the spear smashed down. The scarlet Mang Ox’s expression changed, because it was left with no choice but to resist with all its strength. As a result, the divine monkey was able to borrow this strength to soar into the air. It sat on top of a multi-colored giant bird and chased after the Rainbow Peacock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a loud rumbling sound, the Mang Ox roared loudly. The earth beneath its feet cracked apart, and at the same time, magma surged like a huge wave, covering its body. It continuously retreated while blood dripped out of its mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Monkey, you are too overbearing. Back then, you killed so many of our ancestors and seized the divine medicine without leaving behind even a single stalk. After acting like this, did you truly not fear the kings all coming after you?” Shouted the Rainbow Peacock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It opened its mouth and spat out a precious imprint. It circulated with symbols as it flew over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The weak will serve and the strong will rule. It has always been this way, and if I wasn’t strong enough, I would have been eaten by other creatures a long time ago. There isn’t much to say about this.” The golden monkey’s body was not large, but it was imposing and bold. The golden battle lance in its hands pierced forward, causing a multitude of golden light to burst forth. With a </span><i><span style>qiang</span></i><span style> sound, sparks flew everywhere and divine multicolored light surged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The precious imprint flipped around as it flew out, continuously growing in size. Finally, it smashed apart a strip of the mountain range, emitting an expanse of auspicious color.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kill!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the distance, a golden great Peng flew over. As it spread its wings to take to the skies, its massive body could clearly be seen. Its firm and fierce body emitted golden bright and resplendent light as it directly used its divine wings to sweep over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With a </span><i><span style>honglong</span></i><span style> sound, the entire heaven and earth seemed like it was about to shatter. Its physique was powerful and unmatched. As it looked at that monkey, it felt as if it was looking at an ant.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hou!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The golden monkey released a roar and jumped off of the multicolored giant bird. Its body quickly grew large, and it looked like a golden mountain as it stood up within the mountain region.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This type of aura and forcefulness completely shocked all of the kings stiff. They all began to feel somewhat scared and upset. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The monkey was incomparably divine and brave. A fist smashed down on the great Peng’s wings, causing golden divine light to burst forth. A </span><i><span style>honglong</span></i><span style> sound rang out between the two individuals, creating a violent gale that engulfed the mountains and rivers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rubble and broken pieces of wood all swirled up together. It was like a tornado, causing sand to fly and stones to roll. This entire mountain range was in utter chaos as it violently began to shake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Golden Winged Peng’s body was tyrannical; however, after the divine monkey used its precious method, it became equally lofty and powerful. Its combat strength was unrivalled, and it was impossible to resist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So powerful!” In the distance, the big red bird withdrew its neck. These two giants were too powerful, and their cultivation realms far surpassed its own.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s the </span><span style><span>Heavenly Law and Earth!” The little guy’s large eyes shone as he stared at the monkey’s powerful physical body. Speaking to himself, he said, “What a pity. The symbols within Hairy Ball<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> were destroyed; otherwise, my comprehension would be more profound, allowing me to understand more!”</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>With a </span><i><span style>weng</span></i><span style> sound, the great Golden Winged Peng circled around before swooping over once again. It spat out a golden divine sword that was circulating with auspicious multicolored light, and shot it out towards the monkey.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The divine monkey sneered. With the battle spear that similarly grew in size, it sprinted forward. Symbols erupted everywhere; this was a confrontation carrying the force of the dao and law.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Dang</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The sharp and clear metallic sounds shook everyone’s bodies until they began to sway back and forth. Divine multicolored light shot out in all directions due to both precious artifacts emitting light. All types of mysterious symbols radiated, and in addition, the powerful force caused the entire mountain range to shake, making numerous tree leaves shatter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The monkey bared its fangs, revealed a mouthful of snow white fierce teeth. It stamped on the ground and directly soared into the skies. Brandishing its battle spear in his hands, it smashed down on the opponent in front of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, after enduring the fierce collision, the great Golden Winged Peng exhausted a severe amount of divine strength. It almost lost control over the golden divine sword, and was sent flying together with its owner outwards. After seeing the divine monkey follow up with another attack, it couldn’t help but release a roar. Its wings moved, activating its primitive symbols. Transforming into a blazing wheel, it charged downwards.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hong</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The great Peng coughed out blood, and its body flew outwards. Cold light shot through the divine monkey’s eyes, and it quickly shrunk. It fell down on the multicolored giant bird and looked disdainfully in all directions.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chi</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, a streak of black wind swept over. A Hou appeared, and its body was entirely pitch black. Symbols radiated as it soared into the sky to kill the monkey.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“None of you are worthy of being my opponent. Unless that old fellow whose already at death’s door comes, don’t even think about trying!” The divine monkey coldly laughed. It opened its mouth to release a hiss, spewing out a golden colored gale. The wind was sharp like blades, cutting apart the mountain ridge in front of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The black Hou roared, and its entire body was in sharp pain as bloody scars appeared on its body. The black light it released also struck the monkey’s body; however, it did not inflict any injuries. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You dare!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The divine monkey roared, and while riding the multicolored giant bird, it rushed towards the pure land. It was extremely enraged, and its battle spear was like a windmill as it murderously charged towards the Rainbow Peacock.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kengqiang </span></i><span style>sounds rang out incessantly as the enormous Peacock released an expanse of feathers. Rainbow colored light shot out streak after streak, and they were all its feathers. They turned into divine swords as they hacked over, falling in front of the monkey and multicolored giant bird’s bodies. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The divine monkey angrily roared. Its entire body erupted in precious light, protecting itself and its mount. An enormous curtain of light was constructed, blocking all of the incoming feather divine swords. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kill!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Following that, he thrusted the spear out. The tip of the spear became adorned with stars, as if an ocean of stars were moving. This powerful strike actually carried with it the imagery of the milky way falling. </span></p>
 <p><span style>With a </span><i><span style>pu</span></i><span style> sound, many feathers shattered. The Rainbow Peacock recalled the mountain sized precious imprint and blocked the spear. However, it was still shaken to a point where it coughed out large amounts of blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everyone, we need to go up together. Ignore the divine medicine for now, because if the monkey doesn’t die, even the Heavens won’t be able to tolerate it. Have you all forgotten how it murdered our ancestors?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>An entirely silver white creature whose body was covered in thorns rushed over. It had a flood dragon head, hedgehog body, and crocodile tail; it was a ferocious Thorn Beast!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was obvious that this was an extremely aged Archaic descendant that was powerful to the extreme. Silver flying swords shot out from all over its body to block off and kill the monkey.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With its roar, the Golden Winged Peng, Rainbow Peacock, Black Hou, Mang Ox and other kings all grouped up and came over. They were currently carrying out a group battle against the divine monkey, wanting to kill it together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This region immediately began to boil. This one battle made the heaven and earth lose light, and caused the sun and moon to lose color. The mountain range trembled, and a great catastrophe arrived.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These creatures were too powerful, especially the divine monkey. The more it fought, the more brave it became. It did not have any fear, as if it possessed unlimited strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Too powerful! This monkey is terrifying after all. If it truly gave everything it had into this fight and fought with its life on the line, it would be even more powerful than an emperor that cultivated for several hundred years!” A restricted individual beside Huo Ling’er said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Fire Nation princess nodded her head. This divine monkey was a mixed descendant, but through countless years, its cultivation gradually grew deeper. Now, it truly reached a great level, and was a creature that was worth the human emperor personally taking action against.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They infiltrated the pure land and are making their move.” The Nine-Headed Lion was carefully observing the Bifang, Horned Dragon, and the rest of their group this entire time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s not important. The other monkeys aren’t easy to deal with either.” The mischievous stone spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sure enough, when the group of experts entered, a group of golden monkeys became alarmed. The ground flickered with symbols, and restrictions emitted light. Tens became hundreds as the monkeys charged out together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are these monkeys so powerful?” The little guy was shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within the group of monkeys, there was surprisingly not a single weak member. They cried out with </span><i><span style>aoao </span></i><span style>sounds and revealed their fierce teeth. Their bodies emitted dazzling golden light as they encircled the intruders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In particular, every single leader’s fighting strength was astonishing. The pure-blooded creatures were chased until they became terrified, because the monkeys’ cultivation levels surpassed theirs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right at that time, the Demonic Cattail Tree began to move, and the Crack Demonic Butterfly as well as Shi Yi appeared. They began to charge murderously into the group of monkeys, because they also wanted to seize the four small stalks of divine medicine.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With a </span><i><span style>shua </span></i><span style>sound, purple light flickered. The purple-haired girl made her move, and in her hand was a golden horn. With a light stroke, the entire symbol formation was disposed of, and she quickly rushed forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the distance, the divine monkey’s pupils were cold. It fought with everyone while keeping an eye on the pure land. A ruthless smile could be seen from its lips. “Pure-blooded creatures, I like!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The creatures fighting with it were even more shocked. If they were able to kill this monkey, then today’s harvest would be simply too great. Other than the four stalks of divine medicine, there was also a Horned Dragon, Zhujian, and others! This was simply an irresistible enticement.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hong</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Several dozen stolons rushed over like hornless dragons. All of them emitted scarlet multicolored light, locking up the monkey. The Ironblood Ancient Tree appeared as well, and it also wanted to seize the divine medicine; as a result, it made its move against the divine monkey.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We should make our moves as well. Be careful not to be detected. We are going to take advantage of this crisis,” the Divine Striking Stone suggested.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The group all agreed. The little guy already took out the heaven and earth pouch in preparation of collecting treasure at any time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huo Ling’er was graceful and elegant, and was absolutely gorgeous. She personally steered the divine blanket refined from beast skin. Wordless and uncommunicative, they entered the pure land without being detected.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right at this time, the small wolf in the Fire Nation Princess became restless. It continuously struggled and moved about before ultimately jumping onto the little guy’s body. Suspending itself off his body like a koala, it continuously breathed in and out. Following that, it tugged on the devilish brat’s hair, pointing toward a direction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That area was close to the spiritual lake, and there was an expanse of ancient trees. They were all incomparably tall, and light shone from the tree’s bodies. It gave birth to a spiritual medicine that resembled a monkey head.</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>“Lion’s Mane<a id="footnoteref-2" href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>!” Huo Ling’er was astonished.</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>These mushrooms were all shining. They grew on the the tree trunk, and were all sparkling and translucent. While emitting spiritual essence, there were more than ten in number, all of them extremely gorgeous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rumor has it that it is a rare delicacy on par with lion head and tiger bone soup. After being refined into precious medicine, I believe the Lion’s Mane will become extremely delicious.” The little guy’s eyes were fixed on them as he quickly wiped off his saliva.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You all wait over here. I’ll go and collect them!” The little guy jumped off the divine rug and carefully made his way over. The ancient trees grew densely, and since the divine blanket was rather large, it was impossible for the rest of them to travel that deep.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Without alarming any enemies, he directly arrived in front of these ancient trees. He was incomparably happy and was about to pick them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the little wolf, on the contrary, seemed rather anxious. It stopped him, moreover jumping onto the ground to dig up part of an old tree trunk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With a </span><i><span style>hong </span></i><span style>sound, the little wolf was sent flying. That thick old tree trunk shone, revealing terrifying symbols.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Wuwu</span></i><span style>…” The little wolf became worried, hinting for the little guy to quickly make his move. There seemed to be some kind of priceless object within the tree trunk. It didn’t even act like this when it saw the Immortal Peach Tree.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little guy did not say anything more and took out the broken sword, slashing outward. The symbols on the tree’s body were immediately shattered. Afterwards, he struck the ancient tree, only to find that it made a hollow sound.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chi</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He used the broken sword to cut apart a small hole. Immediately, a wave of strong fragrance overflowed, making people feel a bit intoxicated. The young deity immediately widened its eyes and became incredibly happy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the little guy saw this, he immediately enlarged the hole in the tree. As a result, dense multicolored light rushed out and a strong fragrance assailed his nostrils. It transformed into divine light and submerged this area.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The hole in the tree was full of liquid. It was sparkling and transparent like exquisite wine, the fragrance making people feel as if they were becoming drunk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little Devil Juice! It’s a exceptional type of precious medicine!” From on top of the divine blanket, Huo Ling’er widened her eyes from incomparable shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little guy already had the heaven and earth pouch out during the first moments, turning it into a heavenly curtain to isolate this area. He feared that the rich fragrance would startle other creatures.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is this a type of wine? It seems like something that would taste really good.” He did not know the value of the Little Devil Wine, and while leaning on the tree, he drank a small sip. Suddenly, he felt as if the sky was spinning and the earth was turning, almost becoming completely intoxicated. In addition, the fragrance flooded his body, making countless rays of multicolored light gush out from his pores.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Such powerful medicinal effects!” The little guy was shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this instant, he could sense the flavor of many precious medicines; for example, the Scarlet Orchid, Black Jade Lotus, Snow Jade Ginseng, Scarlet Flood Dragon Vine, and others. They were all extremely strong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was made from spirit medicines?!” The little guy stared with his eyes wide. His felt his heart tremble, because this was definitely an absolutely priceless and rare treasure!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Wu</span></i><span style>, there is still a partly peachy flavor.” He recognized the flavor, and couldn’t help but look towards the Immoral Peach Trees in the distance. Could it be that the Little Devil Wine had some of the silver immortal peaches inside?</span></p>
 <p><span style>This… Truly was worth a terrifying amount!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The little guy believed that he would be able to break through the ninth Heavenly Passage soon. It would be extremely beneficial for his body, and who knows, it might even be able to restore a bit of the Supreme Being Bone!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The liquid from this tree hole was not inferior to those four Immortal Peach Trees. It truly was an opportunity that was difficult to imagine possible.</span></p>
