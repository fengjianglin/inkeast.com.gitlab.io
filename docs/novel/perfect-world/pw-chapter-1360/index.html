 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This monument had existed for at least a great era. The truth it revealed made everyone’s minds tremble, all of them couldn't help but feel shocked!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Victory, there is still hope. However, the path of return has already been severed. All those heroic and worthy predecessors, their bones buried in desolation. My generation continues the path of old, our fates already sealed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This segment gave one a great headache, to the extent where they even felt a horrified feeling. The negative feeling the carved inscriptions gave off was clear, what it spoke about was extremely astonishing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After they came to this realm, they couldn’t return anymore? Why was this? What were the secrets behind this? The most crucial issue was, where did he come from? There was a layer of dense fog surrounding this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From this, one could see that he wasn’t the first one to come, that there were predecessors. This also explained his fate, that in the end, he was still going to die.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, did he fall in battle, or did he die in a seated posture here?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that level, he should have already achieved immortality, he shouldn’t decline on his own. That was why the people here deduced that this person’s intention was that he was going to die in battle in the end!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a bit horrifying, history was far more terrifying than what they imagined. There were too many mysteries hidden within this, at the very least, not even Great Elder Meng Tianzheng knew anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was even less of a need to talk about Shi Hao, Great Xu Tuo, Exiled Immortal, Daoist Qi Gu, and the others. That person’s point of view was extremely pessimistic, carrying a type of fatalistic feel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And if nothing unexpected happened, the one who had to fight was Ancestor Luo Mo!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just how powerful of an expert was this? There was a bit of primal chaos blood, yet in the end, he left behind this type of bleak message. It was as if a wave of chilly autumn wind blew past, all creatures killed, large amounts of yellow leaves withering away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A small slumber, and a hundred thousand years pass. When the eyes open once more, the blue sea has turned into mulberry fields. Is this a tragic death, or is it a meaningful price? I do not know. I am not an administrator, and as such I cannot see the chessboard. I can only break the player’s finger, but what about afterwards? What could I possibly do then?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When it reached this point, the writer was clearly already somewhat at a loss. For the dao heart of someone at that level to waver, just how terrifying were things?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps his heart was already in chaos, suspecting whether or not what he persevered with even had any meaning, only then would there be these thoughts. For those of later generations, the impact of this was extremely great.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Yi, Cao Yusheng, Lan Xian, and others all looked at each other in dismay, their expressions all serious. Even though they were young, they still came to their own conclusions. The truth had perhaps been buried under the dust of history this entire time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why did the path of an immortal have to be severed here? Was there really a need to do this? To be so negative, so helpless, if things went on like this, was this a depravation, or is this a type of satisfaction with just being able to get through?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The day will come when you will discover, wake from a great dream, that all of time is nothing, what will come will come. Avoiding it only brings a momentary feeling of peace!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What was the meaning of this? Great Elder frowned. He carefully analyzed everything he saw, discussing with the youngsters, not minding the difference in status between them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This should be a type of discontent targeted at the so-called land of beginning, at those administrators, a type of discontent with their passiveness.” In the end, they interpreted things like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they carefully thought about this, this was extremely terrifying, as if it was a type of great disaster. In the end, it would all erupt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What kind of people were there? What was the place they were from like? The feeling they gave off was that they were a power that could defeat the foreign side’s troops. However they also seemed to have some private worries. Why was this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was someone with a bit of primal chaos blood, this person definitely an unmatched expert. From his words, the fact that he dared to write breaking the administrators’ finger was definitely an expression of a type of confidence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who dares cross the sea, who dares charge through?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“When that day comes, people won’t be people, ghosts not ghosts, immortals not immortals, the heavens would all be overturned. Perhaps, only this is the true rebirth, the end of a reincarnation, as well as a type of origin.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he read up to this point, even Great Elder Meng Tianzheng felt a wave of nervousness, a stifling feeling inside. In the end, it was as if a black haze pervaded over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Crossing the sea? Cross what sea?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How were they supposed to charge through? What place was this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone felt a wave of perplexity while staring at these words, not understanding what was happening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone’s understandings of this was different, but they all knew that the day would come when there would be great chaos. When they thought about the prophecy that history’s darkest of times were arriving, every single person’s mind was heavy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They all looked down, however, they didn’t recognize the words. Those were like scribblings, ancient characters of a certain race. There was actually chaotic energy released from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before this, the so-called characters were all written in Immortal Ancient language. Even though they didn’t belong to this great era, what kind of people were the ones here? They had mostly all studied Immortal Ancient methods somewhat, so they could naturally understand, learning these things before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, these words were too strange. They released chaotic energy, no one able to recognize them, even Great Elder helpless, unable to understand anything, even after studying them for a long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the other side, the foreign side were also discussing things quietly. It had to be said that these people were extremely strong, with some who were proficient in Immortal Ancient language as well. They explained everything they understood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Haha…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">what negative carvings, full of powerlessness and bleakness. My side’s dao fate is prosperous, our power fated to crush the heavens. All those who defy us are nothing more than chickens and dogs.” Someone laughed loudly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, there were foreign elders who became silent, their expressions incredibly gloomy. It was because what was recorded was a bit strange. They couldn’t see through the inscriptions even after studying them for a really long time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bring them back, let the ancient ancestors see it. They will definitely be able to understand the truth.” Someone said. It was because these were the inscriptions carved by Luo Mo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Stop!” Great Elder stopped them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both sides wanted this monument, which meant that a battle was unavoidable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The iron blood war banner fluttered about, scarlet multicolored light overflowing outwards, smashing into the brilliance released by that Immortal Smelting Pot. With a&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">peng</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;sound, this battlefield even caved in, many great stars that fell here breaking apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, that monument remained completely silent, melting under the blazing radiance like snow, disappearing without a trace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though the engravings were made by an unmatched figure, there was no trace of him left, destroyed just like that, turning into dust.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both sides released a cold snort, no longer attacking each other. They then quickly rushed into the battlefield depths. They obtained so much information just from a monument they found on the ancient battlefield, so they believed that there were definitely all types of clues up ahead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“My ancestor should have come from the same place as the one who carved the inscriptions.” Dugu Yun said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone’s expressions couldn’t help but become serious. The protectors came from the same mysterious place, there were just too many mysteries tied to this!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In reality, they already had their suspicions. The protectors’ clan might only be a powerful clan, there should still be other exceptional races.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was extremely frightening!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">En?</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">” Suddenly, thousands of li out, there were waves of black haze that rose. Then, the foreign side’s people were stirred up and furious, crying out loudly, rushing over.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were large amounts of immortal mountains that extended out who knew how many tens of thousands of li.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was because the two groups of people arrived in the depths of the great earth one after the other.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This mountain range reached seventy to eighty thousand zhang in height, as if it was as tall as the heavens.</span></p>
