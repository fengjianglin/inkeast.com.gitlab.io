Many cracks appeared on his body as soon as he walked out a few steps, and blood immediately began to flow outwards. Half of his body became red. His injuries were terrifyingly severe.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was just like a broken piece of delicate chinaware. Even though he had been pieced together, the slightest movements might cause the fragments to separate.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao’s expression was drab, lacking vitality. Blood was even trickling out from the area between his brows. His body was in an extremely terrible state. How was he supposed to travel this long journey? It was quite likely that he would die along the way.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He sat on the ground, holding that willow branch and focusing all of his attention on absorbing and refining it. All of the tender shoots came off, entering his body. The branch was also breaking apart into green light to nourish his flesh and bones.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soon after, the entire willow branch disappeared. A bit of color returned to his face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There is the natural law of life inside this vigorous vitality?” He was shocked. He felt a mighty force from this willow branch. There was a natural law after all!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only, this ruined natural law was finite, with most of it a type of divine medicine like life essence and not the natural laws and symbols of orderly power.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite this being the case, Shi Hao still felt quite a bit better. Many of his body’s injuries closed, and all of his bones merged together, slowly growing again as if they were going to merge back together.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He inspected himself again. After remaining silent for a long time, he then released a light sigh. Immortal Palace’s natural law was still there, and its destructive force was incessantly battering his body. If this continued, he was still going to fall. There was no way for him to bring it under permanent control!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In addition, he discovered that a few special symbols appeared on his flesh and bones. When he carefully inspected them, they were like copper rust, rough and mottled green.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was piece of rust from the bronze immortal palace that had been refined into a curse symbol. It was strange and mysterious. Once it made contact with someone, that individual would inevitably fall.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it were not for this branch that was full of life force left behind by the Willow Deity, he would have died a long time ago.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite this being the case, this branch could only recombine his flesh and bones. It couldn’t cure this curse. As such, if this persisted, he would definitely become weak and die under torment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The entire branch was refined. My vitality has improved a bit temporarily, but I don’t have much time. I have to make the most of it.” He staggered outwards. He found the bronze precious case nearby, as well as a few damaged and broken weapons.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, his losses were disastrous!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the desperate battle reached that state, he was truly left with no choice. Even he himself was ruined and his supreme being bone blasted apart, let alone these weapons.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Every step he took sent great pain to his chest. Cold sweat poured outwards. The supreme being bone had already broken apart, and even though it had been pieced together, only two-thirds remained.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This left him in an extremely critical condition. Back then, he had already lost his supreme being bone once and almost died as a result. This was his foundation, the root of his dao. If he lost it again, it was the same as losing his origin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The only fortunate thing was that the strand of divine blood was still there, precisely the blood that nourished the supreme being bone. Otherwise, if this was lost too, he could forget about everything else, because his body would have immediately withered away and entered the most terrifying state.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had experienced this before, during his youth!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao thought to himself as he walked. “Willow Deity had said before that once I reach a certain realm, the bone in my body will only become shackles that will hold me back.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was trying to decide whether or not to directly guide the supreme being blood to all parts of his body, no longer having it nourish this bone and instead instilling it into every bone in his body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was an extremely reckless idea. Doing this was the same as abandoning his supreme being bone. No one knew what would be the result of attempting something like this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Shi Hao quickly shook his head. He didn’t have much time and couldn’t afford to torment himself like this. If he did this, he might immediately pass away.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, the supreme being bone was too important. It was where his foundation rested. If he acted rashly, no longer nourishing it with the divine blood, there would definitely be huge problems.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Time to leave.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao staggered forward. Then, he flew into the sky, rushing into the distance. Blood continuously flowed out from the corners of his lips. As soon as he used divine force, pain would erupt from all parts of his body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This situation was definitely not good. He doubted whether or not he would even meet his loved ones before his death. He might not reach where he wished to go at all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yi</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">, who is the one that just left?

When they entered the mountain range, they were immediately stupefied. The ruins left behind by the great battle were just too terrifying! Many mountains were turned into ashes, and many high peaks shattered. A divine battle clearly took place here!</span></p>

Where exactly was he supposed to go? He had just left Stone Country not long ago and met his close relatives. Right now, he really wished to see his parents one last time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, after leaving for so many years, they didn’t even stay together that many days. In the end, blood is still thicker than water. Right now, he truly wished to remain by his parents side for a while. Afterwards, he would leave and find himself a place of final rest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He sped along, his first destination was Stone Country Imperial Capital so he could use its altar.

Their bodies trembled uncontrollably. What was going on with the Human Emperor? His entire body was covered in injuries, and he was close to death.&nbsp;</span></p>

An emperor of a country being injured to this degree was truly a terrifying and shocking sight.&nbsp;</span></p>

He handed the broken country protecting divine halberd and broken true deity magical sword over to them.&nbsp;</span></p>
