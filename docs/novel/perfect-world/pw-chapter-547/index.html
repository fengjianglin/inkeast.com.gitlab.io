He began to add more force, sending slaps carrying tremendous power down on his face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The underworld youth’s lips swelled and turned into a dark purple. Bruises covered his face that had been slapped to a deformed state. All of his teeth had been sent flying together with strings of blood.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was absolutely furious. When had he been beaten up like this before?” This wasn’t just a pain of the flesh, but instead a suffering of the spirit. It made him feel incomparably sullen and humiliated. With his background, how could he have ended up in this type of state?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You… better stop!” He roared. His eyes were full of bitter resentment and flames of anger.&nbsp;</span></p>

Even the bridge of his nose caved in from the beating. His mouth was crooked and his eyes were slanted; his face was completely ruined.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The underworld youth descended with even a divine servant to protect him, yet he ended up suffering this type of humiliation. He was so angry he was about to go unconscious.&nbsp;</span></p>

These words came from his throat, sounding like the roars of a wild beast.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew that it was useless to even ask for forgiveness. After falling into the hands of this ‘murderer’, he was doomed to have a layer of skin shed. It was possible that he wouldn’t get out of this alive.&nbsp;</span></p>

Do you really believe yourself to be infallible? Do you think that you’ve cultivated the zhang six golden body and your thing is three foot thick? Are you not afraid of getting beaten?” Shi Hao spoke while slapping down.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pi pa</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;sounds continuously rained down on everyone’s ears. Everyone was stupefied as they watched. This was just too… lacking in elegancy. This was a battle between cultivators, and normally, one would always directly cut an enemy down, yet today, it reached this state.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone felt pity for the unfortunate Underworld Race cultivator.</span></p>

What was he using the zhang six golden body for? This… were they supposed to tolerate this… but it was still better to endure it, right? This was just too cruel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This beating of his mouth undoubtedly stunned everyone!“Learn some discipline. Don’t think that you can act all high and mighty just because you are from the higher realms. In reality, you are nothing. Look at your weird, not sure if you are a ghost or human looking ass. What is the difference between you and some random thing dug out of a grave? Where do you even get all your confidence from? Why do you have to look down on the lower realms so much? In my opinion, it seems like you haven’t completely evolved yet.” Shi Hao continued to thrash downwards while speaking.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right now, even the underworld youth’s eyes were red. Only, the pupils were purple, making him look extremely sinister. His anger had reached the peak.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Underworld Race, through yin and yang, comprehended the changes between life and death. They possessed a powerful innate superiority that made their cultivation speed fast and their comprehension deep. They were a powerful race in the higher realms.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, right now, the Underworld Race was being looked down upon like this and treated worse than a zombie. This truly injured his pride.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You… are crying?” Shi Hao was astonished.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the underworld youth heard this, his rage ignited. There truly were tears, but it wasn’t because he was crying, but because his lacrimal glands had ruptured, causing his tears to flow on their own. However, what it looked like to others was that… he was crying.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone revealed strange expressions and looked in this direction.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, the underworld youth truly wanted to cry. He was treated too unjustly. This was just too much of an embarrassment. He tightened his fists and truly wanted to smash them down on the person in front of him. However, his current state was incomparably terrible, to the extent where even his eyes were muddled. He simply didn’t have the strength to fight back.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span id="footnote-ref-a0ed"><span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are an underworld person, and can also be called a ghost, yet you like crying so much. You really are a crybaby</span></span><a href="#footnote-a0ed">[1]</a><span>.” Shi Hao muttered.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What kind of atrocious name was that? The underworld youth wanted to eat him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao’s final slap descended, breaking his underworld bone and he tossed him onto the ground, because he felt that there wasn’t much time left. If he continued to stall for time, the other two would recover.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He looked towards another individual and said, “Even though you don’t have any kind intentions towards me, you didn’t say as much and weren’t as annoying, so just stay off to the side for now.” Shi Hao trampled down on the Immortal Mountain youth, fracturing a portion of his bones and eliminating his fighting strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then, he picked up the black clad woman and revealed a smile that exposed his snow white teeth. “You kept on saying again and again how you wanted to borrow the bone in my body to take a look and acted like everything you said was how it should be. I really don’t know where you get such confidence from. Was it all from that fake deity that just had its divine flame ignited?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without a doubt, with the little Stone’s nature, he would never let himself be wronged, and there was even less of a chance of him holding back his grievance. Only after he lashed out with both his left and right hand did he release a breath of satisfaction.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The black clad female from the Demonic Sunflower Garden was shaking, because she was still in her elderly state and couldn’t move her arms and legs properly. She was so angry she coughed out blood and screamed angrily.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was extremely humiliated, and she felt even more fear. She was a wonderful young lady, but she was now in an aged state. All of the skin on her body was wrinkled, and she was in a senile state. For a woman, this was even more unbearable than death.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She truly feared that she would forever be frozen in this state, because that would be an absolute nightmare. Then, she suffered another beating in front of everyone’s faces. Being dealt with like this naturally made her even more angry.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Acting all arrogant and bossy while pretending you are high above everyone else, do you think you are some green onion or something?” Shi Hao ridiculed and gave her a slap again before continuing, “You skin really is thick, even my hand is turning numb. No wonder you dare to say all those things.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that moment, the reincarnation form scattered and the time limit had arrived. The underworld youth and Immortal Mountain youth had their bones shattered and could not retaliate. They continued to remain trampled under him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, the black glad girl in Shi Hao’s hands quickly grew younger and recovered her divine force. Her wrinkled body began to sparkle and become more powerful in a flash. Her dark hair scattered about, and her eyes were like large black suns as they released astonishing dark light.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An ear-piercing scream sounded from her mouth. Her head of black hair shot upwards and pierced towards Shi Hao’s head! In addition, roots began to emerge from her body that wrapped themselves around Shi Hao’s flesh to absorb his flesh’s essence.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She came from the Demonic Sunflower Garden, so she was an existence that was formed from a sunflower. Right now, she received her innate skills.&nbsp;</span></p>

Blazing radiance emerged on the surface of Shi Hao’s skin. Symbols flickered about one after another around him, as if he had put on a set of stellar battle clothes. They were splendid and divine.&nbsp;</span></p>
