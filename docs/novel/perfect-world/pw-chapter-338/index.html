 <p><strong>Chapter 338 - Dual-Pupil's Invitation</strong></p>
 <p>Shi Hao’s thoughts were complicated. After being informed that the dual-pupiled individual had returned, he immediately thought of many things. His fate was changed so drastically because of that mother and son duo.</p>
 <p>So many years had already passed, so it wasn’t difficult for Shi Hao to face him calmly without any wild display of anger. However, there was still a wave of fiery heat rising within his heart.</p>
 <p>“My good little brother, I have returned. Where are you?”</p>
 <p>When Huo Ling’er repeated these words, Shi Hao appeared to be in deep thought. He could feel the opposing party’s self-confidence, as well as a sense of indifference.</p>
 <p>Of course, this was an attitude of contempt. Shi Yi was inviting him to fight it out!</p>
 <p>The matter of seizing the supreme being bone was naturally already in the past. Shi Yi had never felt any feelings of guilt, and from his tone of voice, it was clear that he was extremely confident.</p>
 <p>Shi Hao was completely silent as he gazed into the fiery domain. His face seemed extremely calm, but there were flames jumping within his pupils.</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong? What are you thinking about?” Huo Ling’er asked softly.</p>
 <p>In the distance, the young lady with large eyes and those other youngsters’ eyes were all focused. Just now, they had already discovered Shi Hao’s identity. This fellow was that… savage devilish child?! It really was someone they had wanted to take a look at! These fellows have almost rubbed their ears swollen and never expected to have ended up encountering him.</p>
 <p>In reality, Shi Hao didn’t mind his appearance that much, so his hair was rather disheveled. His expression also had some changes, so it was likely that not even acquaintances would recognize him. Huo Ling’er could only find him based on his unyielding aura by looking for traces of his oppressive behavior. Otherwise, it truly would have been hard for her to find him.</p>
 <p>The large-eyed young lady and those youngsters thoughts were wildly jumping about. This fellow whose name shook the world was one of the few individuals who descendants of lords like them looked up to, yet they met each other just like that.</p>
 <p>“I’m thinking of how to beat the crap out of him.” Shi Hao said softly. Having a life or death struggle would be too tiresome, and only by giving him a great beating as soon as they meet would some of the fury within him diminish.</p>
 <p>As for the grudge between them, it could be settled during the true decisive battle.</p>
 <p>Needless to say, once a great battle of life and death broke out, it would be incomparably difficult. Blood and bone would splatter out at every corner because Shi Yi was just too powerful.</p>
 <p>Huo Ling’er’s smile was extremely enchanting. She was just a like a blossoming scarlet lotus within this fiery land. She was slender and elegant, drawing out an extremely bright and beautiful figure. Her smile alone could move many people down to their soul.</p>
 <p>“There is no need to carry out the fight now. You are still three or four years younger than him, so if you fight now, you’ll suffer greatly. Postpone it for a later date.” She advised in this manner.</p>
 <p>Shi Hao turned around and gave her a look, not expressing any approval. He gently sighed and then looked towards the horizon again.</p>
 <p>“When you issued the challenge, you had to wait for a long time without any sign of his return. Similarly, now that he returned, you should similarly give him the cold shoulder.” &nbsp;Huo Ling’er advised with a somewhat cunning smile.</p>
 <p>When Shi Hao heard what was said, the corners of his mouth revealed a hint of a smile, and his attitude seemed to have changed. Finally, he nodded and said, “Right, I’ll leave him hanging for a period of time first.”</p>
 <p>This confrontation was unavoidable, and a great storm was inevitably going to break out. However, this battle was not only about Shi Yi. Were they going to fight as soon as he appeared just because he wanted to? Of course not.</p>
 <p>If Huo Ling’er had her way, then she would’ve left the dual-pupiled individual in the dirt forever, making him worry endlessly. Meanwhile, Shi Hao could calmly focus on cultivating and improving his strength.</p>
 <p>Shi Hao muttered to himself, “The battle isn’t too far away.”</p>
 <p>When Huo Ling’er heard this, she sighed. She knew that this fellow had his own thoughts and would not listen to the advice of others.</p>
 <p>“Do you have any particular plans for the days to come?” Huo Ling’er asked.</p>
 <p>“Cultivation, and then an honest and proper battle!” Shi Hao replied.</p>
 <p>“This doesn’t seem like your style… I’ve always thought of you as someone who would scheme and set a trap for the dual-pupiled individual,” said Huo Ling’er.</p>
 <p>“Nonsense, am I that kind of person? Heaven warping martial god, just and honorable. These are the words that describe my style,” Shi Hao retorted.</p>
 <p>This time, he truly only wanted to fight it out in an honest manner. He needed a great battle where he could fight to his heart’s content. He wanted to show the world that he could still reach greatness even without a supreme being bone.</p>
 <p>“Then from here on out, you need to cultivate bitterly.” Huo Ling’er reminded.</p>
 <p>“I’ll treat you to some food later.” Shi Hao seemed to be extremely enthusiastic upon bringing up this topic.</p>
 <p>The Flame Python was one of the archaic era’s overlords. It was known as the Demonic Flame God and was extraordinarily ferocious. Shi Hao chopped off a chunk of the scarlet python flesh and threw it into the Heaven Transforming Bowl to slowly cook it. It truly was an absolutely shocking sight.</p>
 <p>This was a young expert from outside of this region with extraordinary strength. It was incredibly strong and difficult to fight against. A pure-blooded creature with such an illustrious reputation was killed by this fellow in the end just like that.</p>
 <p>“I’ve now decided that any enemy of yours that isn’t a humanoid creature will definitely suffer tragically. Upon defeat, they will inevitably be eaten.” Huo Ling’er said while laughing. She was just a like a blossoming scarlet lotus, with a gaze that was intoxicating.</p>
 <p>“So fragrant!” The mouth of the young lady with large eyes was flowing with grease. She no longer cared about her image and began to fight over the food with Huo Ling’er.</p>
 <p>From the side, those individuals felt as if everything wasn’t truly happening as they ate the Flame Python meat. This genius from beyond this region was displaying his vicious might and making others feel reverence not long ago, yet it was now part of their meal? It felt like they were dreaming. Their respect and feelings toward Shi Hao continuously battered within them like great waves. This was just too savage!</p>
 <p>“You really are the… youngster that swept through all the great sects within the Void God Realm? It really feels like I’m dreaming.” One of the youngsters spoke in a dizzy manner.</p>
 <p>“Have some python meat.” Shi Hao tore off a piece and revealed a large smile.</p>
 <p>“It really is a bit hard to believe. Is there something that we could help with?” One of them asked.</p>
 <p>“In a bit, help me find a magma lake. I need to catch some Yang Fish,” said Shi Hao. This was currently the most pressing matter, as well as what he looked forward to the most. He needed to continue increasing his strength.</p>
 <p>After all was said and done, he was still a few years behind in cultivation. He lacked the experience he could have gained during that time, and so he was under quite a bit of pressure. However, it was possible that this place might make up for some of his deficiencies.</p>
 <p>Following that, Huo Ling’er separated from them. She left him and the youngsters to go find Yang Fish, because no matter where she went, she would draw in the attention of others. If they continued to roam about together, rumors would definitely begin to emerge.</p>
 <p>From that day forth, Shi Hao began to bitterly cultivate.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Stone Country, imperial capital.</p>
 <p>More than half a month had passed, yet there was no sign of Shi Hao. Everyone became a bit worried, as they all wanted to witness the clash between these two supreme youths.</p>
 <p>Shi Yi kept his composure. More than half a month had passed while waiting just like that.</p>
 <p>“My good little brother, where are you? Now that I have arrived, do you dare show yourself?” He once again spoke in a calm manner. A great ripple was stirred by these words.</p>
 <p>Shi Yi took the initiative to issue a challenge, drawing attention from all sides. All of the great powers were watching closely.</p>
 <p>He currently overlooked the Martial Imperial Manor. Each day, if he wasn’t chanting sutras, then he was strolling about. He did not go out of his way to cultivate. There was an otherworldly and outstanding style to him, making even the older generations apprehensive.</p>
 <p>There were some who could tell that his strength had advanced by leaps and bounds, becoming extremely powerful. At this moment, he was reciting a scripture that allowed himself to return to a natural state. This was a type of stabilization following a great advancement.</p>
 <p>A month had gone by, and Shi Hao still had not appeared. In the end, Shi Yi left and entered the Void God Realm. He quaked the path that he walked, burning the air around him.</p>
 <p>A month had passed, but Shi Hao still hadn’t made an appearance. In the end, Shi Yi got up and left for the Void God Realm. Wherever he went, a huge commotion would be raised. The entire place was in an uproar as a result.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Fire Nation, ancestral ground.</p>
 <p>During the past month, Shi Hao was always busy cultivating. &nbsp;This fiery domain was truly like a land of full of treasure that was waiting to be dug up.</p>
 <p>It was to a point where Shi Hao wanted to completely dig up this ancestral ground and find out exactly what there was at its core. Why did this place possess substances with such abundant divinity?</p>
 <p>Only, after several attempts, only magma could be seen wherever he dug. He swam down and almost tired himself to death without seeing any real end.</p>
 <p>In the end, he tossed these matters aside. He was going to cultivate and obtain the things he needed first.</p>
 <p>This time, Shi Hao killed a total of five powerful creatures, all of which were close to the noble king level. Their bone marrow were dried and collected; he was going for a large harvest this time.</p>
 <p>In addition, he even grinded some of the pure-blooded Flame Python’s flesh and mixed it within as fragrant bait.</p>
 <p>The girl with large eyes and her party led him to a boiling lake. This lake of lava was enormous, occupying an extremely vast area. The scarlet multicolored radiance was extremely beautiful. They all felt like they were being cooked alive even from far away.</p>
 <p>“This is a demonic lake. Some strange things have happened in the past, and quite a few people died.”</p>
 <p>These were all past events that the youngsters brought up. However, based on Shi Hao’s speculation, there was most likely some kind of powerful creature dwelling here, and from various clues, he had his suspicions that there might be a giant Yang Fish.</p>
 <p>In other words, there might be a profound dao path involved. The extremely terrifying Yang Fish possessed incredible powers and could easily behead the strong.</p>
 <p>Shi Hao’s preparations were sufficient. He scattered the dried bone marrow into the lake and patiently waited. These types of Yang Fish were extremely cunning. If they were alarmed, they definitely wouldn’t fall for the same trick again.</p>
 <p>After four entire hours passed, when even Shi Hao was about to give up, the surface of the lake began to ripple. With a <i>pa</i> sound, an arc of lightning hacked apart the magma. A large portion of the sparkling bone marrow was sent into the air. A golden Yang Fish soared up and devoured it all.</p>
 <p>“So big!”</p>
 <p>The girl with large eyes cried out in alarm. This Yang Fish was at a foot in length, larger than anything they had hunted in the past. This was still not what was strange. A group followed behind it, and they were all roughly a foot in size. Golden light shone resplendently.</p>
 <p>“One, two…”</p>
 <p>There were at least a hundred. This entire place was extremely beautiful as golden light shone brilliantly. The school of beautiful Yang Fish swam within the lava, creating a miraculous sight.</p>
 <p>Just how many times more precious were these than the finger length Yang Fish? They all possessed abilities that weren’t weak, and who knew just how many times more powerful their divine efficacies would be. They were definitely world-shocking precious medicines.</p>
 <p>This time, Shi Hao’s preparations were ample, and he had long sealed up the lake shore. The Eight Vicious Swords formation appeared, and there were also all types of precious artifacts that emerged to block the shore in fear of anyone disturbing them.</p>
 <p>When the school of fish drew near, he quickly brought out the Heaven Transforming Bowl and even threw himself forward to collect these foot long Yang Fish.</p>
 <p>This was a great battlefield. These Yang Fish were fearless, and they even began to attack him. All of them radiated with light, releasing strand after strand of symbols to form an expanse of golden lightning. <i>Pipa</i> sounds continuously rang out.</p>
 <p>Shi Hao also knew how to control electricity. He summoned the Suan Ni precious technique.</p>
 <p><i>Hong!</i></p>
 <p>In the end, a streak of golden flames soared, giving him a great shock. This was True Solar Flame, and it was extremely terrifying. Even though it wasn’t completely pure, it was still enough to make an Engravement Realm expert tremble.</p>
 <p>Shi Hao’s eyes narrowed and he merged with the Imperishable Golden Body. Now was not the time to hesitate, because he had to do his utmost to subdue these fish.</p>
 <p>Sure enough, these Yang Fishes’ spiritual awarenesses were extremely keen. As soon as they sensed danger, they wanted to scatter and flee to prevent being caught. However, it was still too late. Shi Hao released his ten heavenly passages and threw himself into the lava to lock down this place. He immediately confined this entire area.</p>
 <p>In the end, not a single one of the hundred plus Yang Fish were able to break free. They were all captured alive, making the youngsters on shore cry out happily. This was truly too shocking.</p>
 <p>“Over a hundred foot-length Yang Fish! Truly a rare sight!”</p>
 <p>In addition, what shocked Shi Hao the most was that there were three that were half a metre in length. If he didn’t open his ten heavenly passages, with the remarkable power and profound abilities these three possessed, he most likely would not have been able to catch them.</p>
 <p>Eventually, he refined all hundred of the Yang Fish into a small bowl of golden liquid. The divine power fluctuated violently, with the force of natural laws and symbols interweaving within.</p>
 <p>Shi Hao went into isolation and used the divine substance to comprehend the dao.</p>
 <p>Half a month later, a violent fluctuation was released, causing the young lady with large eyes and the others to be astonished. They knew that this savage fellow had broken through.</p>
 <p>Shi Hao had broken into the mid-stage of the Engravement Realm. His cultivation speed was enough to make others dumbstruck. If news of this got out, everyone’s jaws might drop straight to the ground.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, at this time, Huo Ling’er received a report and found this place. Moreover, she gave Shi Hao some information. Shi Yi had spent his time recently in the Void God Realm.</p>
 <p>“What is he doing?” Shi Hao asked.</p>
 <p>“Chanting sutras, walking around. He has been researching the records set by those of the past,” Huo Ling’er replied.</p>
 <p>When Shi Hao heard what she said, he couldn’t help but furrow his brows. “Formidable!”</p>
 <p>It was obvious that the reason Shi Yi was chanting sutras was because he had reached an extremely high cultivation realm. He was cleansing his heart and spirit, as well as polishing his flesh. It was an incredibly mysterious and miraculous realm.</p>
 <p>“What are your plans?” Huo Ling’er asked.</p>
 <p>“I’m obviously going to pay the Void God Realm a visit,” Shi Hao replied.</p>
