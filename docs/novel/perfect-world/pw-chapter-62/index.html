 <p><strong>Chapter 6</strong><strong>2 – The Little Guy</strong></p>
 <p>“Nothing will go wrong as long as the four ancestral elders are here. I believe they’ve purposely allowed a hundred of little Yi’s bones break earlier because they were allowing Shi Ziling to vent out a bit of his anger.” Another clan elder calm and collectedly said.</p>
 <p>Shi Ziling held his battle spear and flew forth like a demonic god. After a long whistle, a huge Archaic Vicious beast emerged from within his body and followed him in his killing path.</p>
 <p><em>Xiu!</em></p>
 <p>Shi Yi raised head. His eyes were deep and profound as if the sun and the moon rotated within them, and a river of stars fell in between; extremely terrifying. Soon afterwards, he released two beams of magnificent light forged out of symbols. The symbols were densely packed, and they violently shot into the sky.</p>
 <p>Once again, he sent the heaven and earth into chaos to interfere with Shi Ziling’s technique, however this time, it was useless. With a sweep of his golden battle spear, the heaven and earth began to rumble. Ten thousand golden waves surged forth and crushed each and every corner.</p>
 <p>With a&nbsp;<em>pu</em>&nbsp;sound<em>,&nbsp;</em>several clan elders began to spit out blood as they were swept away. After Shi Li landed, he began to stagger, spitting out blood with every step. He almost allowed Shi Yi to fly away as his body shuddered from nearly falling over.</p>
 <p><em>Hou…&nbsp;</em>By Shi Ziling’s side, that Archaic Vicious Beast was also displaying its earth-shaking might. Its demonic aura was like the sea as it began to spread into every direction.</p>
 <p>The four clan elders were shaken once again, and they spat out blood.</p>
 <p>“Keep fighting!”</p>
 <p>The four rushed forward and attacked together.</p>
 <p>These several individuals were engaged in an intense battle. Their precious technique rushed into the heavens and shook every direction. Intense rays of light flourished as Shi Ziling had the appearance of a golden war god. Under the combined attack of the four experts, he was unexpectedly able to gain the upper hand!</p>
 <p>The great battle reached its climax, and the four clan elders’ clothes were all dyed with blood. However, as the battle went on, Shi Ziling became even more valiant. His divine splendor overflowed into the heavens as it oppressed and suffocated those people.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a terrifying wave of fluctuation began to emit from Shi Li’s body as if an Archaic Divine Monarch was appearing. It shook the vast heavens and the earth, and his chest was emitting light.</p>
 <p>“Huh?” Shi Ziling was shocked.</p>
 <p>This was too sudden. This terrifying strength was able to oppress everything. It even surprisingly stopped the golden battle spear and obliterated that Archaic Vicious Beast by Shi Ziling’s side.</p>
 <p>The divine light within Shi Ziling’s eyes began to increase dramatically. By shooting out two golden rays of lightning from within his eyes, he was able to scatter that terrifying fluctuation. The battle spear within his hands once again lit up with light, and a large cluster of symbols rotated about is as it exerted its intimidation in every direction.</p>
 <p><em>Hong!</em></p>
 <p>The golden battle spear pierced forward as if it were penetrating the heaven and earth. The chants of deities began to sound as the incredibly divine and genuine radiance sprinkled everywhere. He was using an attack to defend himself!</p>
 <p>Shi Li’s attack was truly terrifying, and it was almost as if he was one with Shi Yi. His chest began to emit light, and complicated net-like patterns covered his body as it circulated various heavenly mysteries.</p>
 <p>That aura was too terrifying. It shook the other three clan elders until they all spat out blood and began to retreat. It overwhelmed all of them, because even though this attack wasn’t directed at them, they still felt such a strong backlash.</p>
 <p>In the distance, all the spectators felt like they were struck by a hammer. All of their bodies began to tremble, and they couldn’t help but stagger backwards. The people who were a bit closer had blood coming out of the corner of their mouths and their breathing practically stopped. They couldn’t help but feel the need to kneel and bow.</p>
 <p>“It’s little Hao’s Supreme Being Bone!” Shi Ziling’s gaze suddenly turned as cold as possible as his anger reached its peak.</p>
 <p>Shi Li carried Shi Yi on his back. The two of them together forcefully operated that bone to utilize its divine might, shaking everyone in every direction with no exceptions.</p>
 <p>However, with just this one attack. Shi Li’s spirit essence was completely empty. He couldn’t bear it any longer and began to continuously cough out blood. His body began to swing to and fro as cracks began to appear throughout.</p>
 <p>As for Shi Yi who was on his back, his chest began to emit&nbsp;<em>kacha&nbsp;</em>sounds. The bones which returned back into place began to jolt out again. He suffered serious damage from the backlash since the Supreme Being Bone wasn’t completely matured yet and shouldn’t be used like this.</p>
 <p>Shi Ziling was vigorously blazed all over with golden light. He stood over the entire sky and was so powerful that it made people shudder. He was actually unaffected by the precious bone’s attack as he continued to force his way forward.</p>
 <p><em>Dong!</em></p>
 <p>With each step, the heavens and the earth trembled. He was like a death god who broke out from his fetters, bringing about an aura of misfortune. His entire body emitted bone-splitting killing intent as his spear swept forward.</p>
 <p>The three clan elders were sent flying. Their bodies were bloody all over as they fell in between a group of people. They were unable to crawl back up again as many of their bones were broken, and they had difficulty using their symbols.</p>
 <p>As for Shi Li, he had to face Shi Ziling’s most powerful attack. The spear tip began to radiate and fly into the sky like a golden Flood Dragon. It penetrated through his protective precious technique and spilt a great deal of his fresh blood.</p>
 <p><em>Pu,&nbsp;</em>a small chunk of his body exploded. The sharp pain caused him to tremble, and his symbols were immediately obliterated. They were completely ineffective, and fear was written all of his face.</p>
 <p>Like an ancient god king, Shi Ziling was bathed in radiance all over. He took a step forward and pointed his golden battle spear forward with the intention of piercing both Shi Li and Shi Yi and impaling them into the ground.</p>
 <p>“Ziling, you should restrain yourself now.” Precisely at this moment, the ancestral elder on the east suddenly made his move. He was still sitting just a moment ago, but he arrived in front of them like a streak of lightning. His entire body emitted a mist, and his figure was indistinct. He stretched a hand forward to block that terrifying spear tip in order to protect those two people.</p>
 <p>In actuality, they were always here. From the moment Shi Ziling stepped into the mansion, they made their move and sealed this entire region.</p>
 <p>At the earliest moment when Shi Ziling stepped into the clan, he felt a weird atmosphere. He sensed the aura of the four ancestral elders and immediately had a terrible premonition.</p>
 <p>The four had extremely deep cultivation, and it was difficult to sense just how deep it was. As long as they were here, it was far too difficult to rely on force to achieve justice. It was absolutely unknown just how long they had cultivated for.</p>
 <p>“Ancestors, is this how you administer justice?” Shi Ziling shouted.</p>
 <p>“I know that you feel wronged. The entire clan feels sorry towards little Hao, but please believe us when we say that we will certainly make it up to you.” the ancestral elders said.</p>
 <p>At this precise moment, mist began to fill the air and the other three ancestral elders also appeared, trapping him in the middle while remaining silent.</p>
 <p>“I refuse!” Shi Ziling roared loudly. His entire body began to emit light and the golden spear within his hand tilted toward the south sky. Symbols surged forth as he activated his supreme precious technique to initiate a battle once again.</p>
 <p>No one could contain their emotions. He dared to fight with the ancestral elders. This was the first time in clan history where someone dared to act like this! Shi Ziling’s power shocked everyone!</p>
 <p>“Ziling, you’re being too excessive. If you insist on fighting, then don’t blame us for putting you down!” An ancestral elder said.</p>
 <p>“Then let’s fight!” Shi Ziling waved his battle spear again as his entire body brightened. Symbols began to interweave and an Archaic Vicious Beast rushed forth. This world-shaking precious technique was his most powerful attack.</p>
 <p>The day seemed to have been torn apart as the dazzling holy light obscured the entire area. No one could face it head on, and everyone was trembling without exception. They felt the need to kneel in face of this divine power.</p>
 <p>“Suppress him!” The ancestral elders took action.</p>
 <p>The most terrifying battle was currently happening at this place. It shook the heavens and the earth, shaking everyone to the core. Everyone’s soul was shivering uncontrollably as they felt waves of fear.</p>
 <p>“I can’t see…” In front of the Stone Village’s big willow tree, the little guy’s face was full of tears, and he couldn’t see that battle.</p>
 <p>“Since you were too young, you couldn’t see those series of fights.” The willow tree’s voice sounded. Chaotic air began to fill the atmosphere and this place was still in a state of indistinct haziness.</p>
 <p>“I want to keep looking. I need to know the results.” The little guy tightly clenched his fists. Although he knew these things happened a long time ago, he was still feeling nervous.</p>
 <p>The stone mansion was filled with a dazzling splendor. All kinds of holy light flew about while it overshadowing the daylight. It covered the entire mansion, and it was absolutely impossible to see anything else.</p>
 <p>“Two hearts beat as one!” Finally, the little guy’s mother entered the battle as well. She held him as she entered the battlefield to cooperate with Shi Ziling, and they were going to activate a precious technique that could shake the entire empire.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, the little guy couldn’t see anything. The only thing that entered his eyes was the light caused by the precious technique. It was gorgeous to the point of making people’s hearts shudder. The entire world was dyed in a faint gold by this divine and holy light.</p>
 <p>Finally, he passed out in his mother’s bosoms because he was too weak. Right before he shut his large eyes, he saw his young older brother on the outskirts of the battle.</p>
 <p>Although Shi Yi had many of his bones broken, his spiritual essence did not weaken. His dual pupils were still deep and profound as he stared at Shi Ziling with a chilly look. Then he turned to look at the little guy and a smirk was formed at his mouth. His eyes contained a glittering radiance that shunned the entire world. After looking at the little guy for only a moment, he lost interest.</p>
 <p>Since the little guy was at his last breath and lost his Supreme Being Bone, his life was basically lost and was unworthy of his interest.</p>
 <p>For a long time after that, the little guy was in a dizzy state. He lingered around on the brink of life and death, and was became incredibly weak. His life force seemed like it could dry up at any moment and he didn’t know what was happening in front of him at all.</p>
 <p>Once he woke up again, he had already arrived in a wild and desolate land that was far away from the vast ancient country. They had left the bustling empire to a place that held a world of difference.</p>
 <p>They arrived at a large shabby manor. This was the recovery place for the ancestors of the Stone Family, and could be considered as a second ancestral land.</p>
 <p>“Ziling, you’re truly exceptional!” An elder with white hair and bear patted his old desk in excitement. He was also furious and said, “If I was fifty years younger and had your power, I would wreak havoc within the empire as well. They dare to bully the people of our family?!”</p>
 <p>Shi Ziling shook head and his face was somewhat pale.</p>
 <p>An elderly old man opened his mouth and said, “To go as far as sending you to this bitter land, they are truly excessive. You’re still so young!”</p>
 <p>“That’s right. They call this their second ancestral land, but what is it really? It’s cold and barren. This place isn’t a happy paradise at all, and it absolutely isn’t suitable for long term cultivation.</p>
 <p>This shabby second ancestral land was located on the outskirts of the desolate lands. Only those who committed huge blunders or provoked some huge disaster would be exiled to this place.</p>
 <p>“This was the agreement I had with them. Little Hao is to be raised here.” Shi Ziling said.</p>
 <p>“Isn’t that the same thing? You’re being exiled to this place!” An elder angrily said, and then asked in confusion, “What did they give you after all was said and done?”</p>
 <p>“If little Hao could recover his exuberant life force, they would return his Supreme Being Bone right away.” Shi Ziling said.</p>
 <p>“Child, how can you believe such things? This is just their way of stalling. With little Hao’s injuries like this, even if he could live on, he absolutely wouldn’t be able to nourish a Supreme Being Bone!” The elder beat his chest and stamped his feet.</p>
 <p>Apart from the servants here, there were four special elders. They were all characters who were once famed for their outstanding performance and had extremely high positions in the family. The only thing was that they committed some huge mistakes in the past, and were exiled to this wild and desolate land.</p>
 <p>If not for the fact that they didn’t want to make their heirs’ lives complicated, they would have escaped a long time ago since their cultivation levels were extremely frightening. Many years passed by in a flash, and those people were already in their declining years without much time left.</p>
 <p>“The four elders gave me a ruined drawing behind everyone’s back and told me if I could find the real ancestral land of our clan, then perhaps little Hao could recover there.” said Shi Ziling lightly.</p>
 <p>A look of concern lingered over his wife who stood at the side while holding the weak little guy. A smile hadn’t appear on her beautiful face for a long time.</p>
 <p>“What, our clan’s real ancestral land?” Several elders all widened their eyes since that wasn’t an ordinary place. There were many mysteries and legends that talked about the first ancestors of the Stone Clan originating from that place. They founded the endless glory and established the ancient country.</p>
 <p>Those people were all excited. That ancestral land was attached to the hearts of many people within the Stone Clan. It held many mysteries, and there were rumors of that place being able to give birth to saints! However, their ancestors severed connections with that place, and it became impossible to find.</p>
 <p>“Is that real or fake, they’re not lying to you right?” One of the elders wasn’t very convinced.</p>
 <p>“No matter what, I have to give it a try and use my greatest effort to restore Hao’er!” Shi Ziling’s face was unwavering and determined.</p>
 <p>“What if you can’t find it?” An elder mentioned.</p>
 <p>“Then I’ll look for an ancient sacred mountain within the vast reaches of the wasteland and find a divine medicine. I absolutely won’t allow Hao’er to fall into oblivion like this!” Shi Ziling said.</p>
 <p>His wife who stood by his side nodded. Her beautiful eyes was brimming with determination as she held the little guy.</p>
 <p>The elders immediately jumped in fear. They all opened their mouths and solemnly warned.</p>
 <p>“Ziling, don’t just randomly do things. An ancient sacred mountain isn’t a place you can just randomly walk into. There might be a Genuine Hou, Golden Winged Peng and those types of creatures living there. You’d be throwing your life away!”</p>
 <p>Shi Ziling was always researching that diagram. If it wasn’t his last resort, he naturally wouldn’t step into an ancient sacred mountain. He still hoped that he could find the ancestral land.</p>
 <p>“If Hao’er died, then my life and death struggle with them will be imminent. I will kill until their world is turned upside down!” Shi Ziling’s gaze was terrifying as he exposed his frightening aura.</p>
 <p>“According to the promise, Hao’er should remain here in order to recover. They acted like this because they don’t feel at ease around you. This is their way of putting you under control, and they fear that you might go back and start killing everything” said an elder.</p>
 <p>“I won’t allow Hao’er to stay here!” Shi Ziling naturally wasn’t that type of inflexible person.</p>
 <p>“Let’s do this, let’s not give them any excuses. If we can’t be certain whether or not you can cure Hao’er, then we’ll find a child as a substitute. In the future, we must get back that Supreme Being Bone!”</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>Afterwards, Shi Ziling and his wife experienced countless trials and tribulations in order to find Stone Village. When they saw the scorched black willow tree, they were truly shocked. They were very powerful, so they naturally found out that this tree was extraordinary.</p>
 <p>However, they were disappointed at everything else in Stone Village.</p>
 <p>A gust of wind blew by and dispersed the mist. Under the willow tree, the little guy stood in isolation with tears all over his face.</p>
 <p>After a long while, the willow tree finally asked him, “How do you feel?”</p>
 <p>“My heart aches so much. Father, mother, where are you right now?” The little guy continuously wept.</p>
 <p>“You really are a kindhearted child, you aren’t aroused by the hatred, and you haven’t lost your reasoning to seek revenge.” The willow tree transmitted its voice through, and then it said once again, “You lost the Supreme&nbsp;Being Bone, don’t you hate it? The brilliance of Shi Yi will certainly be world-shaking. He would be enveloped in endless divine glory, and an ordinary person could never hope to look up to him.</p>
 <p>The little guy naturally knew that Shi Yi’s destiny was bound to surpass ordinary people, and &nbsp;he could picture Shi Yi’s glory transcending the earth.</p>
 <p>He calmed replied, “Isn’t it just a bone? Supreme Being isn’t a title that can be bestowed, it’s not something that a piece bone can decide. It’s something that you create yourself by taking one step at a time.”</p>
 <p>“Since you are able to speak such words, then I’ll tell you a secret.” &nbsp;The willow tree was very happy and reassuring.</p>
 <p>“What secret?” The little guy was astonished.</p>
 <p>“Have you ever seen wilted grass and dried wood prosper again?” asked the willow tree.</p>
