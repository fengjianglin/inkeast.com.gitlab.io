 <p><strong>Chapter 8 - The Green Scaled Eagle</strong></p>
 <p><span>The dark skinned Er Meng was giggling foolishly to the point where his saliva almost dripped out of his mouth. He quickly walked forward and said, “This is the biggest nest I’ve ever looted from! This is the first time I’ve seen eggs as large as these.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Hehe, that’s right. It’s only when I steal from this kind of nest that I feel a sense of accomplishment.” Pi Hou insipidly laughed like a mountain monkey.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Truly beautiful!” The little Shi Hao’s eyelashes fluttered as his large eyes blinked. He watched the three warm bird eggs that were full of luster glisten like crystals. He could not help but rejoice. Being the youngest, he was extremely curious and wanted to hold the eggs to examine them closely.</span></p>
 <p><span>Ermeng walked up, but right when he reached out his hand to touch the giant egg, he let out an </span><i><span>aiyou </span></i><span>sound. He felt like his arm had gone numb, as if it had been shocked by electricity.</span></p>
 <p><span>“What is going on?!” The children were alarmed.</span></p>
 <p><span>On the jade-like egg shell, spots and markings shone beautifully like stars glowing in the sky. A mysterious power was flowing around it.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Truly powerful. The Green Scaled Eagle is the descendant of an archaic demonic bird, and although its bloodline has long become impure, there are still some damaged symbols that have been passed down within its life imprint.” As someone who studied the bone text, he was able to draw some clues from this. He spoke this in a clear voice as if he was a small adult.</span></p>
 <p><span>The children were all shocked and excited. The creature who gave birth to these eggs was rare and powerful, so the hatchlings would definitely inherit its rare and precious bloodline. In the future, they could protect the village and might even be comparable to guardian spirits.</span></p>
 <p><span>“The radiance only flows around the spots. Be careful not to touch them in those areas and put them into the beast skin pouch. We need to leave as soon as possible.” Shi Dazhuang was tall and well built. He urged the others to hurry up, as now was not the time to be idling about.</span></p>
 <p><span>Of course, they came prepared. Each person had a beast skin pouch, and after quickly opening them up, the vicious bird eggs were carefully placed inside. There were a total of three water basin sized jasper eggs. Other than the little guy, the three individuals each carried a pouch.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Awesome! We actually succeeded!” Er Meng was extremely happy, and he laughed until a snot almost came out from his nose.</span></p>
 <p><span>Pi Hou was also giggling happily. “In the future, our Stone Village will have powerful vicious birds protecting it. The chief, uncle Linghu, and the others will definitely see us under a different light.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“</span><i><span>Aiyou</span></i><span>!” Shi Dazhuang slipped and almost fell. However, he was caught by the little guy.</span></p>
 <p><span>The vicious bird’s nest was covered in golden silk grass, making it extremely soft. However, in the center, there were a few scales that gave off flashes of chilly metallic luster. Shi Dazhuang wasn’t paying attention to the ground and stepped on one. It pierced through his shoe, causing some blood to drip out from the sole of his foot. Fortunately, only the skin was scratched.</span></p>
 <p><span>“These scales are so sharp!” The little Shi Hao took the green scales and collected them with his hands. They were each about the size of a baby’s hand, and they all flickered with cold light.</span></p>
 <p><span>“These are definitely the vicious bird’s scales. They really are extraordinary after all. I reckon that not even a broadsword nearing 100 jin in weight could split open these scales!” Pi Hou said.</span></p>
 <p><span>The few kids did not dare dawdle around, quickly descending along the cliff like lizards. Soon after, they reached the ground. They all wiped off their sweat, and let out deep breaths.</span></p>
 <p><span>“How was it? Did you guys obtain anything?” The group of children all gathered around.</span></p>
 <p><span>“We succeeded. We smuggled out a bunch of bird eggs. Haha…” Er Meng laughed loudly.</span></p>
 <p><span>The children opened the animal hide pouches and looked at its contents. They all gasped in admiration when they saw eggs that were as large as water basins. The eggs were were all shining brilliantly with mysterious green spots scattered over their surfaces. All of them sighed in admiration.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Awesome! We succeeded!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“These are actually the powerful vicious bird’s eggs. Our Stone Village will have flying battle birds in the future.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Let’s get out of here!”</span></p>
 <p><span>They were happy and excited as they jumped around like a group of little mountain beasts. Moving swiftly, they soon left Stone Forest and the Green Scaled Eagle’s home.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Things really went smoothly this time. Let’s leave this place quickly!”</span></p>
 <p><span>The mountain forest was dense with plant growth. Dead leaves piled up to a foot in height, making the ground quite soft when stepped on. Enormous trees stretched into the sky, blocking out out the scorching sun. Ancient vines snaked around the trees like Horned Dragons, and from the distance, the roars of beasts could be heard from time to time, shaking the mountain region.</span></p>
 <p><span>Fortunately, they weren’t too far from from Stone Village now. They were also in a relatively safe area since they didn’t approach the great mountains where vicious beasts roamed about.</span></p>
 <p><span>“We’re almost there, one more burst of energy! Let’s hurry back to the village!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Even though the group of children were excited, there was still some worry within their hearts. After all, the Green Scaled Eagle was a creature that even made the village’s strongest adults feel fear. This entire act of stealing the Green Scaled Eagle’s eggs from its nest felt like a dream.</span></p>
 <p><span>Suddenly, the cry of a bird resounded through the vast skies. It was so earsplitting that even metal and stone were cracking apart. The sound was sharp and intense as it tore at the children’s eardrums.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Oh no! The Green Scaled Eagle must have gone mad after discovering its three eggs missing!” One of the children cried out.</span></p>
 <p><span>“We need to escape quickly!” Little Shi Hao’s eyes were very bright and could see through the cracks between the huge trees. He was able to see a large shadow circle through the sky before heading in their direction.</span></p>
 <p><span>Great winds howled through the sky as an enormous bird flowing with cold cyan light cast its shadow over the mountain forest. The vicious beast swooped down with extreme speed and terrifying ferocity.</span></p>
 <p><span>By now, all the other kids were able to see the enormous bird head towards the mountain forest. Its speed was absolutely frightening, as if a star was falling from the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Oh my goodness! What a huge bird! Run for it!”</span></p>
 <p><span>The children were all crying out in alarm as fear grew within their hearts. Its body was roughly seven or eight meters in length, but when it extended its wings, it body would cover over fifteen meters. Its entire body was covered in green scales that flickered with a chilly metallic luster, and at this moment, an overwhelming fiendish aura could be felt!</span></p>
 <p><span>The group of kids scampered off in all directions, madly trying to escape by relying on their familiarity of the mountain forest. They ran specifically for areas that were relatively hidden to hide from the terrifying vicious beast in the air. </span></p>
 <p><i><span>Hong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span>Great trees that towered into the sky were smashed to pieces by its steel-like wings. Branches and leaves fluttered about chaotically, leaving fragments and debris everywhere. It was as if its body was forged from metal as it smashed apart everything hindering its descent.</span></p>
 <p><span>It was truly horrifying. The children all screamed loudly with pale faces as they ran as fast as they could.</span></p>
 <p><span>The colossus was absolutely dreadful. As its steel-like wings smashed about, everything that got caught in its path was destroyed. Chilly radiance flickered about from its metallic scales. With a single dive, a large part of the forest was destroyed, leaving only wood fragments and ruined leaves in its wake.</span></p>
 <p><span>It was just too powerful. Not only was its body incomparably solid, its wings were like wide blades that could hack apart a mountain peak. These forest trees did not stand a chance.</span></p>
 <p><span>Its form resembled that of a large eagle, but there wasn’t a single feather on its powerful body. Instead, thick scales covered it from head to toe, making it seem as if it was a creature forged from molten metal. </span></p>
 <p><span>The eagle’s curved beak was like a spear. The meter length beak gave off a black light, and traces of blood from vicious beasts could still be seen atop it. It was clear that it had just returned from a hunt. Its claws were even more intimidating, releasing a cold radiance that shone through the forest. These incomparably sharp weapons that were almost a meter in length could easily tear apart an enormous elephant.</span></p>
 <p><span>On its head were some plume feather like protrusions, but they were definitely not feathers. Instead, they were sharp bony outgrowths. Like a row of thorns, they could easily tear open a large vicious beast’s chest.</span></p>
 <p><span>This was precisely the Green Scaled Eagle, and its body was covered densely in ice cold cyan scales. Its body was full of boundless power, as if it was forged out of steel. It swept across the mountain forest, leaving behind a path of destruction through the forest.</span></p>
 <p><i><span>Hong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span>Within the rumbling sounds, the towering large trees torn apart one after another. These were trees with trunks so thick not even a dozen men would be able to wrap their hands around them! However, when the Green Scaled Eagle swooped down, its steel-like wings tore apart everything in its way, sending branches and leaves flying in disorder.</span></p>
 <p><span>There was a loud</span><i><span> peng</span></i><span> sound, and a giant mountain rock that was in its path was completely obliterated. Sparks flew everywhere and stones scattered randomly. Many heavy boulders weighing over a hundred jin were blasted into all directions, destroying the huge trees they collided into. It was an incredibly shocking sight.</span></p>
 <p><span>All the kids felt a chill run from their head down to their feet. This Green Scaled Eagle was simply too strong! If not for that piece of mountain rock blocking its attacks, many of them would most likely have been killed.</span></p>
 <p><span>After the Green Scaled Eagle destroyed a large portion of the mountain forest, it flew back into the sky and hovered in midair. Its sharp eagle eyes coldly stared downwards as it prepared to dive down once again. It was going to eliminate these fleeing children.</span></p>
 <p><span>“The village is not far from here. We need to hurry!” The children shouted loudly.</span></p>
