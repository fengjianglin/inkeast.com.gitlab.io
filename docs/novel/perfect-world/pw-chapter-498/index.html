It was as if his body was almost petrified. Only his hair was extremely long, and it covered his entire body like dried up yellow wild grass.</span></p>

It was unknown just how long these beautiful and astonishing streaks of light were. It made the hearts of every cultivator in this region beat ferociously, and they all felt as if they were suffocating.&nbsp;</span></p>

Five streaks of energy swirled about, forming the most simple type of great dao traces. They then turned into dazzling symbols that looked like interweaving rivers of stars.&nbsp;</span></p>

Tens of thousands of true spirits were engraved on top and filled with incomparable magic force.&nbsp;</span></p>

Even Shi Hao and the other Qin Clansmen couldn’t understand why the person suppressed under Five Phase Mountain didn’t move at all. He laid flat on the ground without making the slightest sound.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Five Phase Mountain was a bit astonished. During all these years, it did not involve itself in any of Qin Clan’s matters and laid dormant here to suppress this person.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was because it was scared of this individual escaping. The consequences of such a thing would be absolutely tremendous. As a result, Five Phase Mountain almost never left the ground.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since the ancient times, it had only awakened a few times. Unless the Qin Clan’s foundation was at risk of being destroyed, it would always remain silent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suppressing this individual was its most important task.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Were my efforts in vain? Could he have died already?” The little pagoda was clearly feeling as if its actions were not worth it. The battle this time didn’t bring back any returns, while he developed significant enmity with the other party. He naturally suffered quite a loss here.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chi!</span></p>

Everyone had petrified expressions on their faces. They simply couldn’t believe what was going on.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only a single lock of that creature’s yellow grass-like hair was sliced off. Its dried and withered flesh was unharmed, not being hacked apart at all. This did not make any sense! It left everyone absolutely horrified.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The level of hardness was simply unimaginable!</span></p>

The body on the ground moved a bit. Everyone present felt as if their hearts had shot up to their throats! He actually didn’t die!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the distance, Five Phase Mountain quickly arrived. It crossed the distance and released its annihilating power to try and suppress it again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He really didn’t die in the end. I knew that he was hard to kill. However, if he still didn’t move, my most powerful chaotic sword radiance would have hacked down on him.” The little pagoda quietly said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It then erupted with power again, rushing towards Five Phase Mountain to stop its descent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’ve gone mad! By freeing him, there will inevitably be a great calamity and chaos released upon this world!” Five Phase Mountain’s imposing and downcast voice carried a hint of anxiousness.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It had been created inside the primal chaos and was born with innate power. It was branded with the world’s imprint, which made it ridiculously powerful, yet today, it actually had to assume this type of attitude. It was enough to show just how terrifying this individual was.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why do I care? Better off releasing him into the higher realms and let some people feel some pain! Hah!” At that moment, the little pagoda’s words were rather crass, as if it couldn’t care less. It actually displayed this type of attitude.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Back then, it wasn’t a single person that took action to suppress him. By doing something like this, aren’t you scared that you’ll make many enemies?” Five Phase Mountain asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, the two clashed again. They faced off in an incredibly intense battle. At this level, a single streak of symbols or a single divine chain of order could collapse the heavens. A battle between such powerful individuals was an utterly terrifying event.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, they restricted their power so that it didn’t affect the other creatures. They only fought among themselves.&nbsp;</span></p>

Back then, those people tried to take action against me as well. There will be a battle between us sooner or later anyway!” The little pagoda said in an extremely cold tone. It was planning to release great disaster into the higher realms.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Previously, it had only had its own suspicions and didn’t know for sure whether that ‘disaster’ was sealed here. Before, it had even thought that it might be a trap.&nbsp;</span></p>

Sparks flew everywhere, and resounding metallic sounds rang through the air. It was shocking to an unbelievable level.&nbsp;</span></p>

He used this to fight back against the vicious attacks of time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite doing so, it still used energy, just that it was lowered to the minimal amount. He was able to stay alive and not pass away after all this time!</span></p>

His figure was small and withered, appearing incomparably frail and weak. However, after this revival and true awakening, everything became different.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under the disordered hair that was like wild grass, a pair of golden pupils shone. This immediately caused many people from the Qin Clan to cry out loudly. It was as if they were facing a hundred suns, and all of them closed their eyes. Blood flowed from the corners of their eyes, and they no longer dared to look straight at him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ka cha</span></p>

This individual sat down. He looked at the sky, and then at the great earth, not releasing a single sound during this entire process. His eyes then swept towards the little pagoda and Five Phase Mountain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Suppress!” Five Phase Mountain’s entire body shone. The five-colored light could obliterate the great world, and at this moment, it completely descended to suppress that creature again.&nbsp;</span></p>

He soundlessly opened his mouth, and then he took a deep breath. At this moment, this heaven and earth’s endless spiritual essence madly gathered.&nbsp;</span></p>

A few ancient sects’ powerful giants knew that the heavens were going to be changed. A matchless existence had escaped an entrapment and was replenishing his foundational essence. A major event was inevitably going to happen!</span></p>
