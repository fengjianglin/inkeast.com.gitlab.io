A lion-bodied human-faced monster rushed over, its entire body releasing golden light. It became faster and faster, exceeding other creatures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the end, it turned into a streak of golden lightning, cutting a thousand li through the air. A large claw slapped down, golden light surging endlessly, blasting the void apart. Black cracks extended outwards, the scene terrifying.</span></p>

Shi Hao faced it bare-handedly. A deafening noise erupted from the two, as if metal was colliding, sparks flying in all directions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Kill!” Shi Hao released a low shout, rising up, avoiding the other creatures and attacking this monster.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The lion-bodied human-faced monster was too fast, exceeding many people’s imaginations. It instantly rushed into the distance, a single jump taking it over a thousand li, simply impossible to catch up to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the speed of lightning.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Immediately afterwards, it rushed over again, baring its fangs and brandishing its claws, golden light rushing out in ten thousand streaks, blazing light endless, too resplendent. It was as if a giant divine lord was attacking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was, without a doubt, the leader of this region.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, many foreign creatures on the ground released great cries, their voices shaking heaven and earth, shouts of killing echoing through the world, the universe itself even greatly trembling!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ao…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The lion-bodied human-faced creature attacked, the first one to throw itself at Shi Hao again, a leap taking it a thousand li, speed too fast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Die!” At this moment, Shi Hao’s eyes also widened, deciding that he was going to kill it in one strike. He used his most powerful methods, or else the path later on would be even more difficult.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was because judging from the situation, it seemed like he had to move through the Nine Heavens Ten Earths, this was just the beginning!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His fists shone, gathering power, using everything he knew. Bone texts erupted, concentrating and interweaving on his fist. He used his own innate supreme being precious technique, Heaven’s Light!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This fist smashed out, heaven and earth losing color, wind and clouds exploding and scattering. It was just too shocking, as if a comet suddenly erupted here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That resplendent light illuminated the sky dome, also shining to the point where the faces of the young cultivators watching turned pale. They were deeply shocked, just how terrifying was Huang’s fighting strength!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The power displayed by this fist was too domineering, even if a Self Severing Realm cultivator went up, they would still be blown to pieces, right? They might very well die from this single hit!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now, Shi Hao’s power had already completely changed. After cultivating in seclusion for many years, refining his own talent, using the body as a seed, his strength shot up drastically. At the same time, his understanding towards his own innate precious techniques became even deeper, exceeding his past dao achievements!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His fist was like a small golden sun, dazzling, simply impossible to look straight at.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ao...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The lion-bodied human-faced monster roared. It faced Shi Hao’s fist, brandishing its great golden claws, moreover opening its bloody mouth, going all out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, in his surroundings, other creatures rushed over, all of them raising weapons, attacking at Shi Hao together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Peng!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao’s fist broke the golden monster’s great claw, moreover smashing straight into its bloody mouth, smashing its head apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hou!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The monster released an angry roar, quickly backing up. However, it was too hard for it to stop its head’s injury. In the end, with a&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">kacha&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">sound, it completely exploded to pieces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the most crucial juncture, the monster threw itself over, crossing a thousand li, directly turning into a golden streak of lightning. It was incredibly thick, hacking towards Shi Hao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thunder rumbled, lightning interweaved, their power astonishing, but all of it was scattered by Shi Hao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These creatures not only possessed true strength, because they were formed from lightning, when they were defeated, they would turn into lightning tribulation, equivalent to being able to carry out an attack a second time!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The golden monster was extremely strong, deserved to be called a leader, but it was still killed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Kill!” Human figures were everywhere, vast and boundless. There were foreign creatures all about, all of them rushing over murderously while raising weapons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Black iron spears, dazzling white long blades, scarlet sharp swords, war halberds dripping with blood…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cold metallic radiance flickered, killing energy overflowing into the heavens. This was a huge army of thousands, all of them rushing over together. Their speeds were too fast, impossible to hide from. It was because all of them were formed from lightning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Kill!” Shi Hao roared loudly. He began to go all out, his palms shining, a golden pike appearing in his hands, condensed from divine force, incomparably resplendent. He slaughtered his way forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just a single strike pierced through several extremely strong creatures. The spear erupted with radiance, crushing their weapons, piercing through the skies!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ka!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lightning interweaved, several people exploding, electric light shooting in thousands of streaks, blasting Shi Hao’s body, directly received by him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Charge!” Countless creatures charged forward fearlessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao’s eyes and eyebrows stood vertically, starting to brandish the spear. The weapon enlarged, becoming like a mountain ridge, sweeping in all directions. Lightning erupted, killing intent overflowing into the heavens!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Blood splashed in all directions, many creatures screaming miserably, swept through by the giant golden pike. Bones broke, muscles severed, all of them exploding to pieces, turning into bloody paste, and then into electrical light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a massacre. Shi Hao displayed divine might, fighting a great battle here, battling the foreign creatures fiercely. Dismembered limbs immediately flew out, blood dyeing the skies red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was especially the case when he saw the corpses of cultivators from the Nine Heavens everywhere, making his fighting spirit become even more ferocious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though it was only lightning tribulation, he still treated it like a true battle. He felt anger, his head raised to the sky, releasing a roar. A war spear was held in his hands, angrily stabbing in all directions, fighting with everything he had.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao was valiant and fearless, but the enemy army really was too large, more appearing the more he killed, seemingly endless, stretching as far as he could see, enemy troops filling the mountains and rivers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao killed until his eyes turned red, fighting a bloody battle here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, no matter how strong one was, there was no way they could handle this many enemies. It was as if he was submerged in a sea, surrounded by the foreign soldiers, the battles relentless, the reeking of blood assailing the senses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lightning erupted streak after streak, whenever an expert was killed, there would always be a streak of lightning hacking over, blasting his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This… is too terrifying!” All of the spectating youngsters were horrified. They never expected this heavenly tribulation to be this freakish, this frightening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was simply no path of life! It was just the beginning, yet it was already this intense. How was he supposed to make it through the rest?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One had to understand that the ‘Nine Heavens Ten Earths’ existed here. He had just begun, just ascending the three thousand provinces, the path to come was still extremely long!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How could there be this type of heavenly tribulation? There’s not even any hope of survival at all, simply a trial of death!” A few people sighed softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No hope could be seen in this type of heavenly tribulation, only despair!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Nine Heavens Ten Earths were filled with despair. To challenge everything alone, just how helpless and powerless of a matter was this? One would feel a deep helplessness and despair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao charged forward, advancing towards the center of this continent. Soon afterwards, he fought until his entire body was covered in blood, battle clothes in tatters, even hair drenched in blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For a lightning tribulation to reach this step, it can be considered unrivalled under the heavens. To target a cultivator like this, release this type of disaster, it really was terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The number one tribulation since ancient times shouldn’t be more terrifying than this!” Someone said quietly, feeling that Shi Hao might die. This type of tribulation couldn’t be crossed at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re wrong. This can most likely be considered an unprecedented heavenly tribulation. In this cultivation realm, there shouldn’t be anything more powerful than this.” Someone said with a sigh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was because in this era without heavenly tribulation, guiding tribulation down on oneself would make its power increase drastically. The heavenly tribulation would increase several fold, inevitably destroy the cultivator in one move, using this as the reply to those who proactively challenged it!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the most powerful heavenly tribulation to begin with, now with this type of added power, just how terrifying would it become? It could be called the most powerful of all of history, at the very least, unprecedented in this cultivation realm!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was an extremely terrifying thing. Shi Hao slaughtered his way into the continent’s depths, wishing to head to the other continents from that place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was because between the Nine Heavens Ten Earths, there were lightning bridges that connected them. He could only forge ahead step by step, and couldn’t directly rush into the sky. There was a terrifying power stopping him from doing so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This meant that he had to slaughter his way over, make his way through the Nine Heavens Ten Earths one after another, unable to skip a single one!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only, when he fought to this step, the first continent, which was also the Three Thousand Dao Provinces, before he even made it through, Shi Hao was already staggering about, entire body covered in injuries, blood dripping from his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a war spear that stabbed into his body, as well as several dozen arrows, and there was even a long blade that was embedded in his shoulder… it was an appalling sight, his injuries too serious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The most terrifying thing was that these weapons were all lightning, possibly exploding!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Break for me!” Shi Hao roared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lightning radiance erupted from his entire body. He operated the Lightning Emperor Precious Technique, stirring on lightning, forcefully expelling these weapons, make them explode outside his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was incredible fortune after misfortune. If they had exploded while inside his body, the consequences would be too horrible to think about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finally, Shi Hao encountered a creature that was especially strong, a creature with some King Clan bloodline, the highest leader of this place. With a roar, he slaughtered his way over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This creature was in the Self Severing Realm, scarlet hair flying about, eyes like copper, body massive. Brandishing a scarlet bone mace in its hands, its boldness unmatched!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A Self Severing Realm King Clan individual appeared! This is too freakish, there’s no way he can survive!” Many people’s expressions changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How was one even supposed to contend against this? The heavenly tribulation was too ferocious, impossible to face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao didn’t feel discouraged at all, his eyes were like lightning, flickering with divine light. He slaughtered his way forward, holding a lightning weapon in hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a battle of life and death, blood soaking through his battle clothes! Shi Hao fought with his utmost, couldn’t hold back. He fought a bloody battle with this king, and at the same time had to face the enemies in all directions, fight their great army.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This scene shocked many people. It was bitter, and it was also inspiring! It was because Shi Hao charged through the giant army alone, slaughtering from the east to the west, and then from the west back to the east. There were countless corpses under his feet, as if he was harvesting wheat, falling one after another. Blood flowed like rivers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They thought about how the ancient people were wiped out, massacred in the last great era, their side unable to defeat the creatures of the other side. They then saw this scene, the blood of the young cultivators watching also surging, surging with fighting spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He finally made it through!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao slaughtered his way out from this area, personally removing that king’s head. Even though there were weapons stabbed all over his body, he succeeded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He killed his way through, making it through the most crucial step!” Someone said with a sigh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao staggered forward, his body’s injuries too serious, already in tatters, full of cuts and holes. There were many areas that were scorched black too, blood soaking through his tattered battle clothes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He passed through the lightning bridge, arriving on the second continent, walking while treating his wounds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Kill…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, there were too many enemies, the giant army not giving him any time to rest. When they saw him, they directly surrounded him, attacking him fiercely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao entered a new battlefield, risking life and limb. There was no path of retreat now, he could only fight his way through. Or else what awaited him was only death, his body blasted to ashes!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He fought bloodily the entire time, slaughtering his way over. Along the way, Shi Hao fell several times, many people thought that he died, but he would crawl up again, and then continue forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just like that, he passed through trial after trial, actually making it through the Ten Earths.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This…” Many people were stupefied, almost not daring to believe what was happening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was because when it was most serious, lightning turned into a weapon, stabbed into Shi Hao’s body, and then it exploded, almost blasting his body rotten.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Succeeded! He made it through the Ten Earths, ascended into the Nine Heavens!” Someone cried out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a cheer, making everyone snap back to reality. When they saw that exhausted, wounded body, they were shocked, feeling that this was inconceivable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After bleeding, fighting this entire time, Shi Hao slaughtered his way into the Nine Heavens!</span></p>
