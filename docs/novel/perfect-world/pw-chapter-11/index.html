 <p><b>Chapter 11 – Ancestral Inheritance</b></p>
 <p><span>Everyone was dumbfounded.</span></p>
 <p><span>Outside the village, the vicious bird that seemed to have been forged from molten iron was also shaken. It suddenly raised its head, and two streaks of lightning-like beams of light were released from its eyes. It stared unwaveringly at that altar.</span></p>
 <p><span>As the tender willow branch brushed past the egg, tens of thousands streaks of multicolored light flowed past, auspicious and brightly colored. A hazy mist of light began to drift about. The egg seemed as if it underwent a divine transformation, and it currently appeared translucent and incredibly shocking.</span></p>
 <p><span>The spots on the shell illuminated, releasing a fierce and blazing radiance as if they were small suns. Exuberant life force emerged from within. In addition, more patterns began to form around the spots. The dazzling patterns were like serpents and dancing birds as they weaved about in complex and mysterious ways. </span></p>
 <p><span>Indescribable changes began to happen to the egg. The mysterious patterns interweaved rapidly, and soon after, the changes covered the entire egg. More and more gorgeous and splendid flowery patterns could be seen, and divine radiance flowed in all directions.</span></p>
 <p><span>“The life force within this egg became many times greater, and the life imprint passed down by the archaic demonic bird has recovered quite a bit of its power. If this egg hatches, it will definitely far surpass the Green Scaled Eagle!” Chief Shi Yunfeng cried out in shock.</span></p>
 <p><span>The egg was a bit special, and it was entirely possible for it to inherit quite a few fragments of the archaic demonic bird’s imprint. It was as if its power was restored to that of its ancestors! If it continued like this, then its bloodline would become even purer, making it far superior to its parents’.</span></p>
 <p><span>Just a slight movement of the old willow tree’s tender branch created such a shocking sight! Did it bring forth the hidden potential of the egg, or did it possess a type of mysterious power itself and allow the egg to undergo this transformation?</span></p>
 <p><span>The villagers were all shocked. As they looked at the egg shining in resplendent light, their eyes revealed a fiery radiance. This was definitely going to become a fearsome war bird with unlimited potential.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Green Scaled Eagle covered in dazzling scales perched atop a huge boulder outside the village. Both of its eyes released streaks of light as it stared intently; it seemed like it found it difficult to believe what was happening as well.</span></p>
 <p><span>It wanted to rush into the village to get a better look, but after seeing the old willow tree, it felt an instinctive fear that prevented it from getting closer. It could only cry out urgently outside.</span></p>
 <p><span>After the lovely and jade-like willow branch brushed past the egg, it no longer made any more movements.</span></p>
 <p><span>It was clear that it did not show any particular interest when it casually brushed the egg.</span></p>
 <p><span>The villagers all felt reverence, and only after a long time had passed did they calm down.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Chief, do we keep this egg?” asked Shi Linhu. Right now, the villagers were all moved and full of passion. This was a magical and precious egg, so it would be a shame to let such an opportunity go.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Do you all not see the vicious bird outside the village? If we keep the egg, it will definitely go crazy.” Shi Yunfeng frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span>The old willow tree was very mysterious and powerful. It constantly protected the village and obstructed ferocious beasts from destroying their home. Stone Village was its domain, but it was merely defending. It would never even move outside the village, let alone voluntarily attack something.</span></p>
 <p><span>That Green Scaled Eagle didn’t dare enter, but it only needed to block the village exit to torment Stone Village’s people. After all, the villagers still needed to hunt for food in the mountain range.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Forget it, let’s return this egg to that big furry bird,” an elder said.</span></p>
 <p><span>The villagers were all disappointed, but there was no other way. The Green Scaled Eagle was too powerful. It was this region’s apex predator. If creatures that lived in the depths of the mountain range didn’t come out, it would definitely be considered the overlord.</span></p>
 <p><span>A villager carefully and prudently delivered the three eggs to the village entrance under the protection of the two ancestral artifacts. He laid them on the grass before quickly returning.</span></p>
 <p><span>As of this moment, the mutated egg’s burning aura and radiance had already dissipated. However, the newly formed mysterious patterns never faded away, differentiating itself from the other two eggs, making it seem as if two different species of birds had laid these eggs.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Green Scaled Eagle flapped its wings, releasing a violent gust of wind and throwing itself over in an instant. Both wings moved to immediately protect all three eggs. Afterwards, it stared intently at that striped, and lustrous egg.</span></p>
 <p><span>After letting out a long hiss, this vicious bird seemed to have become extremely excited. Its voice resounded through the skies, trembling the fields and forests and leaving leaves fluttering wildly in the air.</span></p>
 <p><span>After a long while, it raised its head and revealed a strange look in its eyes. Its fearful radiance had long vanished. It stared at the old willow tree in the village, but it still didn’t dare take even half a step inside the village.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Hurry up and leave with your eggs already!” A few adults shouted as if chasing away an epidemic.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, beyond all expectation, the Green Scaled Eagle spread its wings, and after flapping furiously, it released a violent gust of wind, pushing the three eggs back into the village towards the willow tree.</span></p>
 <p><span>“What, it doesn’t want them? It’s giving them to us?” Everyone stood there in stupor. What was going on? Strange things were happening one after the other.</span></p>
 <p><span>“The Green Scaled Eagle recognized the fact that one of the eggs had evolved. The egg is now covered densely in mysterious symbols and would definitely surpass its mother in the future. It wants to offer it to us with the intent of having us raise it,” Chief Shi Yunfeng said.</span></p>
 <p><span>“It had these sort of thoughts?” The group of people were amazed.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Don’t forget that this is a vicious bird that condensed mysterious symbols within its body. It possesses an overflowing mysterious power within its bones, and its wisdom should not be inferior to that of a human’s,” the old chief said.</span></p>
 <p><span>The more formidable and unique the vicious bird was, the more wisdom it would possess. Legend has it that there were some archaic beings with intelligence that were vastly superior to even that of a human’s. They overlooked tribes as if they were deities.</span></p>
 <p><span>The village chief loudly inquired whether or not it really wanted to leave its descendants here. That Green Scaled Eagle actually nodded its head in response. It then hinted with its eyes, looking at the three eggs and then at the old willow tree.</span></p>
 <p><i><span>Hu!</span></i></p>
 <p><span>After creating a violent gale, the Green Scaled Eagle spread both its wings. They spanned roughly fifteen or sixteen meters as it rushed into the air. In the blink of an eye, It disappeared into the clouds.</span></p>
 <p><span>Everyone was stupefied. Was it going to leave just like this? There were three sparkling and translucent eggs left on the ground, and no one had expected that things would end up this way.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Uncle Linhu, what should we do now?” Er Meng asked.</span></p>
 <p><span>“What should you all do? This situation was caused by you kids, so you little brats need to take responsibility!” Shi Linhu scowled.</span></p>
 <p><span>“</span><i><span>Ah</span></i><span>, no! Save us!” The group of kids began to shriek miserably.</span></p>
 <p><span>The three eggs were placed beside the great willow tree’s altar. Some people were assigned to stand guard until the birds hatched. After all, these were the eggs of a powerful vicious bird, so they were extremely precious.</span></p>
 <p><span>After roughly a dozen days, a clear </span><i><span>kacha</span></i><span> sound rang out. A crack appeared on one of the eggs. The jade colored shell split open, and from inside tumbled out a little fellow covered in green sparkling scales.</span></p>
 <p><span>Following that, another egg also began to crack open, and what struggled out was a similar little bird. It stuck its head out and looked around with its bright eyes to observe its surroundings.</span></p>
 <p><span>The third egg was extremely special, and when that egg cracked open, rays of multicolored light shot in all directions. Afterwards, a chirp rang out, and the solid egg was suddenly completely smashed to pieces. The hatchling radiated with divine splendor.</span></p>
 <p><span>A young hatchling appeared. The scales on its body weren’t green, but rather purple. Light sparkled all around its body, as if a ball of fire was currently burning. It was quite a bit more mystical and mysterious than its two brothers.</span></p>
 <p><span>After a long while, the purple ball of light dissipated. This spiritually blessed hatchling was shrouded in brilliant purple scales. It’s vivacious large eyes moved about intelligently as it curiously looked at everyone. There was no doubt in anyone’s mind that this was an extraordinary bird.</span></p>
 <p><span>“They hatched!” A group of children cheered. They ran home to find some meat for these three new hatchlings.</span></p>
 <p><span>Suddenly, a long bird cry sounded. A huge vicious bird dove down from above the clouds. It rapidly approached Stone Village, casting down a large shadow.</span></p>
 <p><span>“</span><i><span>Yi</span></i><span>, it disappeared for half a month, but the Green Scaled Eagle returned again! Is it going to break its promise and take back its children?” Some villagers cried out in surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Hold on, what’s that?” The villagers were shocked, revealing amazement within their eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span>Hong! Dust flew up into the air. The Green Scaled Eagle loosened its claws, and a colossal monster smashed into the ground, creating a huge crater. Smoke and dust flew everywhere.</span></p>
 <p><span>It was a huge Dragon Horned Elephant roughly six to seven meters in length and five to six meters in height. The pair of dragon horns on its head gave off a splendid light, and the extremely heavy body easily easily snapped apart the ancient trees that reached into the skies. It had been dead for a while already. It’s huge skull already had several claw marks embedded into them, and blood was rushing out from its corpse. It was most likely killed in an instant!</span></p>
 <p><span>“Green Scaled Eagle what do you want us to do? Is this creature supposed to be used to feed the three hatchlings? You really are like a human, full of mighty wisdom!” The villagers gasped in admiration.</span></p>
 <p><span>After a short cry, a violent wind erupted, sweeping up the huge branches and leaves. The Green Scaled Eagle once again soared towards the heavens.</span></p>
