This was the same as the direction where he saw that silver flash. In that case, did the bone bracelet the female emissary who came from the prefectural city carry a formidable secret treasure that could sense the individual in the painting?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He secretly brought out the dual pupil and looked around. He discovered that at the end of the horizon, there was a silver streak of divine light that disappeared with a flash. It then completely vanished.&nbsp;</span></p>

He had to cultivate his own dao heavenly eye. He always used this dual-pupil, making him quite dependent on it. He still needed his own heavenly eye!</span></p>

Even the city master’s daughter's face became a bit pale at this moment. She understood well how terrifying this mysterious woman was.&nbsp;</span></p>

They only came to find a few clues and wouldn’t try to fight her at all. Even if the other party was seriously injured, this was not someone she could fight.&nbsp;</span></p>

It could protect her, but if she went out to fight the silver haired woman, she would definitely be in danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wait here, no one is allowed to act recklessly. Wait for that great one to come!” The silver robed girl’s tone was extremely strict.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A few minutes later, thunderous sounds rang through the air. This world was trembling in response, shaking everyone until their blood was surging. A crack appeared in the void, arriving with extreme speed. It was just too terrifying.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was too fast, leaving all of the cultivators staring in disbelief. He arrived from the horizon in an instant.</span></p>

An indistinct figure appeared that was flowing with endless radiance. He towered in midair like a supreme heavenly deity. Everyone couldn’t help but feel an urge to kneel down and kowtow.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They couldn’t see his true body. It was wrapped within resplendent symbols that were mysterious and powerful. However, they could sense that this was a young male. His aura was heaven overflowing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was like a True Dragon that had emerged in this world. Everyone felt as if their souls were trembling. The only thing they could see clearly was that pair of eyes. They were incomparably deep. The scene inside was extremely shocking. There were stars moving about one after another. Chaotic energy pervaded the air, as if the heavens was reopening!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was clearly a pair of eyes, but they displayed such a terrifying scene!</span></p>

Glimpse of symbols could be seen. It was terrifying to an intimidating level. It was as if it was going to hide back into nothingness, a weapon that was strange and terrifying to the extreme.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Void halberd!</span></p>

This was a precious artifact that was extremely difficult to find, one that was formed from a void beasts’ primordial true bone. That was why he could directly arrive from the distance by piercing through the void.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A precious artifact that was powerful to this degree was perhaps something only Immortal Palace’s young great one could possess. Its value was immeasurable, because it was just too hard to get!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Where?” His voice was calm. Everyone knew that this was definitely a cool-headed person full of confidence and power.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Great one, she went in that direction.” The silver robed woman pointed in a direction outside the city. Only now did her expression slightly improve.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You do not need to worry. The golden bone bracelet I gave you can completely protect you.” Immortal Palace’s young great one calmly said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I understand!” The silver robed woman nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the sky, the young man that held the void halberd was like a divine king. Every inch of his flesh was surging with divine symbols. His long hair scattered about. He closed his eyes and silently sensed his surroundings. A wave of power that seemed to contain both secrecy and power swept through this place, making everyone’s minds jump.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fortunately, he was just looking for that silver-haired woman and not dealing with the people here. Otherwise, the leaders of the tribes and their youth would have all fallen weak onto the ground.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It should be one of her spiritual bodies that purposely led me here.” A moment later, Immortal Palace’s young great one spoke. He was still calm and not flustered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I apologize, great one.” The silver robed woman blamed herself and lowered her head in shame. Even though her status was unordinary, compared to this male in front of her, the difference was too great.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Immortal Palace’s young great one would inevitably overlook the upper bound of the higher realms and rule over three thousand provinces. Not many people could be mentioned on equal terms with him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The great halberd’s power was exceptional. It could pierce through the void and allow him to weave about under the sky. He could go wherever he pleased.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, he stopped again, not walking out. He said to himself, “Perhaps she is still trying to confuse me. It might not be a spiritual body. Her true body might be here too.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His eyes swept over everyone again. Everyone’s heart rates accelerated, feeling a tremendous pressure. Their souls were about to explode.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What kind of power was this? Just his gaze alone was difficult to endure!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“All of you, continue your search. If there is anything, immediately report to me.” Immortal Palace’s young great one held the void halberd, and with a&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">peng</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">, the void was pierced. A great roaring voice sounded. He pierced through the void and rushed outside the city.&nbsp;</span></p>

He was quite envious of the halberd. This was a priceless treasure. When could he obtain something like that too? When he was in the lower realm, he knew that Shi Yi also had a similar precious artifact.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unfortunately, this type of thing could only be stumbled upon and not begged for. It was hard to find in the entire world. Only those with great luck could own them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, Shi Hao thought of that rumor. He learned from Immortal Mountain when he was in the lower realm that a dual pupils expert appeared in the higher realms as well, his power shaking Heavenfall Province. He was extremely outstanding, and later on, he joined Heavenfall Academy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is it him?” Shi Hao didn’t know. He couldn’t even ascertain whether Shi Yi was still alive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After this event, the arena’s people’s hearts were rising and falling. The tribes’ youngsters were all frustrated. Their ages were similar, but compared to the geniuses of the outside world, it was just too great of a difference.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“All of you do not need to feel frustrated. Just now, that individual could overlook all three thousand provinces and has unmatched characteristics. He isn’t someone in the same world as you all. Do not think too much of it.” The old city master of Scholar Tree City consoled.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In addition, he told everyone that if their performance in the selection competition was good, they could enter a few sects and improve themselves. This was a rare opportunity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The disturbance cut the selection competition short. They decided to carry it out tomorrow.</span></p>

There were quite a few mysterious figures that came to the city. They were all looking for something. These individuals possessed outstanding strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Supreme experts?” Shi Hao’s mind jumped. He saw a few people who were all in the supreme expert realm. However, their identities were only eervants. They were only here to collect information.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He became even more careful. The people that were coming were more and more formidable. They roamed about this place.&nbsp;</span></p>

They were all looking for the silver haired girl. It was quite an irregular situation.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The next day, inside the arena. The youth from every tribe were present. The selection competition began. This was the stage where everyone had gathered at. It was extremely important.&nbsp;</span></p>

There is no need for life and death battles. The main thing is to test your potential.”</span></p>

If they didn’t have that type of power, as long as their talent was good enough, they could also be selected by some inheritances. This was an opportunity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Inside the arena were powerful stone shields. There were extremely heavy bronze cauldrons as well. The first test was one of physical strength.</span></p>

They walked up one after another. The other tribes’ people were like this as well. They adjusted their breathing and circulated their bodies’ power.&nbsp;</span></p>

This wasn’t bad, drawing others’ attention.</span></p>

His upper body was naked, revealing his bronze skin that was flickering with radiance. He released a loud shout, and with a&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">honglong</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;sound, he immediately raised a nine thousand jin great cauldron.&nbsp;</span></p>

He casually raised a millstone before putting it down. He suddenly raised his head and looked into the distance, revealing a look of shock.&nbsp;</span></p>

That same day, another ‘exceptional talent’ came. This was definitely not normal. Did they all come for that silver haired woman?!</span></p>

Rumor has it that he is several times more powerful than his younger brother, a heavenly genius of this generation.” Shi Hao had once ascended in the Void God Realm and fought a great battle against the younger brother on the Bronze Sparrow Altar. That person’s strength was quite great.&nbsp;</span></p>
