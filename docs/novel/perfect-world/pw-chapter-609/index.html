Stellar splendor scattered down onto this world.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“These people have truly done evil! For the sake of coming down into this world, just how many lives have they harmed! They truly deserve to be punished!” The old village chief said with his eyes widened. His body reeked of alcohol.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone carried resentment. For the sake of coming down into this realm, they carried out a blood sacrifice, completly treating the people of this world like domesticated animals and not like living beings. It was a cruel and bloody event that made everyone furious.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When this was brought up, Dazhuang, Ermeng, and the other youngsters’ blood began to boil. They really wanted to take action themselves and kill those people, wiping them out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moonlight interweaved. The lake surface was bright and clear like sapphire. It was now late into the night and many people had passed out from intoxication, lying on the ground. Only a small group was still drinking around the bonfire. Their faces had long become red and their speech inarticulate.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Child, when you enter the higher realms, you must be careful! Rumors have it that it is an unimaginably large place! Any province is larger than all of the lower realms. It is an incomparably vast place, a world without borders,” said Shi Linhu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Right! That place is too mysterious. There are taboo existences and gods. It is a place full of unknowns, and endless races exist above. Experts were as common as trees in a forest. You have to be careful!” Pihou was already drunk. He was also warning Shi Hao, feeling reluctant to part.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During this year, they had learned quite a bit about the higher realms from Qin Yining and the others. They were on guard against that vast and unknown world. It made them feel rather tense.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I will pay attention,” Shi Hao said with a smile. Right now, this world was without a little Stone. Everyone thought that he had died, so there shouldn’t be any dangers once he went up. Once he arrived there, he could travel about and strengthen himself. Once he truly began to contend against others, he might grant them some ‘nice surprises’.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ve had some time to think recently. A few years later when I get tired of this place, I will give the higher realms a look too.” Little Red said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“After taking more than a year to recover, my injuries are pretty much healed now too. I don’t mind looking around there too.” Hairy Ball spoke. An alcoholic scent wafted around him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hairy Ball and Little Red had suffered grave injuries after fighting against that Western Sect expert. They had lost half their bodies before finally taking the other party down after risking their lives. After taking more than a year to recover, they were finally able to regrow their lost limbs and body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I heard that the two realms are no longer linked up now. The heavenly paths have been broken and that it is already impossible to make contact between realms.” Shi Feijiao mentioned this matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In addition, this was information from two months ago. They recently sealed up the altar, cutting off all connections with the outside world. They reckoned that it would be even harder to communicate with the higher realms now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">En</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">, that is how it is. It is rumored that those undying great sects, for example, Immortal Mountain, Western Sect, and the others cannot send information down from the higher realms anymore.” Qingfeng nodded and said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao frowned. If they truly did cut off the heavenly path, it would bring quite a bit of trouble to his plans of ascending. However, he believed that there was definitely a path he could still take.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was now very late into the night. Stellar radiance scattered down. A group of people laid down on the grassy area. They were all drunk, and not even Shi Hao was an exception. It was because he was too happy, so he completely let his body and mind go.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only in the early morning when the Octadic Treasure Chicken cried out a few times did the drunk group of people wake up one after another. They all laughed heartily.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little Uncle Hao, we cooked beast milk for you! Here!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The women and children went to sleep relatively earlier. They didn’t drink until they passed out, so they naturally woke up earlier. Right now, a group of children ran over while giggling endlessly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao grabbed one of them and flicked him in the forehead, causing that little fellow to cry out in pain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Little Uncle Hao, look, we really did cook some! It smells good! Hurry and drink it! Afterwards, bring us into the mountains. It’s been so long since we went into the great wastelands!” A child shouted.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sure enough, steam was rising from a pot containing white liquid. Its fragrance wafted through the air. The children raised it up, expressing their ‘filial piety’.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was clearly a bribe for Shi Hao to bring them into the mountains so they could run everywhere and do whatever they wanted.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hehe…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Huzi, Snot Baby, Pihou and the others were all smiling as they looked at Shi Hao, waiting for him to act embarrassed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao also laughed, calmly accepting the pot from the children’s hands before drinking it with&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">gudong gudong</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;sounds. Finally, he wiped away the milkstains from the corners of his lips and said in praise, “Tasty, flavor isn’t bad!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This made Dazhuang, Pihou, Qingfeng, and the others who watched stupefied and completely speechless. They didn’t know what to say.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You little brat!” Shi Linhu and the others all laughed as well. They couldn’t help but shake their heads.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The group of children were dumbstruck. They originally wanted to express some kindness, and even though they did want to bribe Shi Hao, they definitely didn’t think he would drink it. However, now, he completely emptied that bowl.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right at that moment, a little fella that just learned how to walk pouted and mumbled, “That was our breakfast… Little Uncle Hao drank it all…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the side, there were two precious little girls who weren’t two years old yet. They were also pouting, looking like they were going to cry. “Little Uncle Hao, you stole our beast milk…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Shi Hao couldn’t maintain his confident and thick-skinned expression anymore. He immediately ran away, returning to the village chief’s courtyard.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Haha…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The villagers roared with laughter.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The following days were filled with happiness and laughter. Shi Hao satisfied all of the children’s wishes, bringing them into the great wastelands, allowing them to explore as they wished.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During this period of time, the big red bird, divine striking stone, and the others returned as well. They all began to cry out noisily. Being able to meet again alive was truly a happy thing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone would drink by the lake every day, talking deep into the night. They all felt cheerful and joyful.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During this period of time, Shi Hao roamed through the great wastelands, entering countless deep and profound primitive areas. All signs of human habitation in these places had been wiped out, and it had been many tens of thousands of years since anyone has set foot here. Apart from bringing back a dozen or so spiritual medicines and planting them in Stone Village, he also brought back a few auspicious beasts and propitious birds. Even though they weren’t comparable to the Octadic Treasure Chicken, they were still rare.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“These are Silver Spirit Loaches?” The old village chief was astonished. He had seen records of this type of creature before. It was entirely silver-white and carried a fragrance with it. It would grow up to a foot at the largest. This was an extremely rare creature.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The medicinal value of the Silver Spirit Loach was incredibly great. It could strengthen muscles, bones, and nourish the flesh. This was an extremely precious spiritual creature.&nbsp;</span></p>

They were all released into Stone Village’s lake. This lake was similarly protected by the village’s great formation, so it had long become a spiritual lake.&nbsp;</span></p>

Those broken bones recombined, and the scars in his flesh all disappeared. His entire body was brilliant and pure white like jade. His blood energy was roiling like a great river.&nbsp;</span></p>
