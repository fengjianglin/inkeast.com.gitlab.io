 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the darkness, Shi Hao felt as if his head, torso, and four limbs were divided, falling into the magma, burned until only bones were left. He felt incomparable pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he believed firmly that this was only him losing his mind, not something that was truly happening!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What underworld, what heavenly devils and gods weeping and howling, true immortal having its body torn apart? All of it was fake, all illusions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He believed firmly that he was standing in the same place, just that he was immersed in a type of spiritual world, and that was why all of these things were happening. He couldn’t help but feel shock towards the Yellow Springs Fruit’s medicinal effects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was because everything was too real, with almost no holes in these scenes, as if he was truly experiencing cruel torment, not like it was fake at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He roared loudly, wishing to regain his consciousness in this nightmare, completely wake up and grasp everything!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if this was a form of tempering for the mind, an essential tribulation he had to face for strengthening his spiritual force, he still wanted to be on the initiative to throw himself in, not be passively trapped like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The darkness was endless, surrounding this place. Shi Hao’s will became more and more blurry, as if he was about to disappear, enter an eternal nothingness!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Everything here is fake! Why aren’t you waking up yet?!” Shi Hao roared at himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only, when he opened his mouth, blazing magma poured in, but then it flowed back out from his throat. He felt as if he didn’t have any flesh, only his skull and bones of his four limbs floated in the red liquid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Why was it this real? Why couldn’t he wake up?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao tried again and again to wake up, using all types of methods to stimulate himself, but his will instead became more and more blurry, about to disappear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This won’t work, if I fall into darkness like this, will I never be able to wake again?” Shi Hao’s consciousness thought within this weakness, feeling a bit frightened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His suffering really was too great, his experiences extremely strange. If he sunk into the sea of magma and entered a thorough muddle-headedness, was something unexpected going to happen?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if it was the will of the world, in a dreamland, if he suffered damage here, would it affect his cultivation?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Laughable, this is a true hell, the Yellow Springs Fruit is able to link up the two worlds. There is a set of bizarre symbols within them that could open the void and serve as a shaft, dragging you into the underworld.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the darkness, there was this type of cold voice that sounded, ruthless and without any fluctuations, as if it was an arbiter speaking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why is it called the Yellow Springs Fruit? It is because it contains the coordinates of hell, able to open up the realm gate and bring you straight into the underworld. If you die here, then your life will come to an end. If you live, then your mind will be tempered.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That person didn’t display joy or worry as he spoke like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao was perplexed. His will was extremely powerful, but just now, the pain was unendurable, his body torn apart by chains, and then magma that could burn gods and devils to death poured down onto him, too difficult to bear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, he began to develop doubts. Wasn’t this a dream produced by the Yellow Springs Fruit? Could it be a true experience, the so-called divine fruit’s symbols really able to open up a gate in the void?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao was frightened; all of this was just too terrifying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he still didn’t believe it too much. That type of fruit would be just too heaven-defying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He couldn’t lose consciousness now. Regardless of whether what he was experiencing was real or fake, it would be beneficial for him to remain clear-headed; otherwise, he would be in huge trouble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, he felt as if his bones were shattering, completely burned down. His primordial spirit also began to break apart, splitting into several pieces, and then it quickly dimmed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why does it feel this real? Am I going to die?” Shi Hao still wasn’t willing to believe this. However, the intense pain of his primordial spirit splitting apart and the feeling that he was dying was just too real.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the end, he couldn’t hold on anymore. Endless darkness surrounded him, his spiritual awareness scattering. He felt like he was starting to fade away from existence, about to disappear forever.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, he didn’t even have the ability to think anymore. He really couldn’t hold on any longer, about to return to the earth and dust, forever extinguished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the end, with a&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">hong</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;sound, he lost consciousness. Endless darkness drowned out this place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Just too strange!” In the final instant, Shi Hao released a weak strand of consciousness. If it was fake, then it was too realistic, simply impossible to distinguish from reality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If ti was true, then he was definitely dead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After who knew how much time had passed, a white bone island rose from the magma, rising from the scarlet red ocean surface. It was as if many years had already passed, a bit of phosphorescence flickering about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A strand of soul flame appeared from within this radiance, extremely bright and brilliant, somewhat standing out from the masses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who am I?” He released this type of vague consciousness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, he saw a dark sword core, a tattered skeleton, and even a rust-filled lightning emperor armor; it was just this familiar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I have some impression. When looking at these things, it’s as if I experienced a person’s entire life.” That soul flame released a low voice, and then it couldn’t help but cry out, as if it was in extreme pain, frantically trying to recall something.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just like that, many years passed. On this white bone mountain, a few soul flames emerged, and then went out again. There was only that one strand that was the most special, moving around a sword core, armor, and other things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only this day did he obtain new memories from those objects. He saw two pieces of white bones that were different.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“True Primordial Record, Ten Thousand Spirit Diagram…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He recalled these two things with difficulty. Then, he struggled fiercely, filled with unwillingness, as well as a type of despair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I am someone called Huang, I am a heavenly emperor,or I am Shi Hao?” He seemed to be talking about himself, yet was also questioning this soul’s intrinsic quality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only, he couldn’t recall any details, only a vague and rough impression. He was suffering greatly, wishing to know what exactly happened in the past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just like that, he thought bitterly every day, struggling. When facing these remains that were not destroyed, some memories arose from time to time, spiritual light fragments flickering occasionally, allowing him to recall many things of the past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Year after year passed. In this place, time was the least valuable, continuously flowing on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In an instant, several decades passed. This soul hovered around these objects, recalling more and more things. His past gradually became clearer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I am Shi Hao, I ate a Yellow Springs Fruit, fell into the underworld, but couldn’t stick it through, dying here…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he learned the truth, this soul was stupefied. The past happiness, anger, sorrow, joy, the various things of the mortal world, his past close friends, everything was now far away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He couldn’t help but release a cry, screaming like a malicious spirit, the sound echoing for a long time in this place!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he recalled what happened of his life, he was full of unwillingness, carrying too many regrets. Did he really die just like that? He already parted from those he was close to, silently being buried alone here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This isn’t real!” He howled out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time flowed on. He felt the years elapse one after another, all the way until a century passed. Only then did his wounded heart start to calm down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Time is ruthless, a hundred years passed. My experiences were actually real?” When he recalled the events of the past, Shi Hao was stunned. The last hope he carried in the depths of his heart no longer existed either. A hundred years passed, time wasn’t fake, so what else was there to say? It was too cruel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I still want to return to the human world to see my loved ones, see those who I am close to!” This soul flame throbbed, releasing powerful energy fluctuations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“When your desire is powerful enough, it is possible to reincarnate you.” Within that sea of magma, a heartless voice sounded once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon afterwards, a disk appeared, &nbsp;full of reincarnation power. It emerged from the magma, continuously rotating. There were several areas, displaying the world that needed to be reincarnated into.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">xiu</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;sound, that soul flame was sucked into that disk, and then it fell into the black hole that it opened up, thus sent out to be reborn.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The various things that happened in the previous life appeared in his mind one after another. Within the joys and sorrows of life, there were a few people’s faces that appeared, the happiness and sadness of life now truly reflected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao released a sigh. Did this life pass just like this? He really found this hard to accept.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What is the outside world like? I wanted to go back and give that world a look, see how those people are all doing.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He carried bitterness and regret. After he was devoured by the black hole, he was reduced to a pure soul consciousness, and now, he was sent out to be reincarnated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, he felt as if he became an infant that wasn’t even born yet, still in the mother’s womb, nurtured by the natural essence of the world, not absorbing the mortal world’s turbid energy yet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A reincarnation while retaining memories?” Shi Hao silently thought to himself. He operated the True Primordial Record, the Willow Deity Technique he cultivated and other things, absorbing wisps of natural essence from this world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He wanted to use this to strengthen himself and nurture the mother body, but he discovered that it was extremely difficult.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Yellow Springs Fruit… really is strange!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After who knew how much time had passed, when the infant was about to be born, Shi Hao suddenly gained a flash of enlightenment, as if he completely understood something. He firmly believed that this type of reincarnation didn’t exist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Even though I don’t understand how a hundred years passed just like that, how everything was that lifelike, even my mind unable to distinguish reality from illusion, I strongly believe that this is a great dream, what I experienced is not real! I am Huang, I am Shi Hao, I want to wake up!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unfortunately, there was no so-called ‘waking up’. In the following years, he experienced the fate of mankind. This world did not have abundant essence energy, long entering its last days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only the essence energy he acquired in the mother’s womb was effective. After he was born, it was extremely difficult to acquire more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Eventually, he lived to the age of a hundred and sixty, becoming someone of considerable age. However, compared to his previous generation, this declining era was too poverty-stricken, not allowing for cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, Shi Hao was reincarnated once more, being transmigrated again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn’t say a single thing during this entire process, carrying his memories as he was reincarnated, experiencing the weakening of age and death. He remained silent most of the time, not uttering a sentence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only when he reached this world, when he entered that underworld again, did he hear that emotionless voice. “After reincarnating several times, what kind of fond memories have you gained?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yellow Springs Fruit, you really are strange!” Shi Hao spoke this sentence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finally, the world became chaotic, heaven and earth breaking apart, magma surging, sending Shi Hao out from this hell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao woke up, now standing before three stalks of golden and resplendent plants. Holy multicolored light poured out, brilliant and divine, several Yellow Springs Fruits hanging from them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A great dream!” Shi Hao sighed with admiration, at the same time filled with joy inside. It was because his primordial spirit force had been substantially strengthened, becoming a lot stronger!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How could someone have this type of primordial spirit while in the Heavenly Deity Realm? He was greatly satisfied!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, soon afterwards, divine light erupted from his eyes, and then his pupils rapidly contracted, his breathing immediately becoming rushed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment he lowered his head, he saw a few diagrams in his palm. They were small, but they were quite real. Four diagrams, all of them reincarnation imprints!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What was going on?!” Shi Hao cried out!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These were exactly the same as the imprints that were applied in the land of reincarnation before he was transmigrated, each time one imprint applied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now, there were four of them in total at the center of his palm, and in that realistic dream, he had previously reincarnated four times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a faint recording in a bone book of this great era, and in the jade heavenly books of Immortal Ancient, there were even more so some explanations. There were people who said that there was reincarnation, only, it wasn’t something everyone could carry out, only a select few exceptional heavenly talents had a chance of reincarnating, and that this was proved by those individuals who had reincarnation imprints.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only, very few people could imitate and carve down those types of imprints!</span></p>
