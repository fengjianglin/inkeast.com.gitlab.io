He thought that he could immediately get rid of that old servant with his magical force immunity and also capture that War Race descendant.&nbsp;</span></p>

He had an ancient magical artifact, a pure white jade bottle, and this bottle was going to suck him inside. His magical force immunity was ineffective!</span></p>

He was being sucked towards the precious bottle and was already by the bottle’s opening.</span></p>

It was spotlessly white and shining with a few extremely special symbols. It could collect tall mountains and great rivers. This bottle was extremely terrifying and extraordinary.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You all capture that woman. I will kill him.” The youngster was rather content. This was the first time he activated the bottle, yet it unexpectedly succeeded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Break!”</span></p>

At this moment, he couldn’t care about anything else anymore. His entire body erupted with symbols. A piece of yellow earth shot out from the pill furnace and smashed forward.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"What kind of thing is this?" The youngster cried out.</span></p>

The symbols on the bottle began to corrode. The bottle quickly dimmed and lost its luster.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao was already close to the opening of the bottle. It was just too dangerous, almost being sucked inside. However, when he was several feet away from the opening, he seized this opportunity and finally broke free.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Impossible, this precious artifact is a rare secret treasure and about to become a heavenly deity magical artifact. How could it suddenly stop working?!” The youngster was going crazy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was an old ancestor that doted on him quite greatly, bestowing him with this magical artifact and having him enter the Blood Plains to gain experience. Normally speaking, nothing should be able to destroy it, yet now, it began to corrode.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao quickly enlarged in size again, quickly turning from two inches in height back to his normal size. He landed on the ground, and then he ferociously took action, rushing murderously towards the the Divine Flame Realm old servant.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In his opinion, this was the most dangerous individual right now. As long as he could get rid of him, then the situation would be a lot more predictable.</span></p>

There was still a final bit of time. The two individuals engaged each other. Bloody light surged. The old man’s arms broke and he flew outwards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You…” He was shocked.&nbsp;</span></p>

He was still activating the jade bottle, but unfortunately, it was useless. He tried to get rid of the yellow earth with other magical artifacts, but they were all destroyed in the end.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The yellow earth’s background was extraordinary, originating from the boundless uninhabited region. Of course, it was not the true yellow earth and instead something that formed while permeated in the real piece of yellow earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though this was the case, it still made a secret treasure ineffective.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The group that surrounded Yun Xi were greatly alarmed. They wanted to escape, but it was too late. Shi Hao took action decisively, killing them one after another. No one could get away.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s now your turn.” Shi Hao pressed forward, taking action against that youngster.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This battle was without any suspense. Even though this young War Race youth was unordinary, he only survived a few dozen moves against Shi Hao in the end before dying.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In reality, in the same generation, there weren’t many people who could exchange several dozen moves with Shi Hao. What he accomplished was already quite a rare thing that few could accomplish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Shi Hao put away the yellow earth and carefully examined the fine jade bottle. He was a bit speechless. This was a quite a good treasure, but a lot of its symbols had been damaged.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What a pity…” He felt rather regretful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You actually stopped a divine artifact!” Yun Xi was shocked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Through this battle, Shi Hao was given a wake up call. The magical force immunity was not unmatched. Against a true deity, he could only retreat, and against higher level magical artifacts, it wouldn’t necessarily activate either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two quickly left, going on their way again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Have we been locked onto by someone? Even though I am hiding in your cauldron, why do they still always find us?” Yun Xi revealed a worried look.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was because as they continued, Shi Hao encountered danger several times. Yun Xi hid in the cauldron, but she could still feel how intense the battles outside were.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After several instances of this, she freed herself from the cauldron. When she came out, she found that Shi Hao’s face was pale, and his clothes were covered in traces of blood.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s not that we were targeted, but rather that there were too many War Race troops eliminated by us. They issued a death order that anyone that isn’t part of the War Race is to be killed on the spot.” Shi Hao’s complexion was not good. His face lacked color. Not long ago, he unexpectedly encountered a War King, this race’s outstanding genius. However, they weren’t even able to exchange blows, because a True deity appeared at the War King’s side, chasing him down the entire time and almost killing him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During the latter half of the night, he suffered another injury. His entire body was covered in blood. He was almost killed by that True deity. More than ten bones were broken, and there was a crack between his brows.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao’s injuries were extremely severe. If not for the Earth into inches great divine ability being formidable, granting him the earth escape technique and allowing him to enter the depths of the battlefield, he would have died right there and then.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite this being the case, his injuries were still extremely serious. His foundation was damaged.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Xi freed herself from the bone cauldron and appeared in front of him. When she saw this scene, she felt extremely uncomfortable, and tears appeared in her eyes. “I’m sorry, I’ve involved you in my troubles…” She told Shi Hao to continue alone and not worry about her any longer.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You don’t have to blame yourself. Even if I leave alone, I won’t be able to leave. The War Race wouldn’t give up,” Shi Hao said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Xi sighed softly. This kindness was too great. Shi Hao escorted her several hundreds of thousands of li. If not for this youth being here, she would have long been captured or killed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you.” She didn’t know what was proper to say.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You two won’t be able to get away.” Suddenly, an ice cold voice sounded. A line of people pressed forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Among them was a young man who was twenty or so years old. His long eyebrows reached his temples, his eyes like those of a phoenix. His skin was like white jade, flickering with sparkling radiance. There was a unique type of charm to his appearance.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had hurried over, and it was precisely him that spoke.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you dare fight against me alone?” Shi Hao’s body was covered in blood. He stood up, exuding a type of intimidation without anger. It was as if a tiger or dragon was making its appearance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I originally still intended to take action, but what a pity, right now, you are unsuitable. With such severe injuries, any supreme expert can kill you.” The War King spoke with an incredibly cold and merciless voice.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had this type of confidence, and even more so a type of unequalled mentality. The War Race had previously ruled the world, an Emperor Clan. How could the War King of this type of terrifying ancient clan that only produced someone like him once every dozen generations be ordinary?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the current world, three War Kings existed, but this was definitely an extremely rare thing.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t want to dirty my hands.” The War King carried his hands behind him. His phoenix-like eyes were chilly, his skin pure white like jade. Even his hair was sparkling and shining. His entire body gave off an otherworldly aura.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a type of humiliation. He looked down on Shi Hao in his current state, feeling that it was beneath him for them to fight. He felt that this person was not worth his time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Kill him for me.” He turned around, showing disdain beneath contempt.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon receiving the order, a few supreme experts rushed over.&nbsp;</span></p>

He turned around to escape, entering the depths of the earth again. The True deity pursued him closely!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he appeared on the surface again, the glaring red light of three blood moons seeped through the ancient battlefield. However, it was still unable to conceal the pallor of Shi Hao’s face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His injuries were too severe. More than ten of his bones were broken. His arm and leg bones were even more so broken at several areas. If not for his magical force supporting him, he would already be lying on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In addition, regardless of whether it was his primordial spirit or his flesh, they both suffered horrifying injuries, harming his foundation. If this continued, he really might die from his foundation being dried up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You… what’s wrong?” Yun Xi felt anxious. She brought out a bit of spiritual spring to have him drink it. Her stunning face was full of worry.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let me rest for a bit.” Shi Hao was extremely exhausted. Just now, he suffered another blow from the true deity at a distance. His body almost broke apart and his primordial spirit almost scattered.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His breathing was unstable. His chest was rising and falling intensely. He had been chased after this entire time. Now that the great battle reached this state, it took a huge toll on his body. It was hard for him to even stand up again. His injuries were terrifying.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t worry, you will recover again.” Yun Xi seemed to have thought of something. While sobbing, she quickly produced a pill medicine and had him eat it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is this?” Shi Hao was shocked. This pill was the size of a dragon eye fruit and curling with purple light. Symbols wrapped about it. It was as if it had life, smashing about the jade container with&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">peng peng</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;sounds, as if it was trying to escape.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is a Celestial pill, a unique precious medicine. No matter how severe your injuries are, it can immediately help you recover,” Yun Xi explained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao was shocked. This pill was priceless as expected. It was just like the Heaven Mending pill, able to save a person’s life.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he was in the lower realm, he had seized a Heaven Mending pill from Yue Chan. However, after that final battle against the seven deities, the villagers had forced him to eat it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason he was able to revive might not be because of the holy medicines, rebirth ponds, or his powerful will. Perhaps it was related to the Heaven Mending pill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hurry and eat it. We cannot waste any time.” Yun Xi’s sparkling white jade hand personally brought the Celestial pill to the edge of his mouth, touching his lips.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao nodded, not refusing her kindness. It was because his injuries were too severe and he couldn’t hold on any longer. Being able to escape with his life from a True deity’s clutches was already extremely heaven defying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If he didn’t immediately recover, once their pursuers arrived, both him and Yun Xi would undoubtedly die.</span></p>

It immediately rushed towards his limbs and bones, nourishing his flesh and primordial spirit. The effects were quite heaven defying!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were no side effects. In just an hour, Shi Hao stood up again, vigorous and healthy. He was surging with blood energy, and his spirit was abundant. He had recovered to his peak state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The effects are this great?” Even though he was inwardly prepared for the results, he was still extremely shocked.</span></p>

Her beautiful eyes moved about. Her skin was snow white, her smile displaying great beauty.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was clear that this type of rare precious medicine was precious. It was because her status was special that she was able to have one.</span></p>

Shi Hao said with a cold voice, “Are they forcing me to kill their War King?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was angry. The War King’s people continuously chased after him. It was hard for him to break away. He decided to take some risks!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t be too rash,” Yun Xi said. She was extremely worried.</span></p>

I have a chance to take action and kill him!” Shi Hao said. His eyes erupted with light, shooting out like a rainbow.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Xi discovered that this youth had an indescribable type of charm, an unrivaled style. He was self-confident and persistent. There was a type of divine radiance around his entire being.&nbsp;</span></p>

The current Shi Hao was firm and resolute, confident in himself. He was shining brilliantly. Shi Hao was going to kill the War King</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What kind of confidence was this? One has to understand that they were one of the higher realm’s ten greatest clans in the past, the most tyrannical War Emperor Clan. Their War Kings were definitely heaven defying.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Yun Xi looked at him, she stared blankly for a moment, a bit spellbound. Then, she quickly snapped back, her face a bit red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t put yourself in danger!” She advised, worrying for Shi Hao’s safety.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who am I? A heaven warping martial talent. It is just a trifling War King. I must kill him!” Shi Hao was in high spirits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yun Xi was stupefied, feeling that his confidence was a bit narcissistic, as well as a bit familiar. However, she shook her head, and then continued to advise against this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There’s no need to be scared. Watch how I kill him.” Shi Hao had already decided to take the risk. He produced a spiritual body and had this spiritual body bring Yun Xi away and draw the True deity’s attention as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“He is a True deity, so he’ll see through this quickly. He will go back to kill you.” Yun Xi was nervous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t worry. I only need a tiny bit of time. If necessary, show him the Golden Bodhi fruit. He’ll definitely hesitate then and chase for another period of time.” Shi Hao gave the Golden Bodhi fruit to the spiritual body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then, he turned around, resolutely turning around to kill the War King!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three blood moons suspended in the air. Within the depths of the ancient battlefield, demonic gods would roar from time to time. However, the area in front was quite peaceful. The ground was barren, and when one stepped on it, it would feel as if one was stepping on metal or stone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Da, da, da…</span></p>

The blood moons scattered their radiance, making that person appear especially valiant. He directly faced a group of people.&nbsp;</span></p>

His long eyebrows reached his temples, staring out with his phoenix like eyes. His body looked like it was made from precious stones. His entire body had a type of brilliance. He was exceptionally powerful and terrifying.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You think you are worth anything? I returned to kill you!” Shi Hao said softly, but there was an unquestionable pressure as he walked over step by step. Under the blood moons, his tall and straight figure was especially heroic. His eyes were resplendent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The great earth began to tremble along with his footsteps, resonating with him, pulsing with his movements. Blinding holy radiance erupted from his body. It was as if a Great Emperor had descended into this world.</span></p>

I do not need to stand in my ancestor’s shade and will be an Emperor in my own right!” Shi Hao calmly said.&nbsp;</span></p>
