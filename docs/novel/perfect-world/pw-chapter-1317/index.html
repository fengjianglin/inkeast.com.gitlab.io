 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The decorated archway collapsed, giant boulders tumbled down!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The expert seated there stood up, his eyes cold as they stared at Great Elder. How many years has it been since someone dared act this impudent?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What kind of place was this? This was Wang Family, a long life family. Who dared behave atrociously here?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yet today, someone carried a skull and a ruined corpse, throwing them into Wang Family’s decorated archway. This was undisguised provocation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You are extremely strong, but if you want to provoke my Wang Family, you’ve overestimated yourself. You are bringing disaster upon yourself!” That person said. It was a middle-aged man, his figure extremely tall, at the prime of his life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Finally, a person instead of a vicious beast.” Great Elder said. He brought Shi Hao to these ruins.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When one surveyed this place from this position, one could see endless draconic energy rising, every single mountain peak seemingly spiritual. The great mountains all released rich spiritual energy!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was extremely astonishing, any one of these divine peaks extremely precious in the outside world. However, in this place, there were over ten thousand of them, grand and vast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Immortal mist winded about the mountain peaks. With over ten thousand of them together, it could be considered magnificent!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a type of marvel, one couldn’t see the limits through a single glance. Silver waterfalls crashed down, floating islands situated throughout. Auspicious birds and propitious beasts moved about; this was an immortal family’s pure land.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was to the extent where it could be said that this was an immortal land not just in name, but also in reality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was because in Immortal Ancient, this place had produced long life beings, true top level experts who remained imperishable in their lives. This was their immortal dao pure land, existing all the way from ancient times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If those of the outside world wanted to discover this type of pure land, they could only dig up the great earth, cut open the ancient caves left by the ancient people. However, Wang Family’s place here was everlasting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That middle-aged man took action, immediately using a fierce move. He used a heaven-shattering method, sword light like rainbows as they crashed down streak after streak, dazzling and brilliant, wishing to hack Great Elder to death!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In that instant, light beams appeared everywhere in the sky. It was as if an expanse of comets moved through the sky, bombarding the same spot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bo!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When faced with this attack, Great Elder raised his hand, making a wiping motion. All of the sword light became dim like candles in the wind, quickly going out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, he reached out his arm, grabbing this person with a single motion, and then gently clenched his fingers. This extremely powerful cultivator coughed out large mouthfuls of blood on the spot, almost exploding to death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the crucial moment, Great Elder showed mercy, throwing him to the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the back, there were quite a few youngsters who saw this scene, all of them shaken up, their minds pale. Just how frightening was this elder? He subdued a powerful expert with just a raise of his hand!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One had to understand that the middle-aged man was a great mountain in their minds, unmovable. However now, he was taken prisoner so easily; this was just too shocking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Enemy attack!” Someone cried out loudly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In reality, even if they didn’t say anything, those by the mountain gate in the distance long saw what was going on. They blew the bugle horn, the sound long and drawn-out, sending a report inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The decorated archway was nothing more than a point of lookout to be on alert, in front of them the true mountain gate. There was a grand palace that blocked the only road inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This palace was extremely grand, absolutely giant, made of a certain type of metal. Right now, it flickered with silvery-white radiance, shining like the stars in the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Star Palace!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was an important place in Wang Family, a place that always had a powerful individuals overseeing it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Old ancestor, things are bad!” Someone said, feeling sullen. He carried that middle-aged man, as well as Wang Manglong’s ruined corpse and the head of the elder who died at the same time back then, entering the silver Star Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What are you panicking for?!” The elder shouted. Then, his eyes narrowed. “These are people from my clan?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes!” Someone said with a quiet voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">hong</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;noise, the elder stood up, his eyes cold and chilly. He left the silver Star Palace with a single step, looking at Great Elder and Shi Hao in the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who are you all? Daring to kill my Wang Family’s people, it’ll have to be blood that returns blood, you all will pay the price!” The old ancestor said, domineering and decisive, his attitude and conviction unquestionable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ninth Generation Ancestor, that youngster is… Huang!” Someone recognized Shi Hao, because due to various reasons, the clan’s younger generation had all seen his portrait.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao’s name was now extremely well-known. Moreover, he had been viewed as a servant by their clan, forced to go into Origin Ancient Mine to unearth Life Stones, triggering many disturbances, so it was hard for them not to know about him even if they tried.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s him, that insolent youngster?” Wang Family’s Ninth Generation Ancestor’s eyes became cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Correct, he set himself against our Wang Family again and again, not knowing the height and depths of heaven and earth. Old ancestor, please capture him!” Someone said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This so-called Ninth Generation Ancestor was arrogant. Even though his age was already extremely great, he still carried a wave of viciousness, someone who was overly protective of his people, or it could be said that he was an extreme person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn’t care about right or wrong, only knowing about his clan, wouldn’t ask about reasoning. When he heard that Shi Hao had opposed Wang Family, he previously felt that it was beneath him to go out and kill this youngster, but now that he brought himself over to their doors, he naturally wouldn’t show mercy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Just a young person, yet so vicious and merciless, daring to kill my Wang Family’s people. In that case, you can forget about living too!” Wang Family’s Ninth Generation Ancestor said coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why don’t you ask why I killed him?” Shi Hao said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There is no need for me to ask. Even if you have all the reasoning on your side, as long as you dare touch a single finger on my Wang Family’s people, to the extent where you even touch one fine hair, I wouldn’t forgive you!” Wang Family’s Ninth Generation Ancestor said domineeringly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So this is the long life Wang Family? Truly overbearing!” Shi Hao said, inwardly filled with anger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wang Family, you all really are something!” Great Elder’s face also fell. The other party was too brash, dealing with people and not what happened, only asking if his clansmen had suffered, not caring about any other reasoning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What? You all cannot accept this? You can’t do anything about it even if you can’t accept it. Since you dared anger my Wang Family, then you can only pay us back in blood!” Wang Family’s Ninth Generation Ancestor said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While speaking, his fingers were like blades, drawing out a stroke towards Shi Hao. This place rumbled with noise, the blade radiance too terrifying, world-shaking and sharp, powerful to an immeasurable degree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was supreme being blade energy. This Ninth Generation Ancestor was incredibly tyrannical, now almost about to become a true supreme being, only a fine line away!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Someone like him with extremely high status, when dealing with a younger generation like Shi Hao, didn’t show the slightest bit of mercy, to the extent where it could even be called extremely shameless. If this attack landed, Shi Hao was undoubtedly dead!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qiang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Great Elder made his move. A finger pointed out, and then the supreme being blade energy all scattered. Moreover, that finger’s power didn’t decrease at all, instead quickly enlarging.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You…” Wang Family’s Ninth Generation Ancestor was alarmed and flustered, becoming extremely angry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He knew that Great Elder was an expert, but no matter what, he never expected his cultivation to be this great. He already showed enough respect for the other party, thinking that he was about the same level as himself. However, who would have expected that he was far above?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Family’s Ninth Generation Ancestor immediately knew that things were bad. He quickly backed up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, since Great Elder took action, how could it not display its effects? That finger enlarged, as if a heaven supporting pillar descended, smashing down on his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Family’s Ninth Generation Ancestor coughed out large mouthfuls of blood, bones broken, tendons snapped. He released a miserable scream, even his vertebra snapped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was too shocking. They had just met, yet he was already seriously injured and dying!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Forget about you not being a supreme being yet, even if you entered that realm, you still wouldn’t have the qualifications to act insolent before me!” Great Elder said coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The people in the surroundings all blinked their eyes. The so-called peak expert Ninth Generation Ancestor was defeated just like that? They had only just encountered each other! It was just too easy, right? No one dared believe what they were seeing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You… who exactly are you?” Wang Family’s Ninth Generation Ancestor was horrified. He knew that things were extremely troublesome now, that a matchless figure came.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he still wanted to intimidate the other side with Wang Family’s name, saying, “No matter who you are, this is Wang Family. Our long life clan’s dignity will not tolerate blaspheme.:</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Long life family’s dignity… won’t tolerate blaspheme?” Great Elder look at him. When he thought back to this person’s egotistical words, only dealing with people without talking reason, he immediately felt a wave of coldness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wang Family has always stood at the very top, not mingling with mortals below, overlooking all life like ants, now already domineering by habit. Today, I am going to give you all a lesson.” Great Elder spoke coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While speaking, he raised his hand, similarly using finger like a blade, and then he moved it forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ah,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">no!” Wang Family’s Ninth Generation Ancestor screamed out, his eyes full of horror.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This blade destroyed everything below the neck, turning his body into a bloody mist. The head that remained was also shaken up, already cracking, primordial spirit even more so seriously injured!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Peng!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, Great Elder swung out his sleeve. This head directly smashed towards that silver Star Palace!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The palace exploded, turning into countless silver metal pieces, rushing in all directions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This immediately triggered giant waves. Forget about the mountain gate, even the inside of Wang Family was startled. Many figures rushed up into the skies, overlooking this place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was because this affected too much!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That Star Palace was this clan’s gate, the sole entrance into the pure land. It was actually blown up by someone!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One had to understand that throughout the endless years, ever since Immortal Ancient elapsed and this great era started, this type of thing had only happened twice. Both of those times, it triggered tremendous chaos!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now, someone else came, daring to take action like this!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You… who exactly are you?” Someone asked with a trembling voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were many people from Wang Family who rarely left this place, always cultivating in this pure land, so they naturally never met Great Elder. This was especially the case with how profound Great Elder’s cultivation was, normal people not having the opportunity to meet him even when they moved about outside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Have Immortal Wang come out to meet me!” Great Elder shouted, his voice like thunder, rumbling through this place, shaking up the entire ancient immortal dao rite.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they heard these words, everyone’s scalps became numb, trembling inwardly. Who exactly was this? He actually dared call out their great ancestor!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Who was Immortal Wang? He was the direct grandson of the one who achieved immortality back then, as well as Wang Family’s great ancestor. He had remained in seclusion for many years, already tens of thousands of years since he emerged. It was unknown whether he was still alive or not.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An individual who wore a purple-gold crown, body covered in moon white daoist robes directly walked over, his figure flickering about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His aura was too terrifying, as if an immortal descended in this world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, another person walked over from a different direction, white hair like snow, body covered in immortal energy, extremely shocking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, the third figure appeared, dressed in golden daoist robes. He walked over step by step, the sun, moon, and stars appearing below his feet, the scene terrifying!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The situation doesn’t seem right!” The golden little ant was standing on Shi Hao’s shoulder, his neck shrinking back. He felt a headache, his body turning cold. It was because Great Elder called out Immortal Wang, yet so many exceptional experts came out at once!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These individuals’ auras were too terrifying, bathed in immortal splendor. It was as if they already stepped into the long life domain, possessing a type of unequalled might!</span></p>
