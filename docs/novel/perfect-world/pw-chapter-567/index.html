It was an extremely unique race. Their physical forms were all different. Some of them were divine vines, others were great trees and even humanoids or beasts.&nbsp;</span></p>

There were a hundred thousand holy mountains inside. It was a primitive and desolate place.&nbsp;</span></p>

A Firegold Vine formed a human body, and this extraordinary talent swept through everything before him. Even though his age wasn’t that great, he was unstoppably shooting for the top.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Firegold Race, in the present world, wasn’t that great of a sect. However, they produced this type of exceptional character who was divine and powerful, previously undefeated.&nbsp;</span></p>

They felt a sense of admiration towards him, but they were also filled with confusion. The spirit realm corresponded with the real world, so Hundred Thousand Holy Mountain was quite far from this place. How did he travel through all that distance and come here?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Normal cultivators needed several years to cross this distance.&nbsp;</span></p>

It’s actually a vine, a creature from the Firegold Race…” Shi Hao said to himself. He picked up some things from everyone’s discussions, which caused his eyes to reveal a strange light.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are quite strong, exceeding my expectations.” Teng Yi spoke. He was surrounded by a great golden sun, and as he stood in the void, he was imposing and holy. There was the aura of a vine exuding outwards. His figure was like a buddha.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was a Firegold Vine that had long cultivated flesh. His divine sense was so powerful that others could feel it, and a boundless sea of blood energy was stored within, roiling within his body. Once it erupted, it would inevitably shake the world.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Even though his age isn’t great, he has still become one of the Firegold Race’s guardian daoists.”</span></p>

It was quite obvious that he came to suppress Shi Hao and bring him back to protect their mountain gate.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Unbridled!” Shi Hao only had this word for him. This person was holy and extraordinary, but he was extremely arrogant and forceful as well. He actually dared to do this!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Weng!</span></p>

Teng Yi moved, and both hands formed imprints. His left hand formed a divine moon while his right hand formed a great sun, and they both suppressed downwards.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, light erupted endlessly, filling this world with brilliance!</span></p>

It was unknown which race it was that established it, but the creatures that truly understood its profound mysteries were exceeding few in the present world.</span></p>

Everyone was shivering in fear, finding it hard to speak. They felt as if a suffocating and mountainous pressure was crushing down on them.&nbsp;</span></p>
