Exceptional talents fought against each other. As soon as they encountered each other, no one was willing submit to the other, and only a battle could decide things. The battles were especially fierce!</span></p>

He saw even more powerful creatures. Now that news of the three world copper coffin and Supreme Hall sounded, it created a huge sensation. Powerful individuals came from every area.&nbsp;</span></p>

An enormous earthworm appeared. It was more than fifty zhang in length. This was an expert that had its divine flame ignited. As soon as it appeared, it directly attacked Immortal Palace’s young great one.&nbsp;</span></p>

It only desired that void halberd, and that was why it mounted a sneak attack.&nbsp;</span></p>

It coiled about in the sky, leaving behind blue symbols. Then, it quickly rushed towards the great earth. With the assassination resulting in failure, it didn’t want to stay behind any longer.&nbsp;</span></p>

This was an expert from Heaven Mending Sect that had ignited his divine flame. He also arrived in this region.&nbsp;</span></p>

He brought out a divine bead that radiated earthen yellow radiance. It surrounded the mountain forest below, making the earthworm’s body go rigid, unable to escape.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the difference between a loose cultivator and that of a holy land. The former lacked formidable precious artifacts, while it was different for the latter. They had weapons that could completely suppress experts at the same level.</span></p>

It immediately made the earthworm lose its method of mobility.&nbsp;</span></p>

Immortal Palace’s disciple appeared. His long hair scattered down behind him. His body was slender and sturdy. Dazzling radiance exuded from him. The void halberd in his hands hacked down.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pu!</span></p>

The halberd hacked the earthworm into two, and then with a fierce twist, it made the powerful creature break apart inch by inch, turning into a bloody mist. An expert that had its divine flame lit was killed just like that!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blood splashed everywhere, making the great void halberd appear extremely sinister. Those that saw this scene on the mountain range all shivered inwardly. A creature that ignited its divine flame was killed just like that.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soon after, a few other powerful creatures appeared in this region. They were all powerful figures from various sects.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It is becoming more and more lively. I should leave.” Shi Hao said softly. There was no reason for him to tread in muddy waters. While speaking, he gave Silver a glance. It was enough as long as he brought it along.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This region became more and more chaotic. After information about the three world copper coffin and Supreme Hall were released, it triggered a huge sensation. Important figures from different sects all couldn’t sit still.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before leaving, Shi Hao paid Python Village a hundred li out a visit. He saw the few vicious individuals third grandfather had mentioned and secretly assassinated them, helping Vermilion Village deal with some grudges.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I need to leap out of the sea like a fish and no longer be restricted. I want to move freely through this world without hiding from anyone!” Shi Hao said to himself. He needed to become more powerful and not like how he was right now, feeling such restraining fear.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was going to pursue power and strengthen himself. He temporarily left this chaos.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Either way, Silver was right at his side. He knew that a great natural opportunity would naturally rest in this Silver Phoenix’s body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Two days later, Shi Hao and Silver disappeared. When they were about to leave Scholar Tree City, he suddenly felt as if something wasn’t right. There were mists curling about ahead that were quite strange.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was extremely careful, wishing to go around it. However, in the end, he found that the entire place was like this. This was a great sealing formation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Silver was extremely nervous. A pair of large eyes that flowed with dark radiance moved about. However, it didn’t say anything, obediently staying by his side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What a huge expenditure, to directly seal up this region.” Shi Hao sighed in admiration. It was clear that a great sect’s expert hurried here and sealed up this place in order to capture the silver haired woman.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He woke up the divine striking stone. The two of them researched it together and found a route out. Two days later, a ripple appeared in the foggy area, and they silently left.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao glanced backwards. That was a ‘swamp’. There would definitely be great battles between many cultivators.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Silver, do you know where the three world copper coffin is? How about you tell me where Supreme Hall is?” When they were far away, Shi Hao suddenly spoke.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Silver's feathers immediately stood on end one after another. It stared at him with its large eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Don’t be so tense. I’m just casually asking.” Shi Hao smiled and said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soon after, he arrived in the prefectural city. He discovered that the battle between this level of geniuses hadn't began yet and that there was still a period of time before then.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We should still change to another prefectural city to be a bit safer.” Shi Hao said to himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After travelling several tens of thousands of li, he departed far from that region, and only then did he stop. He sected an enormous city and entered, taking residence. The main reason for his decision was to learn a bit more about the current situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was because Vermilion Village was too remote, and even third grandfather, a senior who had left to cultivate before only had limited knowledge of the outside world.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is the Lightning Province, and it is actually close to Five Elements Province!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he received this information, Shi Hao found it hard to calm down. Apart from cultivation, there was one other important thing he wanted to do, and that was to search for his grandfather.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Five Elements Province was where Immortal Mountain was located!</span></p>
