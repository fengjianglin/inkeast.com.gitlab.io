There were all types of precious materials, spiritual medicines and other things, so much of them that they could be piled up into a small mountain. They released brilliant multicolored light, making it so bright here that it was hard to look straight at.</span></p>

Great waves were stirring within his heart, so there was even less of a need to talk about the youngsters. There were just too many precious objects, enough for one to feel excited with just a single look.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Stone Country couldn’t be considered inferior, as it was an ancient divine country. However, when they were compared to Heaven Mending Sect and Western Sect, it truly dimmed in comparison!</span></p>

When a bowl of water was added, the liquid would waft out fragrance. It was unknown just how many precious medicines it had refined.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao also noticed this cauldron. It was obtained from Heaven Mending Sect. It was ashy brown in color, looking like it was carved from a piece of rock. There were astonishing symbols inside. This was an extremely rare find.</span></p>

He decided to give this cauldron to Stone Village, using it to make up for their losses. He broke two of the village’s ancestral artifacts. They were now in terrible shape after his fight with Immortal Palace’s old servant.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then, Shi Hao picked up a bone sword, a rattan staff, as well as a fist-sized precious furnace that was entirely red in color. They were all swirling with divine patterns, powerful and mysterious. They were the best items out of the ancient divine level magical artifacts.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao handed them to Qinfeng, having him bring them back to Stone Village to protect the villagers.&nbsp;</span></p>

The two great sects were defeated by Shi Hao, and the rewards were extremely great. There were a few extremely formidable ancient magical artifacts on the boat that would be left for Stone Country.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What abundant spoils! I really never expected the spoils to be so great!” The Peng King sighed in admiration. Even though he was a supreme expert, he still found it hard to calm down.&nbsp;</span></p>

They all radiated precious splendor and flowed with brilliant colors. They were extremely formidable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao nodded. He was going to the higher realms, so he indeed needed a powerful magical artifact to protect himself. As for Stone Country’s sect protecting precious artifacts, he didn’t plan on taking them with him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He looked them over again and again. Several old kings accompanied him, introducing these magical artifacts’ origins and uses. After breaking through the two holy lands, they understood a few things from the captives.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao swept his eyes over them. He felt as if they didn’t really suit him. In the end, he pointed at a divine pool with sparkling vajra fluid in it that radiated a fantastic fragrance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then just this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a raise of his hand, he summoned the demonfall precious pestle from inside of the pool. This item was extremely mysterious, refined from the beast bone of an unknown creature. It was entirely dull without any luster.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, everyone knew that this was an ancient magical artifact that was extremely unordinary. It definitely came from the hands of a deity.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When it entered his hands, Shi Hao immediately felt some weight. This precious pestle was only a foot in length, but it was several thousand jin in weight. Its material was special and strange after all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He lightly brandished this demonfall pestle that was refined from white bone about. Symbols immediately appeared, and there were astonishing fluctuations. A great mountain in front of him collapsed in a flash.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How powerful! This weapon isn’t bad.” The War King nodded.</span></p>

They were overjoyed as they brought over an ancient scroll.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“golden body elixir’s recipe?!” The Ming King’s breathing became rushed.&nbsp;</span></p>

Since ancient times, only core disciples like Yue Chan could take it in and soak in it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Stone Country cared a lot about this recipe. They had always been searching for it. At this moment, they found it among the pile of treasures.&nbsp;</span></p>

If it was used to refine the body, as long as one obtained enough divine liquid, they would obtain twice the results with half the effort. One’s constitution would be raised to its peak.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back then, the dual-pupiled Shi Yi was able to possess sturdy flesh due to receiving large amounts of golden body elixir. It wasn’t inferior to the precious body Shi Hao refined himself at all.&nbsp;</span></p>

There is only the upper half, missing the lower half. We can only use it as a reference.” Shi Hao carefully looked it over after receiving it. He regretfully shook his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The complete ancient recipe disappeared from the lower realm together with the death of that Heaven Mending Sect supreme expert.&nbsp;</span></p>

There was a restriction within his sea of consciousness, which, once attacked, would self-destruct.&nbsp;</span></p>

Being able to obtain an ancient recipe could already be considered quite lucky, enough to make Stone Race become more powerful. Wishing to obtain everything was quite impractical.&nbsp;</span></p>

This raised a huge uproar. Stone Country travelled to other regions to carry out battles and returned victorious. The entire world was in commotion.&nbsp;</span></p>

Little Western Paradise was located inside of a small world. Right now, it had its entrance sealed, so it was completely isolated from the outside world.</span></p>

As for the others, they were all left stupefied. This weapon was definitely not ordinary. It could be considered a top item even among true deity level magical artifacts.&nbsp;</span></p>

Soon after, he was angered, because he noticed a few vicious disciples. They were well known plunderers in the wasteland region. When he saw them, he immediately thought of the group of bandits that wreaked havoc in the great wastelands.&nbsp;</span></p>

Regardless of whether it was from how they treated Stone Country or how they previously slaughtered those small tribes in the great wastelands, their conducts were incredibly vile. They needed to be punished and wiped out.&nbsp;</span></p>

Inside were medicinal herbs like li fire spiritual flower, vermilion orchid, scarlet light grass, and others. There was also a swamp that nurtured Spiritblood Dragons, Scarlet Heaven Centipedes, Three-Footed Frogs and other spiritual creatures.&nbsp;</span></p>

As a result, Stone Country rose up in power. When news of this reached the rest of the world, everyone was trembling in shock!</span></p>

He went into isolation to refine medicine. Before leaving, he had a few more things to do.&nbsp;</span></p>

All types of spiritual herbs were gathered, and quite a few rare mineral ores were brought into the palace. Apart from this, spiritual bugs and other things had been prepared.&nbsp;</span></p>

There were quite a few that were handed over to Qingfeng to bring back to Stone Village. There was also a batch left for Stone Country.&nbsp;</span></p>

He stretched out his body, stopping his medicine refinement.&nbsp;</span></p>

However, when they opened their mouths, they didn’t know what to say. Shi Hao was going to leave for the higher realms and find a heavenly path. He was going to seek his own dao, so no one could stop him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your Majesty!” The old kings all felt emotional. Since Shi Hao rose to power, to his death, and then to his revival, too many things had happened. It was hard to forget.&nbsp;</span></p>

This separation might be eternal. They might never see each other again.&nbsp;</span></p>

There will only be sadness. I should just leave like this,” said Shi Hao.&nbsp;</span></p>

They were all filled with reluctance. A few individuals’ eyes carried tears.&nbsp;</span></p>

They felt extremely reluctant. Shi Hao had brought them with him to break into those holy lands. They swept through everything before them and flattened the world, making their hearts experience great emotions. They were filled with respect and admiration.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Goodbye!” Shi Hao turned around and then took large steps into the distance.&nbsp;</span></p>

He called out in a loud voice, “You have to take care of yourself… Village chief, uncles, and our childhood companions are all unwilling to part with you! Will we be able to meet again in this life?”</span></p>

His eyes became blurry, and his nose became sore, but he still didn’t turn around. Then, he disappeared.&nbsp;</span></p>
