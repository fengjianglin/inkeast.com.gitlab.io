 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao and Cao Yusheng walked forward, entering Jadefall Lake along a river, stepping on a small boat. Ripples spread outwards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the lake’s surroundings, there were many spiritual mountains. It was magnificent and beautiful, white mist swirling about them. Iris and orchids grew, full of spirituality, as if an ancient immortal mountain was located here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were some others who also entered Jadefall Lake, because it was almost time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">During this period of time, a few war chariots and divine beasts appeared one after another, bringing young geniuses here. More and more people came for this great gathering of young kings from different clans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">, there is heaven shocking news, there really might be people from the restricted region here! I seem to have seen people enter Imperial Pass, I wonder if they came after receiving the invitation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Someone passed along this piece of information, triggering a huge commotion. Everyone became shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There really were creatures who left the restricted region, arriving in Imperial Pass? Just how earth-shattering was this? From the past until now, not many people had seen them before, no one knowing what they were really like.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In that instant, this became the focal point of the discussions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many people were excited. If even creatures from the Nine Heavens’ restricted region came, then that really would be an unprecedented distinguished meeting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right at this time, waves of light surged from Jadefall Lake, rushing into the heavens. A sparkling green island emerged, surrounded by a curtain of light, preventing water from entering the island even when it was at the bottom of the lake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was an island in Jadefall Lake, now appearing!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For cultivators, islands floating in the sky or hidden beneath water weren’t all that shocking. However, this island was a bit strange, suspected to be the remains of a True Immortal, an immortal previously residing here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was because now, they already couldn’t find any cave dwellings, only some debris and verdant plant life remaining. However, it was still extremely captivating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was because strand after strand of immortal energy was released precisely from this island. It was rumored that even a piece of normal metal, when fiddled with by a True Immortal, could also be turned into treasure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was why because a True Immortal resided here, even if there wasn’t anything left behind, there would still be an immortal aura pervading this place!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was now time, the gathering of geniuses began.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone got onto this island one after another. Without a doubt, the Five Spirits War Chariot attracted great attention. There was immediately a large group of people who circled over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, Little Sky King, Great Xu Tuo, Tuogu Yulong and others also became the focal point of attention, surrounded by many people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for Wei Family’s Four Phoenixes, there was even less of a need to say anything. Beautiful female cultivators were far more popular than men. There was a group of young heroes who converged here, enthusiastically calling out to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There really are a lot of people…” The Heavenly Horned Ant said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huh?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It’s you?!” When a cultivator saw the Heavenly Horned Ant, his face immediately became pale.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was precisely the one who delivered the message, he still remembered how terrifying this little ant’s way of talking was, even calling Immortal Wang a kid. If it really said something that crossed the line here, then it really would be beyond terrible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ah,</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;you came too, unlucky!” Just as he backed up, he saw Cao Yusheng, veins popping on his forehead. He turned around and immediately left, because he had been beaten up by Fatty Cao three days ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jadefall Island was extremely beautiful, the green grass like a cushion, beautiful trees verdant and lush. Divine springs surged, wondrous medicines releasing multicolored light, medicinal fragrance assailing the nostrils, leaving one intoxicated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What are you all in a fluster for, you ran into me!” A youngster berated that ‘messenger’.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m sorry, just now…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Just now what?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“People who didn’t receive invitations also came.” The messenger said. When he said this, he gave Fatty Cao a look.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who dares? Are you trying to make a disturbance in this distinguished gathering?” The purple-haired young man in charge of maintaining order immediately took large steps towards Cao Yusheng. When he arrived before him, he shouted, “You… leave, immediately!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cao Yusheng gave him a look of disdain, saying, “Are you looking for a beating? You dare holler at an esteemed guest? Open your dog eyes and take a look, what is this?” While speaking, he waved the invitation in his hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The one who came became suspicious, giving the messenger a look.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Apologize to this old one. So what if I don’t have an invitation? Can’t you be a bit more polite? Apologize.” Cao Yusheng said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He really doesn’t have an invitation, that is someone else’s!” The messenger said from not far away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Did you steal someone else’s invitation?” The purple-haired young man who maintained order raised his voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the surroundings, there were immediately quite some people who turned around, because the disturbance here became a bit bigger. Many people were shocked. There was actually someone who dared stir up trouble here?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I didn’t steal someone else’s, it’s my friend’s.” Cao Yusheng said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Doesn’t matter, even if your friend didn’t come, he still can’t hand it to you. If you don’t have an invitation, then you cannot ascend the island.” The purple-haired youth was extremely strict, finding Cao Yusheng unsightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is that so? However, I saw that after Jin Zhan and Wang Xi arrived, there were others from Jin Family and Wang Family who came. I refuse to believe that one clan will receive two invitations.” Cao Yusheng revealed a cold smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he came, he saw that Jin Zhan’s little uncle Jin Zhifei came, as well as another older cousin of Wang Xi’s who came!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You…” The purple-haired youth was a bit annoyed, because there were indeed quite a few people who came with a familiar person, moreover not just a few of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Right, that old man, age already great, what young genius? You didn’t chase him away, yet instead came to make noise here.” Cao Yusheng pointed at Jin Zhifei, someone who had fought with Shi Hao not too long ago, the Jin Family expert who had his mount seized. He then said, “Do you not know that I am the number two supreme being of the present world younger generation? The one who will bury me is number one, while I am number two!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While looking at his chattering appearance, the purple-haired youth laughed coldly and said, “Regardless, you are no good, cannot enter. You don’t have the qualification!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why can they enter?” Cao Yusheng pointed at Wang Family and Jin Family’s people, as well as some other people who didn’t have invitations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Can you compare to them? They are the heaven’s pride of long life families, the people they were brought by are enough to be sovereigns under the sky!” The purple-haired youngster ridiculed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was clear that the disturbance here was now great. This place became quiet, many people looking over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s… Fatty Cao!” Someone said quietly. There were cultivators from the Nine Heavens above who recognized him, knowing that he was close to Shi Hao. They felt like now that this fatty was provoked, Huang would definitely make an appearance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What qualification is needed?” Right at this time, Shi Hao walked over from the back, looking at the purple-haired young man in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this time, a few people recognized him, for example, Great Xu Tuo, Exiled Immortal, protectors’ descendant Dugu Yun, Qi Gu, and others. They were all people who were familiar with him, right now nodding in his direction, sending their greetings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who are you?” The purple-haired youth asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The messenger hurriedly rushed up, saying a few sentences quietly into his ear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The purple-haired youth immediately widened his eyes, sucking in a cold breath of air. This was actually Huang, he was now personally dealing with him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There was some misunderstanding. Since Brother Shi came, then you can naturally bring a friend or two.” His revealed an awkward expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who really is that person?” Someone asked, feeling extremely dissatisfied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right at this time, a disturbance swept out. The owner of the Five Spirits War Chariot Qi Hong walked over. From far away, he said with a smile on his face, “Is this Brother Shi? I have been looking forward to meeting you for quite some time. To be able to meet now, it truly is a pleasure, a pleasure!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone was shocked. The inheritor of an unmatched being, Qi Hong, actually personally greeted this person, so polite to this delicate and handsome youth. It really left everyone shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not long ago, a group of people were welcoming Qi Hong, surrounding him, but now, he actually went to greet another.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Turns out you are Huang. We met along the way! Your appearance is so delicate and pretty, but your battle accomplishments are so incredible. In our imaginations, we thought that you would have three heads six arms, leopard head and looped eyes.” Wei Family’s Four Phoenixes walked over, a young lady among them giggling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone was alarmed. Even the four genius young ladies came over to greet that young man, trying to gain his friendship, being this polite. Who exactly was he?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Haha,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huang, someone who rose up through a single battle, killing ten foreign kings in Great Scarlet Sky Border, shocking the world under the sky, we finally meet today.” Long life family’s Tuogu Yulong walked over, his head of purple head scattering down, divine might surging as he walked over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even he came over, this naturally made everyone’s minds tremble, faces pale.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, everyone finally knew who the one who came was. Tuogu Yulong spoke his name, it was Huang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shi Hao was surprised, not expecting these people to take the initiative to welcome him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Long life Wei Family’s Four Phoenixes were one thing, after all, there was no conflict of interests, but Qi Hong who owned the Five Spirits War Chariot clearly invited Jin Zhan to ride with him, while Tuogu Yulong’s sister accompanied Wang Xi, quite close to each other, so why did they treat him with such courtesy now?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This place erupted with noise. The cultivators from the Nine Heavens naturally recognized Shi Hao, but many creatures in Imperial Pass had never met him before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now, they finally understood, seeing this person for themselves. All of their eyes burned, feeling shock and excitement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Heavens, he is that Huang! I came together with him, wasn’t that far away. I never expected to have traveled most of the trip with him!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brother Shi, this one truly feels great admiration for you! In Great Scarlet Sky’s battle, you brought great glory to our side through slaughter, making everyone release a pent-up wave of resentment! I had always heard about you, but never met you, it truly is a fortunate encounter today!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Large amounts of people surrounded over, so crammed not a drop of water could trickle through. It was extremely noisy. There were even more so some young ladies whose eyes burned with passion, staring at Shi Hao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Imperial Pass was located at the very front of this realm, constantly facing the threat of the other side. No one understood how terrifying the creatures of that side were than them. Continuously killing ten kings, for them, it was simply a legend!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This place erupted with noise, many cultivators surrounding over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, not everyone called out so enthusiastically, for example, Jin Zhan sat there, not moving the entire time, or Wang Xi, her white clothes purer than snow, extremely cold, never giving Shi Hao a look.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were some others, for example, Six Crown King Ning Chuan and others who didn’t say anything.</span></p>

 <p>Hi everyone,</p>
 <p>I disappeared for a few days without updating you all, and this is 100% my fault. There are some excuses for this, but they are still excuses in the end. I also feel like I'm constantly apologizing to you guys, and the more I apologize, the less it means, but nevertheless, I still have to explain what happened.</p>
 <p>Between a mixture of packing, flying, and then getting sick subsequently, it put me in a state where I was physically and mentally unable to translate for a bit, and so I was in bed during most of that time, just trying to recover. I am feeling much better now, so the chapters are resuming, but I definitely could have updated all of you instead of leaving you in the dark.</p>
 <p>I hope all of you can understand, and I will put in more effort to communicate better going forwards.</p>
