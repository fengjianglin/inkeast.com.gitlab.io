There were a few powerful existences that were trying to cross realms, yet in the end, they were all pierced by that soft green branch one after another and skewered together.&nbsp;</span></p>

He could clearly feel that these creatures were especially powerful, yet after just a single strike, they were nailed into the void by the Willow Deity.</span></p>

There was a golden giant who stirred on a war chariot while carrying a battle-ax in its hand. It was like a divine king that patrolled the heavens as it swooped downwards to chop off that branch.&nbsp;</span></p>

Blood red lightning erupted in the skies and dark clouds roiled. Yin energy descended and covered the world.&nbsp;</span></p>

Was it going to descend into the lower realm as well? The ones descending became increasingly terrifying and numerous. This wasn't some good thing. The great battle in a few days would be even more difficult.&nbsp;</span></p>

Yang energy flourished intensely and exploded inside of those dark clouds.&nbsp;</span></p>

The golden branch collided with a palm that was swirling with primal chaos, resulting in incomparably powerful energy fluctuations.&nbsp;</span></p>

They all backed up in retreat. Those that were unable to retreat in time were struck by the golden lightning and blasted into light that disappeared into the sky.&nbsp;</span></p>

Its great life force and yang energy were mixed together. There was also lightning that erupted with dazzling light and purifying power.&nbsp;</span></p>

It was full of unwillingness, but after more than ten drops of resplendent silver blood descended, it ultimately backed off.&nbsp;</span></p>

The short battle just now was over in a flash, so fast that it was hard to even react to. It was extremely intense, and this was just a probing test from those giants.&nbsp;</span></p>

Heroic spirits might have covered the sky and the cries of ghosts and gods would have filled this world.&nbsp;</span></p>

This was a battle of giants crossing realms.&nbsp;</span></p>

A new giant had entered the mix. When the final moment arrived, will the Willow Deity be able to deal with it all?</span></p>

There are grudges and grievances between these people too. They will be on guard against each other when searching for natural luck down here as well.” The Willow Deity wasn’t worried.&nbsp;</span></p>

Even the little pagoda was involved, so it wasn’t that surprising that they were going to work together with the undying existence.&nbsp;</span></p>

This time, the Willow Deity might erupt with great divine might, because someone from the higher realms wiped out its divine country.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The primordial gate is extremely mysterious, and once one enters it, only blood would flow out. This time, I will satisfy it and toss one or two people in first to test things out.” The Willow Deity said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Its calm words didn’t carry the slightest ripple of emotion, but a terrifying streak of thunder and lightning erupted in the heavens. It was as if there was some type of reaction from the nine heavens down to the underworld!</span></p>

The Willow Deity was trying to test karma, his actions were going to shake the heavens above and earth below. Was it trying to offer sacrifice to the primordial gate? Disaster was going to be brought upon some people!</span></p>

There were too many things he was unwilling to leave behind in the lower realm, and there were still many things he didn’t do yet. He didn’t want to leave immediately.&nbsp;</span></p>

Does that mean that there will be no longer a chance to go up?” Shi Hao asked.&nbsp;</span></p>

There are still several ways one can ascend. I reckon that it won’t be too great of a problem for you. However, if those from the higher realms want to come down, it will be near impossible,” the little pagoda said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Shi Hao heard this, he carefully asked it for guidance.&nbsp;</span></p>

He wanted to straighten out all types of terrible messes, for example, he had to find an inheritor for Stone Country and give Stone Village an explanation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dark clouds in the heavens scattered and the heavenly sun hung in the sky again. Clear clouds covered the skies. This world was once again rich with yang energy. It was as if nothing had happened just now.&nbsp;</span></p>

The two pieces could be joined up together. They were unexpectedly made of the same materials as the True Primordial Record, but it was unfortunately still missing one final piece.&nbsp;</span></p>

The reasoning lies here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao had asked before that since the True Primordial Record was something even the giants in the higher realms were interested in with some of them even cultivating the first piece Divine Guidance, why was he only able to experience some ‘simple to miraculous’ type of power and not the extraordinary divine might he had imagined. Back then, the Willow Deity had said that there might be a day when he might be able to experience it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“For the True Primordial Record’s Divine Guidance, apart from the piece you obtained, there is another Ten Thousand Spirit Diagram, and it rests upon this broken heavenly bone.” Willow Deity explained.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In reality, the first piece was already enough. For characters like those sect masters, they could &nbsp;comprehend the rest by inferring the rest and fully understand the true profoundness. Meanwhile, Shi Hao’s talent was extraordinary, but in the end, his cultivation realm was still too low, and as such, he could not clearly understand everything. This was also part of the reason why he was able to comprehend so much each time he studied something.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ten Thousand Spirit Diagram?” Shi Hao became extremely hopeful.&nbsp;</span></p>

This was true especially for the mysterious region where heavenly soldiers descended in the tens of thousands.&nbsp;</span></p>

Shi Hao’s expression was a bit strange. Fairy Yue Chan was even included in the people present. If he met her, would she make a move against him? The witch was surprisingly going to be there as well.&nbsp;</span></p>

He had cultivated in Heaven Mending Pavilion in the past, but he watched helplessly as it was destroyed. It was something that he found hard to forget to this day.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He still remembered the old ancestor Mu Yan that taught him lightning techniques, Zhuo Yun, Xiong Fei and the other elders that were always angry at him, as well as many other senior brothers and sisters who had lively faces. During the final battle, for the sake of protecting their younger junior brothers and sisters, blood flowed continuously. They were unwilling to back down, and as a result died in the ruins of the Heaven Mending Pavilion.&nbsp;</span></p>
