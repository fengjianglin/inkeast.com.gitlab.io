His right shoulder began to split open, the cracks extending down towards his chest. Blood surged frantically, and half of his body was almost torn apart. He endured the intense pain, operating bone texts to treat himself, guiding the tribulations crossing golden liquid’s immortal pond’s spiritual essence into his body to recover his injuries.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His chest healed, not blasting apart. However, his right arm and shoulder fell off, unable to escape the disaster. Blood dyed the pool red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao’s face was snow white. His teeth were tightly clenched. He picked up his arm and connected the bones himself, guiding the immortal pool’s essence to recombine the broken limb, recovering from this extremely serious injury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He already lost track of how many times this had happened. His torso was cracked apart, blood dyeing the immortal pool red. His entire body suffered a torment from the underworld. He was like a patched up living corpse.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it was anywhere else, even if it was Shi Hao, he still couldn’t tolerate it. It was because his flesh shell had been blasted through several dozen times, seriously injuring his body’s source and dao foundation. Fortunately, this place was within the lake where the Tribulation crossing divine lotus was planted. The golden life substance could recreate blood and flesh on white bones, allowing a person on the verge of death to recover.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao refined the golden bodhi fruit here. His decision was correct. Otherwise, it would have been too dangerous to try this anywhere else. Even if his blood and qi were like those of a dragon, he would still suffer a disaster and die.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There is much less of the fruit remaining now, already one-seventh remaining. I am about to succeed!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What was supporting his willpower right now was the fact that he wasn’t far from completely refining the golden bodhi fruit. He could already see the glimmer of hope at the end of the tunnel, even though he was suffering in torment with blood everywhere, feeling like he would rather die than stay alive. This was perhaps the final darkness before dawn.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao took a deep breath. After adjusting his body’s state, he could clearly see that the immortal pool’s golden liquid was quickly gathering over, entering his body to repair his body’s cracks, continuously nourishing his broken bones. This was a miracle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was because the broken bones recombined and his limbs regrew. The serious injuries from before were healing, approaching completeness at lightning speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the Tribulation crossing divine lotus, exactly the same as the effects of legend, allowing white bones to display vitality, reproducing flesh. This was the fruit that made Heavenly deities go mad over them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Soon after, Shi Hao opened his eyes. When he opened and closed his eyes, there were symbols interweaving. It was as if an expanse of stars were contained within his pupils. There was new life, reprieve from death.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I should get this over with!”</span></p>

Beams of light seeped out strand after strand, winding about his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The small world had dao patterns and formations surrounding this place. The divine senses of individuals could not pry through, and as such, even if one wasn’t that far away, they still wouldn’t be able to sense anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other side of where the Tribulation crossing divine lotus was planted, there was a beauty whose divine senses were astonishing. Her pupils were like gemstones, sparkling and full of life. She unexpectedly sensed some abnormalities.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The lake was warm and sparkling. Yue Chan’s figure was wonderful, her spotlessly white body glowing like ivory without the slightest flaw. Her pupils flickered about, producing a streak of ripples towards that direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, she was acting carefully as well, not taking the risk to approach. It was because she was only feeling doubt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under the interweaving lunar splendor, she was exceptionally beautiful. Her fine black hair scattered down, her intelligent pupils flickering with divine light. Her body looked like it was made of fine jade, snow white and satiny, flowing with specks of brilliance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She began to quietly close in!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In Shi Hao’s hands, there was only an extremely small piece of flesh left sticking to the fruit’s core. It released blazing radiance, and the natural laws could vaguely be seen. Divine ripples interweaved within the flesh.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, the fruit core was the size of a luan egg. It was dark green in color and had a type of demonic attribute. Holding it would make one’s heart palpitate. The dark green radiance made Shi Hao’s palm become translucent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a resolute heart, Shi Hao opened his mouth and nibbled down. The final piece of flesh turned into a wave of blazing radiance. It frantically rushed into his body, once again hacking at his vitality, making him look like a wild horse out of control.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was only the dark green fruit core left in his hand!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao released a groan. His body swayed. This time, his chest bone exploded, and his heart released a cracking sound. This was extremely severe, injuring him severely.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bo!&nbsp;</span></p>

A divine chain of order passed through there, making his body clear from front to back. In addition, they began to extend outwards with him at the center.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that instant, many cracks appeared on his chest. It was as if the smooth level of the earth’s crust split apart and magma surged outwards. Deep gorges appeared streak after streak, filled with blazing radiance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was as if he was going to completely explode! Shi Hao was equivalent to half destroyed!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It hurts so much!” Shi Hao’s mouth opened up a crack, his delicate and pretty face distorting. He fell into the pool of water, turning about and struggling. His injuries were just too severe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The holy radiance jumped about. His chest began to collapse, turning into an expanse of flames that seemed like it was going to burn him into ashes. Sparkling white bones were revealed there. It was dangerous to the extreme.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Reincarnation!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shi Hao roared. His body became covered in divine light. Bone texts shone brilliantly like a phoenix bathed in flames. A coat of divine radiance surrounded his body to support his chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He used his most profound precious technique to deal with the golden bodhi fruit’s corrosion, neutralizing the dangers of his flesh’s collapse.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those natural laws barged in. Shi Hao’s chest split open, healed, his bones broke, and then they joined back up. The reincarnation repeated again and again, entering a stalemate situation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the most dangerous instance. In that short period of time, Shi Hao’s chest shone, and cracks began to extent out towards every part of his body. His entire body was about to be torn apart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reincarnation force could not only kill opponents, it could also affect time. Right now, it was as if it could make the flow of time go in reverse, allowing Shi Hao to regain new life, struggling and resisting the damage.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, the price was tremendous as well. His flesh’s spiritual essence was starting to dry up as well, and his potential was completely displayed. He was gambling with his life, hoping to cross this ‘threshold’.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was, for him, a great tribulation in his life, as well as a great gamble. If he couldn’t make it through, his body and dao would vanish, eternally unrecoverable.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that instant, Shi Hao’s flesh collapsed no less than ten times. He used all types of methods to resist. Bone texts shone, and his flesh’s rupturing stopped before continuing again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After a long time had passed, Shi Hao laid there with his face towards the sky. Blood dyed the water surface. His flesh was tattered, and who knew how many bones were broken. He didn’t move at all, tired to the extreme.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The only fortunate thing was that he made it through!</span></p>
