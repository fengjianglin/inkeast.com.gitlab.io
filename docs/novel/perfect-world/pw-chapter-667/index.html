The two directly erupted into an intense battle, and he didn’t back off!”</span></p>

Everyone was discussing this matter. These news were extremely astonishing, stirring up all of the experts’ emotions. They were all extremely excited for the result.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From their perspective, the young devil king was a new rising force that was too ferocious. He advanced forward valiantly, each battle more shocking than the last. What was his limit?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If one said he could fight against exceptional talents and contend against the greatest individuals among his peers, perhaps even winning, everyone could still understand this. After all, there was more than one exceptional talent, so perhaps he was an ancient sect’s divine child that secretly entered and that was why he could have such glorious battle achievements.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However now, he was fighting a great battle against Immortal Palace’s young great one. This was definitely not normal!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Among the young experts that they knew about, that was definitely the one at the very top who could defeat all opponents and overlook his peers. He was not someone anyone could face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was why when these news spread, it triggered a huge sensation. Many people were left stupefied.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Could it be that one of the ancient inheritance’s hidden geniuses emerged?” An elder said softly. His expression became grave, because there had always been such rumors.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This should be how it is. I heard that there is also a youth that holds a golden lamp. Perhaps he also came from this type of place.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A few others came to this conclusion, believing that they were quite close to the truth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Otherwise, it would be too hard to explain. This young devil appeared too abruptly. They had never heard of him in the past, and only the few hidden geniuses could be like this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By now, the outside world’s endless cultivators were all extremely excited and stirred up from their discussions. If their speculations were true, then there was definitely going to be an incomparably great battle!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sect masters sat in the void, also discussing quietly among themselves. As they talked, their expressions were all extremely serious. They were cautious no matter which legendary ancient inheritance was brought up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Actually, I am hoping that he is a loose cultivator. That way, he would be breaking an undefeated legend.” A sect master said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Shi Hao was as a loose cultivator and not from any ancient inheritances, it would definitely create even more of an uproar. Many great sects might hurry over to fight over him to become their disciple.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I am hoping that it is a ‘wild’ outsider,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">hehe…</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">” An old sect master roared with laughter. His eyes flickered with radiance. His expression was abnormal. He really wanted to accept this kind of disciple.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he also knew that it he was a loose cultivator without any inheritance, he likely wouldn’t have the chance to take him as a disciple, because too many formidable ancient inheritances would be fighting over him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, if everyone knew Shi Hao’s true identity, many people would likely be stupefied, and not many people would dare to offer their protection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was because he had previously overturned a few undying inheritances in the lower realm, even killing the seven deities the higher realm giants sent down into the lower realm, ruining their great plans.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right at that moment, a hazy figure appeared. Someone else had unexpectedly been killed, appearing here.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I will killed by the shockwaves of those two’s intense battle…” He was indescribably ashamed and resentful. This was what he said in a soft voice when he was asked. He came from one of Five Elements Province’s great sects and wasn’t an exceptional talent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this was still shocking enough. Regardless of whether it was Immortal Mountain or Fire Devil Palace, they were all formidable inheritances. The disciples they selected weren’t weak.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He brought back a piece of information, and it was that Immortal Palace’s young great one hadn’t used his sea of magical force yet, only fighting against that individual in a contest of the flesh. That was why life and death hadn’t been decided yet even after several dozen strikes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So that was what happened. Immortal Palace’s secret techniques are world shaking, being well known for their magical power. He didn’t play his trump cards yet!” An elder sighed and said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this was still enough to leave others shocked. The young devil king’s flesh was comparable to Immortal Palace inheritor’s! How shocking of a thing was this?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was because the people who emerged from Immortal Palace didn't have any weakness. Even their flesh was definitely enough to overlook all peers. Their golden bodies were undying, simply like eternal bodies!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have a feeling that young devil king’s magical force most likely hadn’t been cultivated to the peak, and that he didn’t come from any ancient inheritance, which is why he is no match…” An elder sighed softly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What a pity. I thought that the individuals from the hidden inheritances emerged. Now it looks like this isn’t the case.” An old sect master also spoke like this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite this being the case, everyone outside the secret realm was still hopeful. They wanted to see just how powerful that young devil king was, how many strikes he could endure in front of Immortal Palace’s young great one before being defeated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though everyone knew that he was powerful, they wouldn’t bet on him winning. They didn’t think that he could make it past this, and thought that he will most likely be killed in the end.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within the depths of the secret realm, deafening ear splitting sounds rang out. The two individuals were fighting intensely.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The pill furnace was scarlet red. A True Phoenix danced about, its feathers beautiful and releasing resplendent immortal multicolored radiance. Shi Hao was incomparably courageous. He had one hand hold the furnace body and the other the furnace lid as he fought a great battle against this powerful opponent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Metallic sounds continuously rang through the heavens. The two individuals’ intense battle already lasted more than sixty exchanges. For ordinary people, this wasn’t much, but against Immortal Palace’s inheritor, this was a rare event.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At first, a few people thought that Immortal Palace’s inheritor would kill his opponent in several tens of strikes, never expecting that this young devil king would actually be so deep and unmeasurable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, some people also saw some clues. Neither of the two had let their secret methods or magical powers erupt, and so far, it was mainly just a battle of physical power.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite this being the case, it was still incredibly shocking. It made many experts’ eyes dazzled!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">weng</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;sounded. The void trembled lightly. The great halberd disappeared. The sky split open, and then it suddenly appeared at the base of Shi Hao’s arms. He was going to slice off one of his arms.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dang!</span></p>

It was scarlet red like blood and also suffused with a golden radiance. It was exceptionally beautiful and mysterious as it blocked there, neutralizing the situation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiu!</span></p>
