 <p><strong>Chapter 179 A Certain Depressed Someone</strong></p>
 <p>Wandering Cloud could feel that something was fishy recently.</p>
 <p>He was unable to figure it out, but he could feel a sense of danger.</p>
 <p>When the dust settled after an intense love making, he leaned his head against the headboard and lit a cigarette. The man frowned with deep puzzlement.</p>
 <p>“What are you thinking about?” Into The Sunset snuggled closer to him from underneath the bed sheet, tracing circles on his chest with her petite fingers. Her face was flushed and her voice hoarse. It was apparent that she had been doing something earlier on.</p>
 <p>“Nothing.” Wandering Cloud stared at Into The Sunset, at a loss for words. He then shook his head gloomily.</p>
 <p>“Don’t tell me it’s nothing,” Into The Sunset pouted, rubbing her breasts across his chest, “You’re normally not like this.”</p>
 <p>“How would I normally be?” Wandering Cloud narrowed his eyes and asked in a low voice.</p>
 <p>“Aiya! You meanie! Do you really have to ask such a thing?” answered Into The Sunset shyly as she buried herself into Wandering Cloud’s embrace.</p>
 <p>“You little whore.” Wandering Cloud smiled, “You insatiable little whore.”</p>
 <p>“You’re the cause of it!” Into The Sunset was not angry, and instead became even more flirtatious.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Into The Sunset leaned into Wandering Cloud’s embrace with a satisfied expression and closed her eyes. Making love passionately twice in a row left her slightly exhausted.</p>
 <p>Wandering Cloud, however, was unable to relax. As he held Into The Sunset in his embrace, he thought about the ongoing issues in the guild recently. Something was very fishy. The Tang Dynasty that he and NightAndDay had invested in took 6 years to reach its current prime. Although he was betraying his friend by having an affair with Into The Sunset, he did not want to be a loser for the rest of his life.</p>
 <p>Since they had all invested in the guild, he deserved to reap the rewards from it. It was the same when it comes to women. He had been careful, and NightAndDay trusted him. But lately, the man had been treating him differently.</p>
 <p>“Sunset, have you noticed anything strange about NightAndDay recently?” After being unable to figure it out himself, Wandering Cloud decided to wake Into The Sunset who was fast asleep.</p>
 <p>“There’s nothing out of the ordinary. Aiya, don’t disturb my sleep, I’m tired!” Into The Sunset grumbled unhappily at her sleep being disrupted by Wandering Cloud. She turned around and tried to go back to sleep.</p>
 <p>“Wait, I need to ask. Has he been treating you differently? Have you noticed anything weird?” Wandering Cloud once again roused Into The Sunset from her sleep.</p>
 <p>“It’s still the same!” Into The Sunset forced herself awake, “Eating, sleeping and playing games. He did mention something about taking me out for my birthday,” she yawned sleepily, and continued after noticing Wandering Cloud’s expression, “I declined it of course! I told him that I’m going to celebrate it with a friend. Hehe, you must keep me company alright?”</p>
 <p>Different emotions flashed across Wandering Cloud’s face, then he spoke up after a long pause, “I think he is beginning to suspect our relationship.”</p>
 <p>At this point, Into The Sunset was startled wide awake. She sat up abruptly and stared at Wandering Cloud, her face full of fear, “AH! Don’t scare me like that!”</p>
 <p>Wandering Cloud did not respond immediately. He studied Into The Sunset with an odd expression, as if he did not know who she was at all. This put more fear into her heart. She was even more worried that she originally was when she first heard Wandering Cloud’s words.</p>
 <p>“Why are you staring at me like that?” Feeling uncomfortable under Wandering Cloud’s gaze, Into The Sunset nudged him lightly.</p>
 <p>As her hand came into contact with Wandering Cloud, he grabbed ahold of her wrist. He was not as gentle as Into The Sunset and grabbed her with force. Feeling the pain, Into The Sunset creased her eyebrows and cried out, “What are you doing? You’re hurting me! Let go!”</p>
 <p>Wandering Cloud tightened his grip the more she struggled, and his expression darkened with each passing second. He stared sharply at Into The Sunset, having no intention of loosening his grip. It was as if he would eat her alive.</p>
 <p>Into The Sunset became even more afraid after witnessing Wandering Cloud’s behavior, and her struggling intensified. Right at that moment, she was terrified of the man in front of her, “Let go of me! Let go of me!” she raised her voice, almost breaking into tears.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Wandering Cloud seemed to realize what he was doing. The scary expression on his face vanished, and he released his grip on Into the Sunset. He then spoke up calmly, “You’re afraid of Night?”</p>
 <p>Into The Sunset pulled her hand back and stole a glance at Wandering Cloud. It was as if the man who she was so afraid of moments ago was just an illusion. She massaged her hand while casting a glare at Wandering Cloud and replied after a short pause, “What is there to be afraid of?”</p>
 <p>“Then why are you so surprised?”</p>
 <p>Into The Sunset let out a sigh, “Even if I’m not afraid of him, he’s my fiance. We’ve even met our respective family members. I’m not really afraid of him if he finds out about our relationship, but my family would definitely create a huge commotion.”</p>
 <p>Wandering Cloud remained silent for a long moment, “You’re right, you and Night are a legitimate couple. We’re just having an illicit fling?”</p>
 <p>Knowing that Wandering Cloud was angry, Into The Sunset leaned in closer to him and smiled. “Aiya, don’t be angry, aren’t I by your side right now? Aren’t I in front of you right now? Is there anything more important than this? Even though I’m Night’s fiance, we rarely meet.”</p>
 <p>Wandering Cloud snorted, “That’s because you’re not living together. Won’t you be seeing him every day if you’re living with him?”</p>
 <p>Into The Sunset narrowed her eyes as she smiled, “How can I live with him? My mother taught me that a good girl must not live with a man before her marriage.”</p>
 <p>“And what are you doing right now?”</p>
 <p>“Aiya! Aren’t I your little whore?” Into The Sunset smiled seductively. Her demeanor was entirely different from the dignified and composed persona that she displayed in her daily life.</p>
 <p>Wandering Cloud smiled at her without saying a single word. His heart was filled with frustration. If I have what NightAndDay has, I would be the one marrying Into The Sunset. When such thoughts surfaced, it would never disappear easily and would only become more and more engraved into one’s mind. Such was the case for Wandering Cloud. The more he thought about it, the stronger his desire to take NightAndDay down.</p>
 <p>After lightly teasing each other for a while, Into The Sunset resumed their earlier conversation, “You mentioned that he has noticed something going on between us? Is that for real? Are you sure?”</p>
 <p>“No, it’s just a hunch.” Wandering Cloud shook his head. He did not wish to keep anything secret from Into The Sunset. After all, they were in the same boat.</p>
 <p>“Aiya, if it’s just a hunch, don’t make such irresponsible remarks. You scared the shit out of me.” Into The Sunset let out a long breath of relief. She was truly alarmed by Wandering Cloud’s earlier words.</p>
 <p>“You said he’s going to celebrate your birthday with you?” asked Wandering Cloud after a slight pause.</p>
 <p>“Yup. And I told you that I declined. I want to be with you.”</p>
 <p>“Has he ever taken the initiative to ask you out during your previous birthdays?” Wandering Cloud’s spider senses were still tingling. There was this weird feeling in his gut that he was unable to explain, and he asked that question to clear his suspicions.</p>
 <p>“Nope. That man does not know what it takes to be romantic. When I asked to watch fireworks with him, he told me that it’s dangerous at night. I wouldn’t even dare to dream of him taking the initiative to celebrate my birthday with me, I just don’t know what’s going on in his brain this year,” Into The Sunset snorted, “I will show him that it’s too late for him now.”</p>
 <p>Wandering Cloud’s expression darkened, he had finally confirmed his suspicions. He grabbed ahold of Into The Sunset and asked, “When did he invite you?”</p>
 <p>“About a month or two ago…” Into The Sunset tilted her head, and let out a sigh, “I can’t remember. I tend to forget the words of people that I’m not interested in.”</p>
 <p>“Think carefully. When did it happen?” Wandering Cloud was frustrated by Into The Sunset’s behavior.</p>
 <p>Despite her tendency to tease Wandering Cloud, Into The Sunset earnestly tried to recall after noticing his behavior. After a brief moment, she shouted in reply, “Ah! I remember now!”</p>
 <p>“So, when was it?”</p>
 <p>“Do you remember that time when we had a fight with Upwards Ho!? It happened 2 days after that incident.”</p>
 <p>Wandering Cloud froze. What happened that day was still deeply engraved in his memory. After a brief conversation with Gongzi You via private message, NightAndDay called for a retreat. He was curious but afraid at the same time. When asked, NightAndDay told him that Gongzi You agreed to give them a dungeon clearance video if he agreed to retreat.</p>
 <p>At that time, Wandering Cloud accepted NightAndDay’s explanation. But right at this moment… He realized that NightAndDay might have lied to him.</p>
