 <p>Chapter 311 Things To Be Said&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Ci left the dining room and her mother as if she was escaping for her life. She had always known of the cunning side hidden behind her mother’s usual kind demeanor.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>And that hidden attribute had almost driven her to tears.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She was absolutely certain that Zuo Xiaolan had found out about the pictures, along with Ye Nantian and Bai Mo. Even Tan Polang knew of them as well.&nbsp;<em>Oh God… They knew… And I was still lying to myself! How can I be so stupid!&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>What do I do? What do I do?&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Ci’s brains were overheating as she leaned against the door of her room. She could not think, and she was barely able to suppress the urge to scream in frustration. By the time she snapped back into reality, even her feet had become numb.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Whatever. There’s no use worrying about it now. Since the cat’s already out of the bag, they can do what they want with me.&nbsp;</em>Ye Ci had already given up on salvaging the situation.&nbsp;<em>It’s just a kiss… It’s not like I’ll die from it!&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Ci turned around to face the mirror on her dressing table. She attempted to force a smile, but found her expression to be sour instead.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She sighed and decided to give up.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Whatever, it’s not like they’ll do anything to me anyways. I mustn’t think too much about it. Better get online.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Hence, Ye Ci logged into the game with very low spirits. But she had forgotten that she would be facing an even more awkward atmosphere in the game.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Of course, Ye Ci was quick to realise the problem, but it was too late as Fleeting Time was already greeting her, “Hi Little Gongzi, I guess you’re online as well.” His voice crushed Ye Ci’s hope of logging off the game. She wanted to run away, but she refused to do it in front of Fleeting Time. She hated to show her weak side to anyone, especially when that someone was Fleeting Time.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>And that was how she found herself in an extremely awkward situation, “Yup. You’re early.” but she still replied with as much courtesy she could muster.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Nah, I’ve only just logged in.” Fleeting Time nodded with an unfathomable smile.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Oh.” responded Ye Ci with a nod of her own as she proceeded to gravitate to the furthest section of the cell away from Fleeting Time. She sat down on the ground and immediately shut her eyes. She did not know how to face Fleeting Time, as she would be reminded of what took place the day before.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But she felt a presence taking a seat beside her, and her eyes immediately shot open in time to see Fleeting Time’s smiling face, “Weren’t you there just now? Why do you have to sit beside me? This cell has enough space for the both of us!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Well, it’s not yours.” Fleeting Time shrugged, “I can sit wherever I want.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Ci was rendered speechless.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Alright then, if you’re acting shameless…</em> Ye Ci stood up and sat in another corner. But Fleeting Time followed her to the corner as well, “What is it this time?!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Well this feels like a better place.” Fleeting Time was beaming at her.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Ci stood up, and proceeded to yet another spot in the cell. But no matter she went, Fleeting Time followed. And the two found themselves in a game of tag in the cell.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Hey, what are you doing!” they were soon stopped by the same warden that had witnessed their previous “fight.”.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Fleeting Time chuckled when he saw the NPC, “We’re doing some warming up exercises!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Warming up?” the warden’s eyebrows furrowed. Realisation soon dawned upon the NPC, “Are you trying to break out of the prison?!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“No. How are we supposed to escape with so many guards around?” Fleeting Time smiled meaningfully at the guard, “Besides, it’s not like I’m in any hurry to get out yet.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The warden continued to stare in amazement as the duo continued chasing each other around in the cell before finally leaving. His job was to stop the inmates from fighting or breaking out of jail. He did not care what they did in the cell.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>And the two finally stopped after a short while. Ye Ci was gasping for air. Her Stamina was exhausted, and so was Fleeting Time’s. They stared at each other for a brief moment and proceeded to stuff food into their mouth to replenish their Stamina and resume the chase.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Why are you following me around?” said Ye Ci as she munched on her food. She realise that her actions had been foolish.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“”What? You don’t know?” Fleeting Time raised an eyebrow.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“How would I know? It’s not like I can read your mind!” Ye Ci snorted.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Fleeting Time smiled in response to Ye Ci’s words as he continued eating his consumables. And Ye Ci, who was not as curious before, was infuriated, “Are you going to answer the question?! What do you think you are? A narrator for some shitty drama?! Catch us in the next episode if you want to know what happens next?!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Have you forgotten about it?” asked Fleeting Time. And Ye Ci stared at him dumbfounded.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“We signed an agreement yesterday. That I’m allowed to woo you for a yea-” Fleeting Time’s voice was gentle.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The sentence was cut short by Ye Ci, “Alright, alright! I get it!” a blush was slowly forming on her face.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She was finally reminded of something that she had forgotten due to the impact of the incident on her. How she wished that she could bury her head into the ground and not face Fleeting Time ever again.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>An untold joy crept into Fleeting Time’s heart when he noticed the blush. He was probably the only one to see this side of Gongzi You in the game.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“So, you are…” Ye Ci could not bring herself to continue the sentence.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But Fleeting Time understood her meaning fully well. This was his first time wooing a girl, and even he found it hard to say it out loud. And he knew very well that it would be impossible for a person like Gongzi You to be straightforward when it came to matters about their relationship.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Fleeting Time did not wish to see his first romantic experience go down in flames.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It was a strange and yet very refreshing experience. He was not afraid to try, and even if he might not be able to change its outcome within a year, he would still try his best. He refused to allow himself to become the next White Fairytale.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He did not wish for himself to be filled with regrets.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not even once.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“That’s right.” Fleeting Time nodded, as his expression grew gentler, “I am wooing you..”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“No, don’t say it!” the blush on Ye Ci’s face deepened. The words dealt more damage to walls surrounding her heart than the kiss they shared. She did not know how to deal with them.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“No. some things must be said.” responded Fleeting Time as he took her hands into his and stared into her eyes.&nbsp;</p>
