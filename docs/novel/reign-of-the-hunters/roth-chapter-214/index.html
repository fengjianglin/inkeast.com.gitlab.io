 <p><strong>Chapter 201 Party Coordination (Part 2)</strong></p>
 <p>Ye Ci silently adjusted her frame of mind, then took a deep breath before yelling loudly, "Get ready to start."</p>
 <p>Once she gave her order, everyone stood at the three points mentioned in the strategy she had explained earlier.</p>
 <p>"The BOSS won't use any skills at this stage. Everyone control your output. The important thing is to save the use of your main skills. They better not still be on cooldown when we enter the second stage. Also, don’t waste mana, don't use mana-costly skills. Your first mana potion should be consumed only after we reach the second stage." After commencing, Ye Ci calmly pointed out the key points of this first stage.</p>
 <p>That said, many party members were greedy and didn't heed Ye Ci's advice, instead spamming their attacks. The damage values that appeared were truly beautiful. But to Ye Ci, who had been constantly making calculations the moment they entered the dungeon, these damage values did not make her the slightest bit happy. She could foresee them lacking power in the later stages because their damage had been too high in this first stage. Despite this, Ye Ci didn't yell for them to stop. In accordance with her usual practice, she would still struggle twice even when something was impossible. This was only the beginning, how could she give up now?</p>
 <p>Because there were so many members who didn't listen to her directions, she did her utmost to increase her DPS, which caused Dani to quickly enter the second stage. All they heard was Dani shriek, "This is my world, I won't let you be so impudent here."</p>
 <p>It had barely spoken before they saw four Dani charging towards them from each side of the pool. Ye Ci immediately shouted, "Pull them away."</p>
 <p>The MT, Bai Mo, had a very good rapport with Ye Ci. Whilst Ye Ci had been yelling just now, he had already sprinted past the healers, attracting the aggro of the four doppelgangers, then charging over to where the healers were positioned.</p>
 <p>"Healers, come over and regroup with the ranged attackers. Remember to pay attention to healing the melee fighters. The main and vice-healer are assigned to the MT. You absolutely cannot let it OT. OT is definitely not the Tank's responsibility here.</p>
 <p>"Rangers, give me some mana." The healers had only just joined the ranged attackers when Ye Ci suddenly heard someone call out in the general chat. She turned around to look. The speaker was a Sorcerer called Salad Mustard. Ye Ci promptly opened up the data statistics to look up his numbers. According to the team data, this man was not a main damage dealer. Usually, his output in a dungeon would only be considered medium. Furthermore, when Mi Lu commanded everyone to do their utmost in outputting damage, he was only in thirty-somethingth place. However, when they had just begun fighting, she had told everyone to control their output yet this fellow's output was at the top, exceeding Timely Rain and Pickled Pepper Phoenix Claw, whose outputs were usually at the top, by a large margin. This indicated that he had simply disregarded their commands just now, incessantly increasing aggro and accumulating damage, downright squandering all of his mana.</p>
 <p>After Salad Mustard issued this request, a Ranger called Torrential Tide replied, "The cooldown for a Mana Infusion is 3 minutes, we can't give you mana as you please. You should first drink a potion."</p>
 <p>"I've already consumed a potion. My mana potion is still on cooldown, just give me some, okay?"</p>
 <p>"Why didn’t you control your mana, how could you be running on empty?" Another female Ranger called Sugar Candy Sweets couldn't help complain, "There are only 8 Rangers in the group. If we give you one now, then what will we do when it's urgent, when many people need Mana Infusions?"</p>
 <p>"I spent all my mana on fighting the BOSS, it's not like I was playing around." Sugar Candy Sweets's words clearly made Salad Mustard very unhappy.</p>
 <p>"What are you quarrelling about, is now the time to be quarrelling?" Seeing that a few people were unexpectedly starting a quarrel, Overflowing Ink immediately put a stop to it before turning to ask Ye Ci, "Leader…"</p>
 <p>"Each Sorcerer and Warlock has two chances to receive a Mana Infusion. They can freely decide when to have mana infused." Ye Ci never cared about such trivial matters, merely informing everyone of her customs. She then said, "Sugar Candy Sweets, give Mustard some of your mana."</p>
 <p>"Okay." Sugar Candy Sweets was obviously very reluctant, but since Ye Ci had already issued the order, she could only start infusing her mana to him. Following this, everyone heard the sound of a notification transmitted in the command channel. "Salad Mustard, occupation: Sorcerer. Sugar Candy Sweets has given him a Mana Infusion once. Remaining Mana Infusion chances: one time."</p>
 <p>This skill notification system actually existed much earlier, but ordinary commanders would seldom have the skill to be able to properly predict how much mana would be consumed during a fight. Thus, this system would seldom display such negligence of theirs.</p>
 <p>However, this wasn't a difficult matter for Ye Ci. In fact, she had already made her calculations while Mi Lu and Overflowing Ink were taking command. When everyone was making preparations earlier, Ye Ci actually had made many preparations herself, exerting a lot of effort especially in regards to the setup of this system.</p>
 <p>And now, this system showed its effect straightaway.</p>
 <p>All of the damage dealers immediately began paying attention to their mana. After all, sorcerers and warlocks only had two chances to receive Mana Infusions, not to mention the other classes… Suddenly, everyone became self-conscious regardless of their class. They no longer dared to spam their skills recklessly.</p>
 <p>Salad Mustard was even more apprehensive. Hearing the system notification, he then became aware that he had started getting too greedy, wasting so much mana. He only had one more chance, would he still be able to persevere until the end of the third stage if he continued like this?</p>
 <p>Due to the fact that everyone was avoiding this system, their damage output became restrained, so much so that some people started lapsing in output. When Dani summoned its doppelgangers for the second time, it wiped out a bunch of the damage dealers. Upon seeing this, Ye Ci didn't hesitate to issue the order to withdraw.</p>
 <p>Everyone immediately withdrew, then slowly rescued their teammates and replenished their supplies. Ye Ci saw everyone sitting on the ground beginning their recovery process, then said, "Everyone needs to get used to this system. This system is here to optimise everyone's skill combination and make you more aware about running out of mana. There's no other purpose, as long as everyone listens to commands when outputting damage. You don't need to hold the system in such high regard."</p>
 <p>Soon after, Ye Ci continued, "Actually, needing a Mana Infusion early isn't such a bad thing. After all, each Mana Infusion has a cooldown of 3 minutes. If everyone concentrates their Mana Infusion requests in the one stage, the Rangers would surely lose out. So, party members who need a Mana Infusion early on don't need to feel pressured. As long as you make the most of your skills, everyone need not be overly worried."</p>
 <p>Many people felt reassured after hearing these words. Mustard's example just now left everyone's minds in a perturbed mess, afraid that they would upset their commander if they needed one too early. They had never thought that Gongzi You would not blame everyone, instead very considerately relieving the pressure on everyone. This caused everyone to let out long sighs of relief.</p>
 <p>After properly adjusting everyone's state of mind, Ye Ci again issued the order to set off. Although Ye Ci was determined to seize First Blood this time, she deemed the revision of the entire team's fighting tempo more important so they could cultivate good battle habits. After all, the business with Unbridled Willow was merely a single transaction, whereas leading her team was a long-term matter.</p>
 <p>This time, everyone was clearly more obedient. During the controlling output period, people no longer used mana-costly skills. Even though this extended the time spent on the first stage, it opened the highest possibility of rapidly concluding the second stage.</p>
 <p>The first stage passed without a hitch and they entered the second stage very quickly. Bai Mo acted as MT and secured the aggro very well, which let the sub-tank Little Icy Cold Hands equip offense-oriented equipment and incessantly spam skills for a while. After Ye Ci saw Bai Mo pull the BOSS, she immediately sent out an order, "All DPS spam your powerful skills and focus fire."</p>
 <p>This command let everyone who had been holding back for an entire stage give a sigh of relief. All the DPS franticly used their skills at once. The only thing that could be seen was the health bar of Dani sharply dropping. Ye Ci continued outputting damage while paying close attention to the status of Dani's health bar. As soon as she saw that there were approximately 8 bars of health before it would enter the third stage, she once again shouted firmly, "Control your attacks, control your mana. Let your cooldowns recover."</p>
 <p>Having experienced it once before, everyone complied to her orders completely this time. They curbed their powerful moves, and used some skills that didn't cost much mana. On one hand, they were recovering mana, on the other hand, they were waiting for their powerful moves to get off cooldown. At this moment, Ye Ci was all-out opening fire. After all, amongst everyone in the group, she was the only one who didn't fear wasting her mana. If she also held back during this time and the DPS turned out inadequate, Dani was liable to bring out another batch of doppelgangers. If it summoned another batch of doppelgangers, their party would very likely get wiped out.</p>
 <p>Ye Ci intently focused on Dani's situation. Based on her past experience, the BOSS would typically give itself a BUFF. If the players had yet to reach the third stage when the BUFF wore off, then the second batch of doppelgangers would unlimitedly detonate.</p>
 <p>As expected, Dani extended her arms and rose in the air with a piercing shout. "God of wind and snow, please bestow power unto me."</p>
 <p>Soon after, a "Rage" BUFF appeared under Dani's icon. At this time, Ye Ci immediately called out the names of several damage dealers. "Those whose names I call out, raise your output to the MAX. If I don't call your name, continue your conservative output."</p>
 <p>The rage BUFF lasted 5 minutes. Ye Ci called out 8 DPS every 30 seconds to focus fire their output. The names she called were also chosen after tight calculations. Each time she called out names of both high damage dealers as well as people with comparatively lower DPS. As much as possible, she made it so that each time she called out names, the players responsible for damage output would not have too much of a discrepancy in output.</p>
 <p>This method was clearly very effective. All the DPS were highly tense. For those 30 seconds of output, they seemed to be holding back a portion of their strength, waiting until their name was called, after which they would spam their skills at Dani as though their life depended on it. This kind of focused eruption was actually inversely higher than their usual damage output.</p>
 <p>Upwards Ho!'s current equipment was not considered poor, but their coordination and awareness was inferior to the major guilds. As a result, Ye Ci's roll calling for a focused assault was both for defeating the BOSS, as well as for tempering their reactions and coordination. With only 42 seconds remaining, Dani finally entered the third stage. This process was a lot slower than Ye Ci would have wished, however, she was still quite satisfied. After polishing them up like this several more times, she believed that they would become very sharp blades.</p>
 <p>After all, both sweat and effort needed to be invested for talent to take shape.</p>
 <p>"MT, 2nd Tank, chase the BOSS around for a lap. All of the DPS and healers, follow me. If you get poisoned, don't panic. All you need to do is run over to the Tanks. Icy Cold Little Hands, you're in charge of healing the poisoned."</p>
 <p>Bai Mo was true to his role as one of the top ten Tanks in her previous life. Although he had merely heard Ye Ci explain the running pace and speed once while they had been recovering, he was already so proficient it seemed like he had done this very many times. On the contrary, it was Little Icy Cold Hands who was completely tense, following Bai Mo while saying, "Old Mo, you carry, I’m still not ready to pull it yet. You better not fall, I'll be following you for a lap to familiarise myself with the pace."</p>
 <p>"Why are you so tense for. If I die, you'll be able to carry just as well." Bai Mo was so unconcerned that he even had the leisure to give Little Icy Cold Hands a smile.</p>
 <p>"I'm not nervous about your skills, I'm worried about the healers who will be healing us." Little Icy Cold Hands was not this tense for no reason. In the guild, the main healers were Icy Cold Little Hands and Fruit Jelly. However, Fruit Jelly had recently been obsessed with outputting damage and seldom healed, so Rain Butterfly was transferred over to act as a secondary healer. Furthermore, Icy Cold Little Hands had now been assigned the responsibility of curing poison, so the main healers for Bai Mo had become Rain Butterfly and another Cleric called Ghost Cat, as well as a Priest called Tree Desires Tranquillity. Of the three of them, only Rain Butterfly had a bit of experience with healing the MT. Ghost Cat and Tree Desires Tranquillity both usually healed melee fighters or DPS, and had absolutely zero experience with healing the MT. When they were named to heal Bai Mo, they became so nervous that their hands started shaking.</p>
 <p>They were all nervous, not to mention Little Icy Cold Hands who was soaked in sweat. He was acting as though he was the MT.</p>
 <p>Bai Mo naturally knew what Little Icy Cold Hands was concerned about, but this was something they could only discuss quietly in private, and not something to be shared aloud. Once it was divulged, he was afraid it might affect Ghost Cat and Tree Desires Tranquillity's mental states, causing them to feel even more nervous.</p>
 <p>Bai Mo laughed, flicking his eyes over to look at the three people who were as nervous or even more so than Little Icy Cold Hands. He purposely spoke in the command channel. "To be a Tank is to trust in the healers. If a Tank doesn't even have faith in his healers, how could he dare face the BOSS?"</p>
 <p>Little Icy Cold Hands was a little dazed. He looked at the three's mood again and knew that Bai Mo was intentionally saying this for them to hear. His mind couldn't help relax. He rushed over to Bai Mo and laughed, "Of course you, Old Mo, would be so light-hearted."</p>
 <p>The three healers in charge of healing the MT and 2nd Tank heard Bai Mo's words, and their originally tense mood unexpectedly loosened up.</p>
 <p>Ye Ci heard Bai Mo's words. She then glanced at the three healers and the strained-faced Little Icy Cold Hands again, and saw through Bai Mo's intentions. She turned her head towards the other ranged fighters and said, "My movement speed is comparatively fast. I will slow down my pace to wait for you, but you guys better not fall behind. Otherwise, you'll be hit by ice blades."</p>
 <p>Many players had already died in the third stage. At this time, they were so tense that they couldn’t even speak properly. Naturally, whatever Ye Ci said would be right. At this same time, Ye Ci issued her first and only order of the third stage, "DPS focus fire on the Boss. Don't be afraid of not having mana, those without mana start getting Mana Infusions now."</p>
