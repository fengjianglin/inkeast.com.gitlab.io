 <p>Chapter 300 Reaction (Part 4)&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When Liao Dandan pushed open Mo Leng’s front door after unlocking it with a set of spare keys, she could smell gas in the air. She immediately covered her nose and dashed into the kitchen to turn the stove off and proceeded to open up all the windows for ventilation before finally searching for Mo Leng.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Laio Dandan found Mo Leng leaning against her gaming cabin in the studies. She was unconscious. Liao Dandan could feel her heart in her mouth, and immediately called for an ambulance.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She then walked up to Mo Leng, and placed a finger under her nose. The girl was still breathing.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Liao Dandan called out to Mo Leng again and again, but Mo Leng never regained consciousness. It was as if she was already dead.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The ambulance arrived just when Liao Dandan was at the brink of losing her mind. She accompanied Mo Leng into the back of the ambulance, and called Fang Congshu on her way to the hospital, “Have you managed to get ahold of Fleeting Time, honey?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I just got off the phone with him. What is it? Are you at Mo Leng’s right now? How’s she doing?” Fang Congshu was in a bad mood after this call with Fleeting Time.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Liao Dandan, who would usually protest to such attitude, only responded with a faint voice, “She attempted to commit suicide by inhaling gas. I’m riding along with her in an ambulance on the way to the hospital.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“What!” Fang Congshu was shocked.&nbsp;<em>Mo Leng will never kill herself</em>. Fleeting Time’s words were still ringing in his ears.&nbsp;<em>You do not know her, Fleeting Time!</em> He thought,&nbsp;<em>A girl will do anything out of desperation, and this blow might have just driven her to commit suicide!&nbsp;</em>“Which hospital are you headed to? I’ll be on my way!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Fang Congshu immediately put on a change of clothes and sped to the hospital in his car once he received a reply. He saw Liao Dandan sitting alone by the bench outside of the emergency room, and ran up to her, “Honey!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Liao Dandan raised her head and looked at Fang Congshu. Her face was pale, her eyes red and puffy, and her body was trembling. It was apparent that she had received quite the shock. She pulled Fang Congshu into an embrace and spoke through sobs, “Honey, she’ll be fine right? Right?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Fang Congshu hugged his wife tightly and comforted her, “It’ll be alright honey. With how advanced technology is nowadays, she will be fine.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Just then, a male doctor pushed past the doors of the emergency room, “Are the family members of Mo Leng present?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Yes! It’s me!” Fang Congshu stood up and dashed towards the doctor.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You are…” the doctor stared at the two approaching individuals. He was hesitant at first, but his gaze finally rested on Fang Congshu.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“We are Mo Leng’s friends. Her best friends in this city.” replied Liao Dandan.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Very well. Her condition is stable now. We’ve admitted her into a normal ward for further observation. You can go visit her now.” said the doctor as he removed his surgical mask and smiled at Fang Congshu, “Oh come on Old Fang, do you not recognise me anymore?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Fang Congshu was stunned. He studied the face of the doctor standing before him and recognition immediately dawned upon him, “Liu Zi! It’s you!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Heh, you still remember me after 20 years? Not bad!” Liu Zi chuckled. “A friend of your wife?” asked the doctor when he noticed Liao Dandan’s expression.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Yup.” Fang Congshu nodded. He knew what was going on in his mind. Even he himself was not in the mood to catch up with his friend.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But Liu Zi spoke up before Fang Congshu could voice his mind, “Why don’t you go on first, madam? I would like to talk to Old Fang for a moment. I’ll get someone to take you there.” and he motioned to a nurse nearby.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Liao Dandan eyed the doctor suspiciously, and then at Fang Congshu before leaving with the nurse.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Liu Zi spoke to Fang Congshu when Liao Dandan was no longer within earshot, “It is not my place to ask, but since it’s you, I guess I’ll have to.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“What is it?” Fang Congshu and Liu Zi were childhood friends who had not seen each other for 20 years after being separated in primary school. But they maintained a close friendship, and they would always get straight to the point with each other.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Are you having an affair with the girl with the suicide attempt?” asked Liu Zi.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Fang Congshu almost gagged at the question, “Heh, you’re still able to almost shock me to death with the first few words that leave your mouth eh?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Of course. So is the lady with the gas poisoning something other than the friend of your wife?” a fake smile appeared on Liu Zi’s face.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Of course not!” Fang Congshu said with a gesture of his hand, “I can’t stand that woman! She’s a friend of my wife who has taken a liking to another friend of ours. She has no interest in me at all. Even if she does, I don’t think I have it in me to stand her!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Liu Zi nodded, “Oh, then it’s all good. Alright, I’ll get back to work. Don’t forget to keep in touch!” and he handed Fang Congshu his phone number.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Fang Congshu stopped Liu Zi before he could leave, “Hey, don’t just leave me hanging like this. Tell me what’s going on!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Since it has nothing to do with you, just forget about it.” Liu Zi shrugged. He was not a person who likes to gossip.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Come on, just tell me! That friend of mine is in America right now. If you have anything about the girl, just let me know. She might not have her eyes on me, but she’s driving me insane!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Liu Zi studied Fang Congshu’s expression for a long moment before finally nodding, “Alright then. This girl is a cunning one. If you have an affair with her, end it, or she will bring you trouble.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You know her!?” exclaimed Fang Congshu.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“No, this is the first time I’ve seen her.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Then why did you say that?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“According to your wife, she received a phone call from that girl 40 minutes ago.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Yup, that sounds about right.” Fang Congshu nodded in confirmation. There was a one-hour gap from when Liao Dandan first received the call from Mo Leng, and when Fang Congshu was notified of the suicide attempt by Liao Dandan.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“If she really intends to kill herself, then she would’ve immediately turned on the gas after ending the call. She would’ve been dead by the time your wife arrives. Even Jesus himself would not be able to save her.” Liu Zi smiled cynically at the situation, “But she’s only suffering from minor gas poisoning. Based on my calculations, she has only inhaled around 10 minutes worth of gas. It’s very hard to cause a person’s death with that amount.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Huh? Why the hell did she do that?” Fang Congshu was shocked.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“How would I know?” Liu Zi turned around and was about to head back to work, “Remember to stay in contact. My mom would always get me to pay your mom a visit, why didn’t you do the same?!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Alright, alright. I’ll do it someday.” Fang Congshu nodded. He appeared relaxed, but his heart was in turmoil after receiving the news from Liu Zi. He stood in front of the emergency room for a brief moment before heading to Mo Leng’s ward.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He did not enter, and instead listened in on the conversation between Liao Dandan and Mo Leng outside.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Why did you do something so stupid! It’s better to be alive! If you die, what chance do you have with him?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>‘Do I even have any left? He would not even look at me, but he spreaded those pictures everywhere! How can I live after seeing that? Everybody knows that I’ve liked him for years! My parents thought that we’re dating each other! I can’t just tell everyone now that he likes someone else and not me! How can I carry on living after that? I should’ve just died!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Why are you so obsessed with him? He’s not the only man in the world, it doesn’t have to be him!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“It must! It must be him! I can’t live without him!” Mo Leng sniffed, “Dandan, please, help me one last time. I can’t live without him!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Fang Congshu bursted into the room and disrupted the conversation before Liao Dandan could give her reply. He was quickly able to find an excuse to leave the room with Liao Dandan after having some small talk with Mo Leng.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Stay out of this.” Fang Congshu spoke with a firm tone.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“But.. Don’t you pity her? She attempted suicide because of Fleeting Time!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Do you really think that she did it for real?” Fang Congshu sneered as he relayed what Liu Zi had said to Liao Dandan. “I will not play messenger for you any longer” said Fang Congshu before heading to the parking lot, “If you still want to meddle in their affairs, then you go talk to Fleeting Time yourself.” and he continued after a slight pause, “That girl is very cunning. Don’t let her drag our guild down.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>And with that, an angered Fang Congshu walked away, leaving Liao Dandan standing alone in the cold, bone-chilling wind.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Bai Mo had been quiet throughout the entire night.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>And it was a rare sight, as Bai Mo was a person who would always talk and crack the occasional jokes to cheer his guild members up during an expedition into a dungeon. The silence was almost suffocating.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Even the entire party was silent. The channel was silent other than the occasional command from the person in charge.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ideal Height 1.7m who could no longer stand the silence sent a message to Timely Rain, “Hey, what’s up with the boss, Little Rain?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“How the hell would I know?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Could it be the pictures that are circulating in the forum?” Ideal Height 1.7m had heard from Release That Girl that Bai Mo and Gongzi You were cousins that shared a very close relationship. It was entirely possible that Bai Mo has gotten jealous due to the incident.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I do not know.” Timely Rain shook his head. He was a man of facts that would not voice his opinion out based on mere assumptions.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ideal Height 1.7m started conversation with Fruit Jelly instead when he realised that he would not get anything out of Timely Rain. The mentality of the males and females when it came to gossip was completely different. Despite her worries, Fruit Jelly was excited at the gossip, “Have you seen the pictures? I haven’t seen all of them yet. Goddamn it OP, why are you holding on to them? Post them already!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I’ve reached the part where they kissed.” Ideal Height 1.7m was excited to find a gossipping partner. And the two main DPS of the party began a lengthy discussion about the pictures of Fleeting Time and Gongzi You.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This is the first time I have such a good look at Fleeting Time’s face, and I got to say, his face is pretty!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Pfft… Is it even a good thing for a guy to have a pretty face?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“That’s not the point. Do you think that Fleeting Time actually did it with Gongzi You?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I guess so. This is the first time he’s involved in a scandal. I’ve heard that he never once showed an interest in girls. Did he just break his taboo for Gongzi?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Well from the pictures at least, that seems to be the case. Then again, Gongzi seems to be quite cooperative. Perhaps she did not dislike Fleeting Time that much deep down.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I think she simply doesn’t understand the wonders of what a man can bring her.” said Fruit Jelly, “The only things she knows are dungeon clearing and First Blood.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You pervert…”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Hey, that’s a fact.”&nbsp;</p>
