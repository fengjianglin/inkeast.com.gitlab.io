 <p></p>
 <p><strong>Chapter 203 Ye Ci’s Troubles</strong></p>
 <p>Ye Ci could feel the black, cursed aura around her thickening.</p>
 <p>The black aura surrounding her was so dark that it painted the entire dungeon black.</p>
 <p>Despite achieving First Blood in a 100-player dungeon, there was not a single piece of Hunter equipment among the loot dropped by the BOSS. Yes, there was not a single one.</p>
 <p>Not. A. Single. One.</p>
 <p>There were nine Hunters in the party including Ye Ci, and all of them were dumbfounded. Ideal Height 1.7m let out a sigh as the other Hunters began drawing circles while crouching in a corner and cursed Ye Ci for bringing them bad luck.</p>
 <p>Ye Ci stood behind them and cleared her throat. She then chuckled as she attempted to console her fellow Hunters, “Uhh… You know… The future is bright and our path ahead is beautiful. We will have more skill books and equipment in the coming days. I swear that I’ll give the priority to you guys when we get any Hunter equipment. How does that sound?”</p>
 <p>Naturally Cute let out a sigh, “The problem is… They might not even drop…”</p>
 <p>The seven other Hunters remained silent, but they nodded in agreement to Naturally Cute’s words. Ye Ci could feel the pressure. I did not ask for this… I did not ask for this…</p>
 <p>Let Go Of That Girl walked up to Ye Ci and waved the pair of gauntlets he had just obtained in front of her, “Gongzi, I think you can drink some of those Balm of Blessings of yours. I’ve heard that you got quite a lot of them during the Dragon Dance Competition.”</p>
 <p>Fruit Jelly joined in on the fun as well, “Yup! Gongzi, we really feel sorry for your bad luck! We’ve all worked hard for the loots! You know how bad we will feel for you, if your bad luck continues?”</p>
 <p>Ye Ci turned around and snorted when she saw the brand new staff held by Fruit Jelly, “Judging from your expression, I highly doubt that.”</p>
 <p>Fruit Jelly chuckled, ignoring Ye Ci’s darkened expression, “Seriously, you should go to the Royal Monastery often and talk to the Archbishop. Go have a dip in the holy water fountain as well! I’m sure your luck will improve as well!”</p>
 <p>Ye Ci’s expression darkened further.</p>
 <p>She stared at Fruit Jelly with a blank expression and spoke calmly, “Do you want me to assign the looting permission to myself during our next expedition?”</p>
 <p>The entire party was stunned silent. They stared at Ye Ci with mouth agape. This improved Ye Ci’s mood greatly.</p>
 <p>That’ll teach them for making fun of me!</p>
 <p>Ye Ci did not stay long in the dungeon. She returned to Red Lake City after giving instructions to the guild officers to gather in the Guild Conference Room after distributing the loot.</p>
 <p>Ol’ Four’s mood was sour after his death in the dungeon. With her stock of roasted meat running out, Ye Ci bought a huge load of meat from one of the taverns as a treat for him before heading up to the nearest mailbox.</p>
 <p>Ye Ci’s mailbox was always clean, as opening mails was one of her favourite pastimes. It made her feel wanted. There was only one mail in her mailbox. It was from Unbridled Willow.</p>
 <p>There was only a short message in the mail, “Kindly accept this down payment.” with 55 million gold coins attached. She accepted the money and headed straight to her guild encampment.</p>
 <p>She entered the Guild Conference Room after reaching her destination.. The officers had already arrived, with faces glowing from excitement.. They were still reminiscing the moment when they defeated the BOSS, anddid not even notice Ye Ci’s presence, even after she entered and took a seat. Ye Ci had to clear her throat to gain their attention.</p>
 <p>“Heh, Gongzi, what we want is celebration, not a darn meeting!” Let Go Of That Girl’s face was flushing red. His excitement was apparent.</p>
 <p>The guild admins and several officers of the first squadron, as well as some officers from the second squadron attended the meeting. Purity Essence was amongst them.</p>
 <p>“We will of course celebrate. But before that, I have something to announce.” said Ye Ci as she set a sack of gold coins onto the table.</p>
 <p>Everybody present held their breath as they laid eyes upon the sack of coins. From the size of the sack, there should be dozens of millions of coins inside... The officers were stunned into silence.</p>
 <p>Even Bai Mo who has mentally prepared himself almost fainted when he saw the sack of coins. There was indeed several million gold coins stored within ‘Upwards Ho!’s warehouse, but it was achieved only through the efforts of the guild members. It was not as awe-inspiring as the huge sum of money that has suddenly appeared in front of them.</p>
 <p>“W-what the hell is this?” asked Icy Cold Little Hands and Little Icy Cold hands in unison. As husband and wife, they became full time gamers after joining ‘Upwards Ho!’. They were able to earn a stable income of 80,000 in terms of real world cash as administrators of the guild. They were not wealthy, but could lead a fulfilling life with what they had. The huge sum of money came as a shock to them.</p>
 <p>The members of ‘Upwards Ho!’ were not poor, but most of them were a far cry away from being wealthy. They were all from medium class families that earned an average salary. They were able to benefit much after joining ‘Upwards Ho!’. This vastly increased their loyalty to the guild.</p>
 <p>“Money.” Ye Ci’s answer was direct and simple.</p>
 <p>Fruit Jelly visibly gulped, “We all know it’s money. But what sort of money?”</p>
 <p>“In-game currency.” Ye Ci intentionally took the question by its literal meaning and let out a smile, “Lots and lots of in-game currency.”</p>
 <p>“How much?” even Ideal Height 1.7m was unable to keep her calm.</p>
 <p>“55 million.”</p>
 <p>The players gathered in the conference room almost coughed up blood.</p>
 <p>In the end, Bai Mo had to step up to save the day. He grabbed Ye Ci’s wrist and started begging, “Say - stop torturing us good folks. Hurry! Tell us the truth! We’re all poor people! If you keep this up, I think most of us will die from a heart attack.!”</p>
 <p>Everyone else agreed with Bai Mo’s words.</p>
 <p>“Before we entered the dungeon, somebody expressed his wish to buy the dungeon-clearing guide from us at the price of 15 million in real world currency. This is the down payment.” Ye Ci’s answer was brief. She had no intention of revealing the identity of their customer.</p>
 <p>“15 million… That’ll be 75 million if you convert it into gold coins… And the transfer fees….” Timely Rain began his calculation, “Holy shit! This guy’s f*cking rich! I guess 15 million is just numbers to him.”</p>
 <p>“To be frank, it’s numbers for us as well.” Pickled Pepper Phoenix Claw pursed her lips. This sum of money meant nothing to the wealthy, which is why it was just a bunch of insignificant numbers. To the poor, it meant a whole world to them. To them, it was a significantly large sum of numbers.</p>
 <p>The officers began discussing with each other.</p>
 <p>“This money will be used to pay the salary for the members who took part in achieving the First Clear today. Timely Rain, give it out when we have our celebration later.” Ye Ci handed the money to Timely Rain.</p>
 <p>“Alright.”</p>
 <p>“Store the rest of the money into the warehouse. As for the equipment repair fees, I’ll let you admin people decide.” said Ye Ci as she stood up, “Go and prepare for the celebration. It’s time for me to collect the balance.”</p>
 <p>“I’m curious, why is that person willing to pay you such a large sum of money even before you entered the dungeon? Won’t he be worried that you might not clear the dungeon?” Purity Essence stared at Ye Ci. He was excited after seeing the large sum of money. Even if he was not part of the first squadron, he was deeply impressed when Ye Ci was able to achieve First Blood and First Five while securing such a huge sum of money.</p>
 <p>Ye Ci smiled at Purity Essence, “First of all, it’s not just my effort alone. Everybody in ‘Upwards Ho!’ did their part. You should use the word ‘us’. And secondly, ” she narrowed her eyes, letting out a overbearing aura, “I am Gongzi You.”</p>
 <p>There’s probably nobody else in this world that could have so much confidence and yet sound so charismatic. thought Purity Essence to himself.</p>
 <p>“Oh, by the way…” Ye Ci suddenly remembered something important, “It’s time for me to collect the balance. I’ll only give the person 3 days. We’ll only wait for 3 days before we continue our expedition into Castle Ruins. I hope that players from the first squadron could have some interaction with the second squadron and show them the ropes. We’ll begin the exploration of Castle Ruins in 3 days. I hope you people will be able to clear this dungeon and secure spots in the First Five.</p>
 <p>I sure expect the dungeon clearance guide to l fetch us a good price after this.”</p>
 <p>Fruit Jelly laughed, “Gongzi, has anybody told you before that you’re a money grubber?”</p>
 <p>“You’re that person.” Ye Ci smiled. She then left the conference room after a small talk with the officers.</p>
 <p>Ye Ci sent Unbridled Willow a message as she stood at the heart of Red Lake City, “Meet me at the largest tavern in Oasis City with the rest of the money.</p>
 <p>The largest tavern in Oasis City was the Crippled Warrior Tavern. Unbridled Willow headed straight for the tavern, even though he was in the dungeon. He left for Oasis City after a brief explanation to Zero Arsenic and headed straight to the Crippled Warrior Tavern.</p>
 <p>Ye Ci arrived at Oasis City shortly after. She headed straight towards Unbridled Willow’s location after confirming his whereabouts.</p>
 <p>Unbridled Willow poured Ye Ci some wine right after she took her seat, but Ye Ci would have none of it. She waved her hand at Unbridled Willow, “You can save the wine, let’s get straight to business.”</p>
 <p>“Alright.” Unbridled Willow nodded. He was looking forward to end this deal quickly.</p>
 <p>“Here’s the video.” Ye Ci placed the video into the trading tab. She was not in a hurry at all to confirm the trade. Unbridled Willow, on the other hand, was very excited as he confirmed the trade. “The money.” said Ye Ci calmly.</p>
 <p>“Ahhh… Look at me, I’ve forgotten all about it!” he then placed 50 million gold coins into the trading tab, “This is the rest of the money. I paid the transaction tax.”</p>
 <p>After confirming the amount of gold coins that was being traded, Ye Ci proceeded with the trade.</p>
 <p>The business was done.</p>
 <p>Unbridled Willow immediately began watching the video. Ye Ci waited for him patiently. She had to give him some time to confirm the content of the video. She ordered a meal from the NPC in their private compartment and began dining as Unbridled Willow studied the video.</p>
 <p>Unbridled Willow was totally immersed in the intense battles shown by the video. Even with the lack of sound, the footages made his blood boil. He started with the intention of watching parts of the video, but he was unable to stop, and finally raised his head when the video was over.</p>
 <p>It took ‘Upwards Ho!’ an hour to defeat the BOSS, which meant that the video lasted for a full hour. Guessing that Unbridled Willow was almost at the end of the video, Ye Ci spoke up, “So, are you satisfied with this?”</p>
 <p>Unbridled Willow was reminded of Ye Ci’s presence in the room. He closed the video and nodded apologetically at Ye Ci, “Ah, sorry, I was too immersed in the video. I’ve even forgotten that you’re here.”</p>
 <p>“Ah, it’s alright. I’ve busied myself with something.” Ye Ci gestured at the empty plate in front of her, indicating that she have had a fine meal.</p>
 <p>Unbridled Willow let out a relieved sigh.</p>
 <p>“I’m giving you three days.” Ye Ci spoke up after she was sure that Unbridled Willow was satisfied with the video.</p>
 <p>“What do you mean by three days?” Unbridled Willow was stunned. He did not get the meaning behind Ye Ci’s words.</p>
 <p>Ye Ci pursed her lips. It seems that Unbridled Willow thinks that his worries have ended after receiving the video. “Three days from now, which will be 72 hours. This is the time I’ll give you to defeat the fifth BOSS.”</p>
 <p>“I don’t think this has anything to do with you.” Unbridled Willow finally understood Ye Ci’s words. He let out a cold laugh. This Gongzi You likes sticking her nose into somebody else’s business. Since she has given me the video, what makes her think that my progress is any of her concern?</p>
 <p>Noting that Unbridled Willow has not fully grasped the meaning behind her words, Ye Ci narrowed her eyes and smiled mockingly.</p>
 <p>“Indeed, I have no say over when you start taking on the BOSS. However, as your collaborator, I would like to remind you that some things should be done sooner even if I do not know about the nature of your conflict with Thousand Sunsets.” noticing that an impatient Unbridled Willow was about to cut her off, Ye Ci raised her hand and continued to speak, “I’m not done yet. I hope you can listen to what I have to say.”</p>
 <p>Unbridled Willow remained silent, and continued to listen to Ye Ci’s words.</p>
 <p>“I would also like to remind you that Wolf Pack is also stuck at the fifth BOSS. They’re unable to get past the third stage of the fight. Tang Dynasty and World Conqueror are preparing for the fifth BOSS. There will be a lot of changes after three days. These guilds might be able to secure First Five. Also…” Ye Ci paused and narrowed her eyes. A ghost of a smile formed on her lips.</p>
 <p>Unbridled Willow’s heart sank. He asked anxiously, “What else?”</p>
 <p>“Also… Do you think that only the first squadron of ‘Upwards Ho!’ is going to explore the Castle Ruins?” Ye Ci smiled.</p>
 <p>“What do you mean?”</p>
