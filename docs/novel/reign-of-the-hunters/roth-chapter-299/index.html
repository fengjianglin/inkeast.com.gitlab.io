 <p><strong>Chapter 243 De’frei Spotted (Part 2)</strong></p>
 <p>Ye Ci and Fleeting Time found themselves standing in front of a row of machines. They could feel the power emanating from the inanimate machines, and the danger posed by their apparent strength. The machines were way larger than all the machines that the duo had previously encountered, and the faint glowing light of their metal armor was a telltale sign that they were crafted from superior materials as well.</p>
 <p>A Goblin in royal gown could be seen on a platform behind the machines with a scepter in his hand. A Drow with slightly dark skin and pointed ears laid in a crystal coffin in front of the Goblin, who was placed his right hand on the coffin. As the Goblin chanted, his hand glowed with a bright light that surrounded the coffin. It was apparent that the Goblin was attempting to complete a ritual.</p>
 <p>Ye Ci could see a gigantic robot that stood at least 80 m tall behind the platform. There’s so many monsters here, so which one of the is the BOSS? This dungeon is ridiculous! There was no BOSS fight at all as we explored this place, but when we ran into a BOSS fight, we have to fight through so many BOSS-tier enemies? Are you kidding me?</p>
 <p>“De'frei spotted! De'frei spotted!” a sound rang out from the Goblin Compass as the duo stared at the spectacle before them. Ye Ci immediately took out the Goblin Compass and stared at the direction indicated by the compass. Her gaze laid upon a Goblin who was busy at work on the head of the giant robot.</p>
 <p>The duo did not trigger any battle upon their entry, which gave them an opportunity to have a good look at their surroundings.</p>
 <p>Common sense dictated that the duo were in the Goblin Royal Palace which is the resident of the Goblin King Ciel. What the duo saw before them, however, told otherwise. The place looked like a huge factory instead of a palace.The mechanical parts and unfinished machines scattered all over the place gave the impression to Ye Ci that this place was no different from a garage.</p>
 <p>The reeking stench of machine oil was a source of great discomfort to Ye Ci. She immediately lowered her head and pinched her nose. She was nauseated by the smell. Fleeting Time then threw a green bottle of liquid at Ye Ci, “Drink this.”</p>
 <p>It was a bottle of perfume.</p>
 <p>Potion Brewers in Fate could create a large variety of potions other than the more conventional Health and Mana potions that were widely used by players, and the bottle of perfume was one such example. It served no other purpose than to give players a nice scent upon consumption. Perfumes could come in varying scents in Fate which had their own unique effect. A rose scented perfume could raise the Intimacy level between couples, while a tuberose scented perfume could allow players to attract specific monsters at night, while the peppermint scented perfume could help with refreshing and clearing the mind… In short, perfumes in Fate were classified as a consumable, and each bottle of perfume could last for two hours.</p>
 <p>Despite their rather underwhelming effects, perfumes are very expensive in the world of Fate. They were luxurious products that an average person could not afford.</p>
 <p>The bottle of perfume that was handed to Ye Ci by Fleeting Time was a peppermint scented perfume, “Do you always bring something like this along with you?” asked Ye Ci, with her curiosity piqued.</p>
 <p>“I saw quite some of them in the guild warehouse, so I took one along. Never expected that I’ll be able to put it to good use.” shrugged Fleeting Time, and Ye Ci was baffled by his response. I’m sure he doesn’t know how expensive this thing can be…</p>
 <p>“Do you have any idea how much this cost?” Ye Ci immediately felt better as she popped open the bottle.</p>
 <p>Fleeting Time smiled as Ye Ci poured the perfume into her mouth, “About 30,000 gold coins a bottle I guess.”</p>
 <p>Ye Ci almost choked when she received his reply, “Then why the hell would you give me something like this?” she asked as she glared at Fleeting Time.</p>
 <p>“Well potions are meant to be consumed the moment they were created. If I leave them in the warehouse instead of using them for their intended purposes, they’ll cry.” said Fleeting Time, “Besides, I’m giving it to you because I feel like it. Is there a problem with that?”</p>
 <p>Ye Ci was once again baffled by Fleeting Time’s words. We must be from different planets! Why is it so hard to make sense of what he said? She finally spoke up after a short moment of silence, “Alright then, you don’t have to give me my cut for the loot we sold last time. They’re worth about a several thousands anyways. Take that as the payment for this perfume.”</p>
 <p>Despite the smile on his face, Fleeting Time’s disapproval was clearly visible in his eyes. An alarm blared off before he could voice his protest, “Intruder alert! Intruder alert!” and a swarm of lvl40 machines appeared to engage the duo in battle. The machines with their relatively low level were still a threat to Ye Ci and Fleeting Time due to their sheer numbers, which forced the duo to launch waves of AOE attacks at their enemies.</p>
 <p>Ye Ci and Fleeting Time were hard pressed by the vast numbers of their opponents, and were even forced to consume two Greater Health Potions just to survive the onslaught of enemies. Fortunately for the duo, the attacks stopped after the last of the machines fell. A second wave of enemies would definitely spell disaster for the duo.</p>
 <p>Before the duo could even have a moment of rest, a shrill voice rang out ahead of them, “Who dares enter my palace and disrupt my ritual?”</p>
 <p>The duo adjusted their sight to the direction of the voice. It was the Goblin who had been standing on the crystal coffin. Ye Ci and Fleeting Time did not have a good look of the Goblin’s appearance as he was facing in the other direction. When he finally turned around to face the duo, they could see the two horns that were as long as the Goblin’s fingers and a gorgeous crown on his head.</p>
 <p>The Goblin was none other than the king of Vo’sok who had betrayed the city to the Bloodthirsty Undead and the Corrupted Orcs: Ciel.</p>
 <p>“Ahh… Two High Elves! Two pretentious High Elves!” Ciel laughed at Ye Ci and Fleeting Time, “I despise your race! Your selfish race is why my Llaesnyffan has been put to eternal slumber!” Ciel, who was standing on the platform, raise his scepter, “Guards! Kill them! Do not allow them to disturb Llaesnyffan’s spirit!”</p>
 <p>Such is the way of a BOSS. It initiated the battle even before Ye Ci and Fleeting Time could reaction.</p>
 <p>With a wave of Ciel’s scepter, the row of machines that remained dormant sprung into life. A machine that stood at the far right charged at Ye Ci and Fleeting Time. The duo nodded at each other, and immediately split up while simultaneously summoning their pets and directing them at the machine. The duo then began to launch attack after attack at the machine from each side. The machine was a formidable foe far superior to its counterparts that were destroyed by Ye Ci and Fleeting Time. It immediately morphed its right arm into a chainsaw and swung its weapon at Ol’ Four.</p>
 <p>“Oh no!” Ye Ci’s heart sunk. She knew that even if the blow would not immediately kill Ol’ Four, her pet would still suffer a huge amount of damage. Ye Ci blew her whistle, intending to relay a command for Ol’ Four to retreat, but the attack connected right as the beast began to withdraw followed by a roar of pain. A gaping wound appeared on Ol’ Four’s side and blood was gushing out of the would. Ye Ci immediately cast Pet Heal at Ol’ Four, which was able to heal some of its health, but did nothing to stop the bleeding. Only a bandage or a potion could heal the wound.</p>
 <p>Despite its injuries, Ol’ Four was still an Epic-tier life form. It would not allow itself to be bullied. It pounced on the machine and landed a mighty blow on its leg with a swoop of its tail.</p>
 <p>The machine was an incomplete work that had not reached the peak of its combat strength. It had a formidable attack power, but was still lacking in defence. Ol’ Four’s attack was able to send the machine sprawling on the ground.</p>
 <p>“You take care of this one, I’ll go deploy some traps.” according to Fleeting Time’s calculation, the duo spent 40 seconds to disable the machine. Even if they were unable to destroy their opponent, it was already rendered defenseless, and the next machine in line would take 10 seconds to activate. He immediately placed traps in front of the row of machines and backed away to resume his attack on the fallen machine, which was turned into a pile of scrap metal under the relentless onslaught of the duo.</p>
 <p>Before they could have the chance to take a rest, a second machine charged at Ye Ci and Fleeting Time. It was then slowed by Fleeting Time’s trap, and the duo began showering the machines with their attacks.</p>
 <p>The Frost Trap placed by Fleeting Time served its purpose well, and the duo was able to defeat their second foe without much of a problem. The rest of Ciel’s sentries were dispatched with a similar fashion with the combined effort of Ye Ci and Fleeting Time.</p>
 <p>“You damned High Elves! You destroyed my sentries! Now I’m angry! Are you going to continue destroying my love with Llaesnyffan? Don’t even think about it! Llaesnyffan will always be my bride! She is and always will be the queen of the Goblin Kingdom! I will never allow her to return to that dirty forest of yours! This is where she belongs!” Ciel was enraged when his sentries were defeated by Ye Ci and Fleeting Time.</p>
 <p>“You’ve gone through great pains to defeat the sentries, turning them into a pile of scrap metal. Ciel is very angry. They were his proudest warriors. Ciel swore to send out his strongest warrior to vanquish you and your companions. You lifted your head… By the Gods! How can there be such a huge robot? You’re but an ant compared to the gigantic machine. Fear gripped your heart, but you’re not even given the chance to wallow in your fear. You stared at Ciel with eyes wide open. Are you going to die here today? But.. Your eyes rested on a familiar form Isn’t that De'frei, the most renowned of engineers in the entire Goblin Kingdom? You lowered your head, your mind is spinning. Perhaps he can help you in defeating that terrible monster....”</p>
 <p>“You damned Elves! You’ll pay for interrupting my reunion with Llaesnyffan! I’ll grind you all into dust! Come, my greatest warrior! Show them the meaning of terror!” Ciel shouted at the top of his lungs while the duo began strategizing for the fight ahead.</p>
 <p>“That thing is lvl65… Will we even have a 50% hit rate especially with the level penalty?” Fleeting Time furrowed his eyebrows at the giant robot.</p>
 <p>“It shouldn’t be a problem.” a lowered hit rate would definitely affect the damage output of the duo. Ye Ci was faced with an unprecedented pressure. Can we really bring this thing down?</p>
 <p>“De'frei is here.” said Fleeting Time who spotted the Goblin on top of the robot’s head. The Goblin landed softly after jumping down from the robot and ran up to Ciel. He must have an equipment with Featherfall.</p>
 <p>“Your Majesty, the Iron Warrior is not ready yet…” De'frei was distressed.</p>
 <p>With his mind set on the annihilation of Ye Ci and Fleeting Time, Ciel ignored the protest of De'frei “This is my kingdom, De'frei! I don’t care what you have to say, activate the Iron Warrior!”</p>
 <p>“But Your Majesty, if we activate the Iron Warrior now, the whole palace will collapse! It might even bring catastrophe to the entire kingdom!”</p>
 <p>“So what? My beloved Llaesnyffan is gone! I care for nothing else, I want those Elves dead! They’ve ruined my reunion with Llaesnyffan!” Ciel’s eyes were glowing red with anger.</p>
 <p>“Your Majesty…” De'frei’s pleas fell on deaf ears. Ciel raised his scepter, and fired a wave of golden energy at De'frei, tossing him aside.</p>
 <p>“Great Engineer my ass! You’re just a slave! And a slave must listen to his master!” shireked the crazed Ciel.</p>
 <p>Ye Ci ran up to De’frei who was shivering on the ground and helped him up, “Mr.De’frei, are you alright?”</p>
 <p>De’frei opened his eyes when he heard the voice of Ye Ci. His eyes slowly focused on the two figures standing in front of him. They were Hunters. Two Elven Hunters.</p>
 <p>“Ahh… So you’re an Elf.” De’frei let out a sigh. He was very old. Despite the long lives led by the Goblins, they were still a mortal race. Many of the Goblins had never even lived to see their adulthood before the end of their lives. A old Goblin like De’frei was a very rare sight, “I’ve not seen a Elf for a very long time now. Especially… A High Elf.”</p>
 <p>“Mr.De’frei, do you know of a Goblin called Orthus?” asked Ye Ci.</p>
 <p>De’frei grabbed hold of Ye Ci’s hands when he heard the name, “My dear Elf, how do you know of the name Orthus? You must tell me!”</p>
 <p>Ye Ci knew that it was not a good time for explanations. But how should I answer his question? She then thought of the Goblin Compass, maybe this will help! And she handed the Goblin Compass to De’frei, “Mr.De’frei, do you recognise this device?”</p>
 <p>“De’frei spotted! De’frei spotted!” the Goblin Compass was still beeping in De’frei’s grip…</p>
