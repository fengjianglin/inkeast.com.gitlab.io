 <p><strong>Chapter 220 First Battle in Golan Arena (Part 2)</strong></p>
 <p>Ye Ci walked up to the NPC in charge of the arena with a darkened expression. Her mood was ruined by all the players crowding around her, and intention of joining a decent party was long gone; She immediately selected the option to randomize her party, and was transported into the arena.</p>
 <p>Disappointed groans and jeers rang out all around the entrance of the arena when Ye Ci disappeared from view.</p>
 <p>Of course, Ye Ci was not able to hear the commotion, which would definitely further ruin her mood. She had always preferred to keep a low profile, and being the focus of attention was a horrifying experience.</p>
 <p>“Aiya, somebody joined our party! We can stop recruiting new members now.” Ye Ci heard a loli voice the moment she joined the party.</p>
 <p>“It took such a long time for someone to join our party! Are there really so few fighting in the arena these days?” said the voice of another loli.</p>
 <p>“I don’t think that’s the case. It definitely has something to do with our low tier equipment. Nobody wants to team up with us.”</p>
 <p>“Aiya, didn’t someone just join our party? Let’s go and have a look!”</p>
 <p>“Save it, it’s probably a newbie…”</p>
 <p>Ye Ci was transported into a small room decorated with some small barrels and a few broken chairs. She could hear voices coming from a nearby room. The house that Ye Ci was in served as the spawn point for her party.</p>
 <p>Ye Ci’s first action when arriving in an unfamiliar place was to have a look at the map. She closed the map window after studying the map for a brief moment and began walking to join up with her party members in the next room. Even for a random battle in the arena, Ye Ci felt the need to show courtesy her teammates in a 5v5 battle, and talk to them about their battle strategy.</p>
 <p>But just as Ye Ci had closed her map, four Gnomes appeared in front of her, staring at her with mouths wide open.</p>
 <p>Elves were considered tall among the many races in Fate. Despite her average height, Ye Ci was considerably taller than the Gnomes.</p>
 <p>This made the situation slightly awkward for Ye Ci.</p>
 <p>An Elf standing in front of four Gnomes was such a sharp contrast that the situation itself became a source of laughter. Ye Ci felt as if she was inspecting her troops before a battle. This… This is just…</p>
 <p><em>So what should I do?</em> Thought Ye Ci to herself after a half a minute of silence. While she was still pondering over this quandary, one of the Gnomes to her left cried out in a loud voice, “Wow! Your clothes are pretty!”</p>
 <p>The three other Gnomes began voicing out their thoughts out loud as well.</p>
 <p>“Wow! What a tall Elf!”</p>
 <p>“Wow! She looks like a high-leveled player!”</p>
 <p>“Wow! She looks so cool!”</p>
 <p>The corners of Ye Ci’s mouth twitched. <em>Just what the hell is this?</em> She had just escaped the misfortune of becoming a living exhibit at the entrance of Golan Arena just to suffer the same fate in the arena. Fortunately for Ye Ci, the Gnomes did not comment on her identity as Gongzi You.</p>
 <p>“So what’s the plan?” Ye Ci cleared her throat.</p>
 <p>However, her words fell on deaf ears. The four Gnomes shared confused looks with each other, and stared at Ye Ci. “She seems to be… Gongzi You.” said one of the Gnomes after a long moment of silence.</p>
 <p>“Yeah, she does look like Gongzi you…”</p>
 <p>“No! She really is Gongzi You!”</p>
 <p>“Gongzi You joined our party?!”</p>
 <p>“I’m gonna take a picture of her.”</p>
 <p>“I know, right! I’m going to upload it to the forums! This is just insane! We made the right choice by coming to the arena today!”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>The Gnomes immediately began to holler in excitement. Ye Ci could even feel her temple twitching. “So… What’s the plan?” asked Ye Ci as the Gnomes began to quiet down.</p>
 <p>“Plan?” the leader of the party, Little Seven, blinked rapidly, as if Ye Ci’s question was an impossible riddle “What plan?”</p>
 <p>“How are we going to fight when the battle starts?” Ye Ci was assaulted by a headache. Was she the one at fault here? Or was the Gnome’s comprehension skill to be blamed?</p>
 <p>“We’re just here for the points. There’s no need for plan.” a Gnome with the name Little Rabbit blinked at Ye Ci.</p>
 <p>“So… You’re one of those ‘free-win teams’…” Ye Ci immediately regretted her decision to join a random team that was hastily made when she was surrounded by players at the entrance of Golan Arena. She would suffer losses in terms of Battle Point if she left the party, which was not an issue under normal circumstances. However, Ye Ci had no Battle Points as this was her first visit to the Golan Arena. In such a situation, she was not allowed to leave.</p>
 <p>In other words, Ye Ci was forced to take part in her first battle in the Golan Arena with the four Gnomes serving as a great burden. Tears welled up in her eyes. <em>Why is this happening to me?</em></p>
 <p>“Yup! Don’t worry, it’s good to be part of a free-win team. You can earn Battle Points, and your matches end quickly. If we had higher levels, we’d run into a lot of win trading teams.” said another Gnome.She blinked at Ye Ci as well, and despite the Gnome’s cute and innocent appearance, her words almost brought Ye Ci into tears.</p>
 <p>“Doesn’t it mean that you’re losing without putting up a fight?” Ye Ci creased her eyebrows. This was never her way of doing things. She was a person who would struggle even at the face of certain defeat. There was no such thing as “giving up” in Ye Ci’s dictionary.</p>
 <p>“What do you mean? You’re thinking too much. We’re just here for the Battle Points. Is there even a need to try so hard?” another Gnome, Lil' Handsome, spoke up. Perhaps due to their racial trait, each of the Gnomes would blink before they spoke to Ye Ci. It was as if she was surrounded by a group of adorable creatures trying to act cute.</p>
 <p>“....” Ye Ci gave up on all attempts to communicate with the Gnomes.<em> If they keep this up, I’m going to die of anger</em>. She stared at expressionlessly at the Gnomes, “So who is the party leader? Go initiate the battle.”</p>
 <p>Lil' Handsome was astonished by Ye Ci’s response “Eh? So you agree to give out a free win?” asked the Gnome as he began unequipping her equipment. The other Gnomes had also unequipped their equipment at astonishing speed.</p>
 <p>They stared at Ye Ci as they stood in nothing but their undergarments, “Are you sure you’re not going to unequip your gear? They seem to be some pretty high level equipment. If you die, repairing those equipment is going to cost you a fortune.”</p>
 <p>“I have no habit of doing such a thing” said Ye Ci in a low voice, with her expression darkened.</p>
 <p>“Ahh…” <em>Well, she’s Gongzi You after all. Nobody can force her to do anything. Sigh, as expected of an expert. The cost of repairing her equipment means nothing to her.</em> Thought Lil' Handsome as he initiated the battle.</p>
 <p>Ye Ci immediately entered Stealth when the battle started and hid herself in a spot near the entrance of the house.</p>
 <p>As the house was built on a hill with its back to a steep cliff, Ye Ci’s position near the entrance provided her with an excellent field of vision and a good defensive position.</p>
 <p>The enemy would definitely be quick to realise that Ye Ci’s party was a free-win team due to their inaction. With that, they would be forced to make a move. In a situation where the enemy’s strength was unknown, Ye Ci would never act rashly. Even if it was might not be hard to take on five opponents at once, she still had a chance of losing against her opponents if they were able to work together properly.</p>
 <p>Such was the beauty of teamwork.</p>
 <p>This was also why Ye Ci immediately considered leaving the party when she first learned that it was a free-win team.</p>
 <p>Waiting was not in Ye Ci’s nature. She had always preferred to be on the move. However, with the four Gnomes that were a heavy burden to her, she could only wait.</p>
 <p>As expected, the enemy team was quick to realise that their opponent was a free-win team, and immediately approached the house. A battle in the Golan Arena lasted only for five minutes. The team that was able to secure the most kills during the give minutes will be declared as the victor. Battle Points will then be awarded to the players. The winners will then receive bonus for their victory, and awarded points based on the amount of kills, healing or other stats.</p>
 <p>Of course, a free-win team would still receive a miniscule amount of Battle Points for their participation. Given enough time, the players could still accumulate enough points for better equipment. Although many of the players preferred to gain Battle Points by slaying their opponents in the Golan Arena, a tiny amount of them could only resort to forming free-win teams due to their lack of skill, teamwork, and equipment.</p>
 <p>Ye Ci’s Gnomish teammates were examples of such players.</p>
 <p>A torrent of voices entered Ye Ci’s ears. Her opponents were speaking in the language of their own continent, which due to the game system, were utterly incomprehensible to Ye Ci.</p>
 <p>The first player to approach the house was a Rogue. He crept up to the house in stealth mode, and jumped in through a window. After doing a quick survey of his surroundings, the Rogue began talking to his teammates. Four more players appeared near the house, while the Rogue walked up to the four Gnomes.</p>
 <p>The Gnomes were very calm. It was apparent that they were very used to such a situation. They did not even blink at the face of death. However, the act of waiting for death’s approach was like an unforgivable sin to Ye Ci. She circled to the Rogue’s back, took aim at him, and fired off her skills. The Rogue could not even react in time. With a loud shriek, he fell lifelessly onto the ground.</p>
 <p>It was clear that the players outside of the house received a warning from their fallen comrade. They began spreading out in an attempt to encircle the house. However, they were still too late. After dispatching the Rogue, Ye Ci immediately cast Rain of Arrows on the rest of his team. Arrows rained down on the four players, followed by a sea of red damage indicator and the panicked cries of the players.</p>
 <p>Ye Ci’s mechanical skills, game sense, and PVP experience were not the only contributing factors to her quick victories. Her level and equipment played an important role in the battle as well. She was 20 levels ahead of the other players, and their equipment was at least five tiers lower than Ye Ci’s Marshal Set. They were wiped out within seconds without putting much of a fight.</p>
 <p>Of course, this came as a surprise to Ye Ci’s opponents as well. They had never expected such a strong opponent that could easily wipe their team out. After a brief discussion, the team opted to stay still after their respawn.</p>
 <p>On Ye Ci’s side of the map, the Gnomes did not expect Ye Ci to emerge victorious after taking on their opponents alone. They stood around Ye CI and chatted away with delight clear on their faces.</p>
 <p>“Just leave them to me. I want you to remain hidden and stay safe.” said Ye Ci, who could no longer stand the chatter. She jumped out of the room and headed straight for the enemy’s side of the map.</p>
 <p>The spawn point of Ye Ci’s opponents shared the same setting as the spawn point of her team. It was a location that could easily guard against an attack. However, there was a ladder attached the the side of the house that can be used by players to enter the house. Ye Ci entered stealth and crept slowly up the ladder before finally entering the house. Instead of the ambush that Ye Ci expected, she was greeted by the following scene:</p>
 <p>Five players were laying on the floor of the small house with their equipment removed.</p>
 <p>Their expressions were calm and collected, and it was apparent that they have given up on making any moves.</p>
 <p>Ye Ci was dumbfounded by the sight, “You’re giving away a free win?” asked Ye Ci in a common language shared by all the continents.</p>
 <p>The Undead Rogue who was the closest to Ye Ci stood up and nodded at her, “Well, with an opponent like you around, there’s nothing much that we can do…”</p>
 <p>What the heck?</p>
 <p>Ye Ci rolled her eyes.</p>
 <p>“Just kill us already, Gongzi You. You can at least earn more Battle Points from the kills. Time is nearly up.” said a Lycan Warrior to his opponent that was much more stronger than him. However, his reminder that was spoken out of kindness was like an insult to Ye Ci, who muttered a string of curses under her breath before leaving the house.</p>
 <p>“Are you not going to kill us?” asked an Elven Cleric who was baffled by Ye Ci’s inaction.</p>
 <p>“I’ve already killed you anyways. I’ve already won.” Ye Ci gritted her teeth.</p>
 <p>“We’re giving you free points…”</p>
 <p>“I’m not interested in prey that readily offers itself up.” said Ye Ci as she left the house. The battle ended before she could return to her spawn point. The winner of the battle would of course be Ye Ci’s party. Each member was awarded with 200 Battle Points for their victory, while Ye Ci received an additional 150 bonus points for her kills.</p>
 <p>However, Ye Ci did not rejoice in this victory, and was instead seething in anger.</p>
 <p>She silently swore to herself that her next battle would be a massacre.</p>
