 <p>Chapter 397 Meeting Andriel Again</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This scene was so familiar to Ye Ci. As she clutched on the steering and appeared to be driving calmly on the surface, many things were going on in Ye Ci’s head. She could vividly remember driving with Bai Mo in her last life as well.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The two of them were having a conversation just like this, but it was less peaceful. It ended with Bai Mo leaving, and her returning to Wandering Clouds.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>And the next time they drove together, Ye Ci was pushing the pedal to the metal, while Bai Mo was trying his best to stop her. It ended with…&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Ci sighed.&nbsp;<em>Thank God I’m able to start things over again.</em> This was why she treasured Bai Mo’s opinion a lot. No matter what he said, she would consider it, instead of going into an argument with him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“What are you thinking about?” Bai Mo bit into another steamed bun. It was apparent that he was starving.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“What do you mean what I’m thinking about?” Ye Ci’s head was a jumbled mess. She could not comprehend Bai Mo’s question.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Bai Mo cast a glance at Ye Ci and saw her expression as she focused on the road. She was genuinely confused by the question, “Why was he here?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It was a question that Ye Ci had pondered. But truth to be told, she did not know the answer. She wanted to ask the same question to Yi QIngchen as well, but… She forgot to ask.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Damn it! Why did I forget such an important question!</em> She did not even know how to begin to answer his question, “Well, he and Polang knew each other for a long time. It’s not harad for him to know where we live. But… I don’t know how he got here, and why he did it.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Bai Mo raised an eyebrow at Ye Ci. He patted her on the head and a smile appeared on his lips, “What do you think of Fleeting Time?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This was the second time someone asked such a question. But Ye Ci would never lie to Bai Mo, nor would she give him an answer that was only half the truth. She drove in silence in heavy traffic. The traffic eventually bogged down due to the large number of cars on the road. But this gave Ye Ci a chance to seriously ponder the question.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I think he’s just like a child.” replied Ye Ci after a long moment of silence, “He likes to waste his time on insignificant problems, is very possessive, willful, and would never give up on the things he wants, just like a child would. I’ve always wondered how he managed to survive growing up.” she then turned around to face Bai Mo, “Don’t you think so? He has a lower EQ than even I do. How can he grow up safely like that? Is it because of his luck?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Bai Mo blinked with confusion, there was disbelief in his voice, “Say, are we talking about the same person.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Huh?” Ye Ci looked at Bai Mo, “What do you mean we’re not talking about the same person?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“The Fleeting Time you just described is not the Fleeting Time I know,” said Bai Mo.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“The Fleeting TIme you know?” Ye Ci parotted his words, “Then what is the Fleeting Time you know life?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“He won’t behave like a child. He is calm, rational, cunning, and overall a monster. Why does he sound so different from your perspective?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“There’s no way we got the wrong person. Tan Polang knew him in real life.” Ye Ci was confused.&nbsp;<em>There’s no way we’re mistaken right? Is Yi Qingchen not Fleeting Time?</em>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Bai Mo broke out into laughter, as if he had just heard the best joke in the world.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Ci was very confused.&nbsp;<em>Did I say something wrong just now?</em> She thought long and hard,&nbsp;<em>I did not say anything funny. Why is he laughing?&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Bai Mo held back his laughter when he saw Ye Ci’s confused expression. He took in a deep breath to calm himself down, but there was still a wide grin on his face, “A man would only behave like a child towards a woman he loves.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It was Ye Ci’s turn to blink in confusion, “You’re saying that…”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I’m not saying anything.” Bai Mo faced away from Ye Ci, “Little Ci, you know the answer to your own question. You don’t have to ask me.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Ci creased her eyebrows, and muttered to herself before asking, “Do you think Fleeting TIme is a bad person?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“How do I say this…” Bai Mo tilted his head, “I think he’s a normal human being just like you and me. There are good things about him, and of course, there’s bound to be bad sides to him too.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Ci pursed her lips. She did not get the answer she wanted. She stepped lightly on the accelerator when the car in front finally moved forward. A sigh escaped her mouth. She wanted to know from Bai Mo if Fleeting Time was worth her commitment, but the question refused to leave her mouth.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Bai Mo was right. She knew the answer. There was no need to ask him about it.&nbsp;<em>But what about Wandering Clouds? Bai Mo objected to our relationship back then. What will he do in this life?</em>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Her relationship with Wandering Clouds was a trauma that had haunted her for a long time. It made her very timid when she had to face Fleeting Time.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Bai Mo could understand how Ye Ci felt. He stared silently at her before finally speaking up, “I have a feeling that he’s a very responsible person. While he can be childish at times, he’s still a very mature person. He’ll make a good partner for you in life.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Ci kept her eyes on the road, but her mind was filled with the times she spent with Fleeting Time. She let out a sigh after a very long time.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>While Bai Mo was silent as if he had already fallen asleep, he was still conscious. He sighed internally.&nbsp;<em>It seems that daughters are bound to leave their families once they grow older. She’s no longer the snotty little brat who used to follow me around. I can’t protect her forever.&nbsp;</em>He understood that one day a man would appear to take over his role as Ye Ci’s protector. A feeling of sadness filled his heart, as if someone had snatched his precious daughter away from him.&nbsp;<em>Damn you, Fleeting Time. I’ll not let you off the hook that easily.&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Spring Festival gave a large amount of high quality equipment to the players. These equipment could only be crafted if not for the event. And it was not an easy task.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But thanks to the new equipment, the major guilds in the game were able to increase their efficiency in dungeon clearing. Many of the BOSSes that had become obstacles to their progress were defeated with relative ease.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Upwards Ho! had been busy with dungeon clearing as well. Due to its rapid growth, the guild was now considered a medium sized guild. Its members might not be as numerous as the likes of Golden Era, but the due to its preference for quality over quantity, it was still a very competent guild&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Many of Upwards Ho!’s players were skillful and well equipped. They could easily make up for their lack in numbers with the quality of their players. The guild had even organized its players into groups that would scour dungeons and farm equipment from the arena to raise their fighting capabilities.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Ci, on the other hand, had been busy exploring the Kira Mountain Range. Perhaps due to the luck of the Spring Festival, she was able to locate the shrine once again. And after a short exploration, she was able to completely master the terrain in the mountain range. No matter where she was, she could easily navigate her way to the shrine.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The bow was still held by the statue of the Goddess of Nature, which was in turn protected by a barrier. Despite her best attempts, Ye Ci could not find a way to unlock the barrier. She had to return to Natasha, but the NPC was of no help as well.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But she received a hint from Natasha. She was told that the warriors who accompanied Dau’er in his fight against Naga might know of the barrier’s secrets.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>And Ye Ci knew of a survivor of the war. It was Andriel who was now a ghost.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She once again returned to the Swamps of Despair.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The area was still devoid of players, and even Ye Ci herself was barely able to make the journey due to her stealth capabilities. The swamp was still guarded by the spirits of the dead.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Ci shivered as a gust of cold wind blew past her. She carefully made her way to Andriel’s grave, careful to avoid detection by the wandering Undead around her.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It sounded simple, but was no easy task. She was sweating from exertion by the time she arrived by Andriel’s grave.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She surveyed her surroundings while remaining in stealth. A passing Banshee turned its head towards her, and she held her breath. She was among one of the highest level players, but her level was still nothing compared to the monsters in the map. A single glancing blow would be able to take her life.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Banshee’s hollow eyes remained fixed on Ye Ci’s position for a few agonizing seconds before it floated away. Ye Ci let out a sigh of relief and extended her hand towards Andriel’s grave.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A puff of green smoke appeared and took a humanoid shape. It was Andriel.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The deceased Elf stretched his body and took in a deep breath, “I felt a friend calling for me. Let’s see who is here,” he lowered himself and smiled when he saw Ye Ci, “Oh, it’s you, young Elf. It has been a long time.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“It has indeed, Andriel.” Ye Ci bowed at the Elf.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“How’s Tamra?” Andriel smiled at Ye Ci. He was in a great mood.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Despite his experiences that were filled with tragedy, the Elf was indeed in a good mood.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Ci hesitated to tell him the truth, but Andriel could sense that something was amidst, “What is wrong, my young kinsman? Why are you hesitating?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Andriel, your friend Tamra has arrived at our homeland.” Ye Ci finally broke the news to the Elf.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Andriel was momentarily stunned. He was quick to understand the words. Sorrow washed over him, but he swiftly recovered from his feeling of woe, “That’s good. We both yearned to return to our homeland. At least he was able to return.”&nbsp;</p>
