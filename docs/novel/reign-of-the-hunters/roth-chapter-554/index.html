 <p>Chapter 456 And What Does It Have To Do With Me?</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Alright, I’ll stay away from you if you want, I’ll leave you alone if that’s what you wish, as long as you’d stop ignoring me.” Mo Leng immediately retracted her hand. She took a step back and stood silently beside Fleeting Time.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Her eyes were moist with tears, while her nose was red and puffy. From the reflection of her in the mirror, it appeared as though she was the victim.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Fleeting Time grew even more annoyed at that sight. He turned around and stared at Mo Leng.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The girl immediately met his gaze, but anxiety slowly crept into her heart. Unlike the usual disdain and contempt in Fleeting Time’s eyes, what she saw was an empty gaze devoid of even the slightest emotion.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This sent a chill down her spine. She had grown so used to his anger that the sudden calmness was highly unusual. The man’s negative emotions towards her was something she could bear, but the lack of emotion was something she feared.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Qing Chen…” Yi Qingchen did not move. Even Mo Leng herself did not know how long it had been, but multiple individuals had already gone into and left the washroom, but he was still staring at her like a lifeless statue.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Panic was the only thing in Mo Leng’s heart at the moment. She reached out to Yi Qingchen, who took a step back. His simple gesture struck a blow on her heart like a hammer, “Please don’t be like that…”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“What do you want, Mo Leng.” Fleeting Time took in a deep breath and let out a long sigh. His voice was calm. There was not a hint of anger as he spoke. In fact, there was no emotion at all.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You know what I want, Qing Chen.” breathed Mo Leng, “My heart has never changed since the first time we met. You know that!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“If an answer is what you want from me, I think you should know what it is. It has remained the same since the moment we met.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“How could you! The only thing I want is a chance! A chance to prove myself to you! I’ll never lose to anyone! You don’t even have to do anything! All I ask for is a chance, for me and for yourself.” Mo Leng took in a deep breath, “I know that my persistence had been meaningless, annoying even. But I like you, and only you.” she then shook her head, “No, I love you.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“...ten men walk into a bar, seven are foolish, eight are stupid, and nine are bad, but one of them are loved by all, come sisters…” Fruit Jelly and Fang Susu were dancing along to their favourite song, as if they were best friends of many years.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Many of the bachelors were howling with sadness, “I’m that man that everyone loves! Come and get me!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Yup! No one wants you! You’ll not be wanted for the rest of your lives!” Ideal Height 1.7m was laughing along with Ye Ci who was leaning against her knees. She stood up with a quick movement and snatched the mic away from Fruit Jelly, “I’ll sing the next chorus, gimme that thing.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Fruit Jelly returned to her seat and gulped down a few mouthfuls of beer to soothe her dry throat, “Why don’t you go up and sing as well?” she asked Ye Ci.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“The tempo is too fast for me.” Ye Ci shook her head with a smile. Despite what she said, she was humming along with the song.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Say, isn’t your Fleeting Time that man who is loved by all?” Fruit Jelly chuckled.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Who knows?” Ye Ci rolled her eyes.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Aiya! I just remembered something!” Fruit Jelly exclaimed, “I saw Fleeting Time by the basin as I went to the washroom.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Ci’s gaze remained on the screen.&nbsp;<em>Well everyone needs a washroom break.&nbsp;</em>She grunted a response, as it was something very normal.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Hey hey, come on now, I don’t think he was there to use the washroom though. His hair and clothes were soaked. He looks pretty angry too. He might’ve gotten into a fight. Are you sure you don’t want to go and see what’s going on?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Is he hurt?” Ye Ci raised an eyebrow at Fruit Jelly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I don’t think so, but he looked like he was ready to murder someone. Do you think I’m crazy enough to stare at him for so long?” Fruit Jelly gulped down another mouthful of beer, “Go! Find out what happened!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“There’s nothing to see. If he gets into a fight, the police will handle it.” Ye Ci mumbled a response. She wanted to go, but was simply too shy to leave.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Fruit Jelly rolled her eyes at Ye Ci, “Fine! He bailed you out yesterday, I guess you can call it even by bailing him out later.” she continued, “Oh, wait, you were there to help in an investigation, but he’s involved in a brawl. You can’t even bail him out.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She clapped Ye Ci on the back when she saw her friend fidgeting around on her seat, “Are you not going to the toilet? You’ve drank a lot!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A large number of the players present heard Fruit Jelly. They snickered at Ye Ci, who stood up to leave.&nbsp;<em>Damn it Fruit Jelly! You came back ages ago! Even if he’s there he would’ve been long gone! Why are you doing this to me?&nbsp;</em>Ye Ci grumbled as she made her way to the washroom.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She could hear voices before even reaching the basin area.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It was rude to eavesdrop on a conversation, but Ye Ci did not know why she hid in a corner. She was cursing at herself.&nbsp;<em>What are you doing! Really? You’re eavesdropping on them right now?</em> Just when she finally made the decision to walk out from her hiding spot, a familiar voice entered her ears, “If an answer is what you want from me, I think you should know what it is. It has remained the same since the moment we met.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Ci perched her ears.&nbsp;<em>I’ve heard something that’s not meant for me.&nbsp;</em>Her curiosity had gotten the better of her. “Your Fleeting Time is that man who everyone loves.” Fruit Jelly’s voice rang in her ears the moment she heard the three words leaving Mo Leng’s mouth.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Yes. He is.</em> Thought Ye Ci.&nbsp;<em>Hold on a moment, shouldn’t I be saying something here? Maybe I should at least feel a little hurt? No? Okay then.&nbsp;</em>She did not find herself affected by it at all.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“And then what?” came Fleeting Time’s voice just as Ye Ci was contemplating if she was a cold hearted person.&nbsp;<em>Oi!</em> She stifled a laugh,&nbsp;<em>Didn’t you just get confessed to? Shouldn’t you like… Show more emotion?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Of course, Ye Ci was not the only one who was rendered speechless by the three words. Mo Leng was on the verge of crying. She gave herself a few moments to regain her composure before squeezing out the words, “Since that’s the case, I hope you can give me the chance to be your girlfriend. I will prove to you that I’m better than Gongzi You.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“And then what?” Fleeting Time repeated the same three words.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Gongzi You is indeed strong. But Qing Chen, a strong woman like her, is incapable of making compromises. You’re just like her. Don’t you think that conflict will arise between you two as time goes on? Won’t it be tiring to be in a relationship like this? Why not give me a chance? I’m not saying that you have to choose me. But give me a chance, and give yourself a chance. You can reject me, but please, not after giving me the chance to prove myself. You’re a smart man. Surely you know what’s best for you.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Why is that?” Fleeting Time remained emotionless.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It took Mo Leng quite some moment to regain her composure from yet another blow, “Because I love you.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“And what does it have to do with me?”&nbsp;</p>
