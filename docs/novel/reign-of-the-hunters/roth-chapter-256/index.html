 <p><strong>Chapter 222 What a Shitty Decision (Part 2) </strong></p>
 <p>The three male players of the party were dumbfounded by Glistening Moonlight’s remark. As one, they decided to ignore her words and continued watching the battle.</p>
 <p>Even without the attention from her party members, Glistening Moonlight was still able to gossipping. She began taking screenshots of the battle, and even started to record the entire scene.</p>
 <p>Glistening Moonlight let out a loud scream when Fleeting Time fell onto the ground with Ye Ci. Her face was blushing with a deep shade of red as she gasp for air. Some might even have the impression that she have done some indecent things.</p>
 <p>“It’s so exciting! It’s just so exciting! Fleeting Time! Why don’t you just push Gongzi You down? Ahhhh!!! Gongzi You, you can be a little more forceful as well!” Glistening Moonlight was ecstatic. The two combatants were oblivious to her words due to the distance.</p>
 <p>Unlike their audience who were enjoying the show, Ye Ci and Fleeting Time were exhausted as they lay gasping for air on the ground.</p>
 <p>Despite lasting for mere minutes, the two felt as if the battle has been going on for years.</p>
 <p>“There’s 40 seconds left, do you want to continue our fight?” Fleeting Time smiled at Ye Ci after stealing a glance at the timer.</p>
 <p>“Like I said, I’m going to kill you.” said Ye Ci in a hoarse voice, her throat was burning with thirst.</p>
 <p>“Yup, yup.” Fleeting Time nodded as he smiled coyly at Ye Ci, “I’ve even remember something you said a long time ago, ‘You bastard, I’m going to kill you until your level hits 0!’. Is today the day?”</p>
 <p>The corners of Ye Ci’s mouth twitched as she noticed the smile on Fleeting Time’s face. The urge to stomp down hard on his face boiled within her. For reasons unknown, running into Fleeting Time would always have an effect on her. It was as if she had lost all her abilities to speak. The man seemed to have a talent of driving someone to die of anger. He was even making fun of her with her own words, and it was driving Ye Ci mad.</p>
 <p>Fleeting Time shrugged after he was met with silence from Ye Ci, “Alright, even if it’s a pleasure to have you kill me, we don’t seem to have enough time.” said Fleeting Time as he eyed the match timer. There were only a few seconds left. He then said with a smile, “Why don’t we head into a 1v1 room? We fight all we want.”</p>
 <p>We can fight all we want. The proposal was undoubtedly very tempting to Ye Ci. However, after a moment of thought, Ye Ci concluded that the odds were against her in a fight against Fleeting Time. She was not in her top condition, and was even feeling very tired.</p>
 <p>“Are you giving me your silent consent? Or are you ignoring me?” Fleeting Time continued to stare at Ye Ci with a smile on his face. His mood was very good. It did not matter if Ye Ci declined his proposal. He enjoyed staring at her angry face.</p>
 <p>Ye Ci glared at Fleeting Time, “Hey, do you know that you’re very annoying?”</p>
 <p>“I know. Aren’t you telling me that right now?” Fleeting Time nodded, giving Ye Ci his full cooperation.</p>
 <p>“You…” Ye Ci was annoyed by Fleeting Time’s response. She glared at him, and then at Fleeting Time’s hand that was still holding on to her ankle, and her temper soared. She kicked away Fleeting Time’s hand and stood up.</p>
 <p>Just then, the system announced the end of the better, and Ye Ci’s party was declared the victors. Before she could leave the party, Fleeting Time called out to her, “Little Gongzi!”</p>
 <p><em>What the hell?</em></p>
 <p><em>Little Gongzi?</em></p>
 <p>Even the corners of Ye Ci’s eyes began to twitch as she heard the nickname given to her. She glared at Fleeting Time and shouted out loud, “I’m Gongzi You! Not Little Gongzi!”</p>
 <p>“I know, I know. But Little Gongzi, we’ve known each other for quite some times now. Don’t you think that we should not fight each other every time we meet?” Fleeting Time stood up and dusted his clothes. He was not affected at all by Ye Ci’s apparent anger.</p>
 <p>“I can’t think of anything else to do to a player from an opposing continent. Do you expect me to drink some wine with you?” Ye Ci sneered codly as she crossed her arms in front of her chest. She was bemused by the seemingly stupid suggestion by Fleeting Time.</p>
 <p>Fleeting Time, however, appeared to be considering the option seriously. He then nodded and walked up to Ye Ci with a smile on his face, “Aiya, this is a splendid suggestion!”</p>
 <p>“What?” Ye Ci raised her eyebrows, <em>since when have I made such a suggestion?</em></p>
 <p>“Alright, it’s decided then.” said Fleeting Time with a snap of his fingers. The smile was still on his face as he leaned closer to Ye Ci. He was so close that she could feel her warm breath on her face, “Let’s have another duel the next time we meet. If I win, I’ll buy you a drink.”</p>
 <p><em>What a shitty decision!</em> thought Ye Ci to herself. However, there was another issue that was more important at that moment, “What do you mean by ‘if you win’? Let me tell you something, Fleeting Time! You’re going to die by my hands!”</p>
 <p>Fleeting Time nodded and let out a sigh. He patted Ye Ci on her head, earning him a smack from ye Ci’s sword. He immediately retracted his hand, “Well, if you insist, you can try your best to defeat me the next time we meet. And after that… Well, perhaps we can have a drink.”</p>
 <p>“I’m definitely going to beat you.” Ye Ci was infuriated by Fleeting Time’s indifferent attitude. <em>Can he not be such an asshole?</em></p>
 <p>“Fine, fine. You’re going to beat me.” Fleeting Time narrowed his eyes and said with a charming smile on his face, “Alright then. Little Gongzi, let’s have a drink together sometime.” said Fleeting Time as he turned around and left with a wave of his hand.</p>
 <p>Ye Ci stared at the waving had of Fleeting Time for a brief moment before she was hit by a sudden realization. She seemed to have overlooked something important.</p>
 <p><em>What did that bastard say again? Have a drink with him? My ass!</em></p>
 <p>Ye Ci could feel blood flooding his face. She could still feel the lingering warmth of Fleeting Time’s breath on her face, and her ears was still filled with his cheerful voice. Ye Ci stared at the silhouette of Fleeting Time as she trembled with anger, “Fleeting Time! You bastard!” shouted Ye Ci after a long moment.</p>
 <p>“Until next time, Little Gongzi!” Fleeting Time was in a very good mood. He paid no heed to Gongzi You’s insult as he waved goodbye to her.</p>
 <p>It was time for them to be transported out of the arena.</p>
 <p>A bright flash of white light erupted in Ye Ci’s vision as soon as Fleeting Time finished his sentence, and she was transported back to the main hall. She stood motionlessly for a long moment. There was a heavy weight crushing down on her chest. She was irritated. She was very irritated.</p>
 <p><em>Since when do I, Ye Ci, have to bear with something like this?</em></p>
 <p>If anybody else attempted to pull such a stunt on Ye Ci, she would definitely tear him into shreds. However, Fleeting Time was the person who was causing no end of trouble for her, and she was not capable to doing such a thing to him. Is there something more despicable than that?</p>
 <p>Of course, Gongzi You’s did not appear in the arena’s main hall for a beauty contest. She was there for a fight. After admiring Gongzi You’s presence for some moments, many of the players began to realize a very important fact: Won’t we be invincible if we team up with Gongzi You?</p>
 <p>Thus, Ye Ci was beset on all side by players who sought to invite her into their parties, “Gongzi You, do you want to join my party? We need a DPS player.”</p>
 <p>“Gongzi You, join us, our members are quite skillful. If you’re with us, we’ll definitely break the highest record of consecutive wins!”</p>
 <p>“Join our party, Gongzi You! We’ve won 23 matches in a row!”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>The commotion caused by the players was like oil that was being poured onto the raging flames of anger in Ye Ci’s heart. “I’m sorry, but I’m done for today.”</p>
 <p>With that, Ye Ci left the main hall of the arena.</p>
 <p>The players immediately broke out into a heated conversation.</p>
 <p>“Wow! Did you guys noticed Gongzi You’s expression? Did she lost her last match badly?”</p>
 <p>“I don’t think so. There’s no way a party that she’s in will lose.”</p>
 <p>“Who knows. It might not because of the result of the match. What if she had a fall out with someone in the party?”</p>
 <p>“Why don’t we just ask in the World Channel? There’s no point making wild guesses anyways.”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>The players’ actions were swift and decisive. Turmoil immediately erupted in the World Channel just a few moments after Ye Ci left the main hall.</p>
 <p>“I saw Gongzi You leaving the arena with a very sour expression. Did she lose her match or something?”</p>
 <p>“Where’s Gongzi You now?”</p>
 <p>“In Red Lake City. A lot of us saw her…”</p>
 <p>“What do you mean Gongzi You lost? She was in our party just now! We won alright!”</p>
 <p>“Wahh! The implicated party is talking! Come on, tell us the truth, did Gongzi You get into an argument with someone?”</p>
 <p>“Nope, stop spreading lies. Gongzi You is a very good person.”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>The discussion immediately flooded the already bustling World Channel with messages.</p>
 <p>“Why would she be mad? She took us out before we even know what’s happening! What are you sorry lots from the Eastern Continent crying for?” a message full of anger from a Western Continent appeared in the midst of the heated discussion.</p>
 <p>“Oh, there’s more news!”</p>
 <p>With people asking questions and their questions getting answered, players from all four continents began to pay attention to the discussion. Many of the players who loved gossipping immediately dove into the discussion. After all, nobody would want to miss out on such a good opportunity on gossipping.</p>
 <p>The Western Continent player immediately pointed out that Fleeting Time was in his party. This immediately became the center of attention of the gossipping players. Even with the relationship between Fleeting Time and Gongzi You unknown to 99.99% of the players, they have all seen the conversation between Fleeting Time and Gongzi You in the World Channel during the Western Continent’s invasion of the Eastern Continent.</p>
 <p>People immediately began making the connection between the fight in the arena and Gongzi You’s darkened expression as she left the main hall. Different theories and scandals began surfacing among the players.</p>
 <p>As the saying goes, “the world is an interesting place with you around”.</p>
 <p>On this particular day in Fate, the world was made interesting because of the players’ visualization of the interaction between Gongzi You and Fleeting TIme.</p>
 <p>Fleeting Time, however, chose to remain silent in the World Channel, and Ye Ci was absent from the channel as well. The reason was simple: They were not even paying attention to the World Channel.</p>
 <p>Of course, it did not mean that people around them were not paying attention to the World Channel.</p>
 <p>Absalom immediately walked up to Fleeting Time who had just walked into their guild encampment with a cheerful expression, “I see that you’re in a fine mood today.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, indeed.” replied Fleeting Time with a chuckle.</p>
 <p>“I saw the thing going on in the World Channel.”</p>
 <p>“The World Channel?” Fleeting Time was puzzled, “What’s with the World Channel?”</p>
 <p>“You went to the arena just now?”</p>
 <p>“Yup.”</p>
 <p>“You lost?”</p>
 <p>“That’s right.”</p>
 <p>“And you ran into Gongzi You?”</p>
 <p>“Eh? How do you even know about that?” Fleeting Time stared at Absalom incredulously. The man was beginning to show his talent as a top-tier gosipper.</p>
 <p>“How did I know? It’s all over the World Channel!” Absalom chuckled, “Based on your unhealthy hobby of treating Gongzi You in a particular way… You’ve been teasing her again?”</p>
 <p>Fleeting Time narrowed his eyes at Absalom. He was annoyed. And his annoyance was growing with each second he stared at the man’s face.</p>
 <p>“I was right, aren’t I?” asked Absalom with a mischievous smile. However, in the next moment, Fleeting Time took a swing at his nose, and he immediately saw stars in his vision.</p>
 <p>“I am warning you, don’t you dare have any indecent thoughts about the woman that I have my fancy, or I’ll make a quick work of your face,” Fleeting Time pursed his lips, “Oh, by the way, I’m going to do it in real life the next time.”</p>
