 <p>Chapter 324 Assassins&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Even you would have trouble handling their attack.” Ye Ci was able to guess that Golden Era’s men would be at the level of lvl58 to lvl60. With their ability to work as a unit and the expected quality of their equipment, Ye Ci knew that she would not be able to gain the upper hand if ten of them went after her.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It was apparent that Golden Era had been planning for this for a long time, and they were even more prepared than she had anticipated. She thought that she could limit Golden Era’s growth by securing the Mithril ore veins, but she was too naive.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Oh, one more thing.” Green Hill’s Moon sighed after a long silence from Ye Ci.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“What is it?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“They have started to collect information about you.” he said in a low voice, “I did not give them your complete information, and I have even provided them with some fake ones. I do not know if they will send someone else to buy information about you from me, but they did it once yesterday. With how they do things previously, their assassins will be going after you within 3 days. And since it’s you, I think they will be sending 20 of their men.” Ye Ci raised an eyebrow.&nbsp;<em>So they’re not going to just leave me alone after all.&nbsp;</em>She had expected them to make a move, but never in her wildest dream did she anticipate for them to come for her so soon, “Have they bought my location from you?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“They tried, but I told them that you’re in an unknown map that I can’t reach. I think they will try to acquire your whereabouts through other means. Be careful out there” said Green Hill’s Moon, “I remember you still have the bounty of the 3 major Northern Continent guilds on you. They have a lot to gain for killing you.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I will.” Ye Ci narrowed her eyes. She was no pushover. Even if Golden Era were to come after her, she would give them a run for their money.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Oh, there’s something else that you should know as well.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“What is it?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“They have also bought information about Lethal Poison, Fleeting Time, and Spotless Autumn as well. But they were unable to locate Spotless Autumn. Even I do not know where that guy is hiding. He should be safe at the moment. Lethal Poison on the other hand had already been attacked.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“How did it go?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“They failed. He took out three of them. Rumour has it that a Secret Cloak was dropped by one of his assassins.” as the best information broker in Fate, there was little that Green Hill’s Moon did not know.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“And what about..” a frown appeared on &nbsp;Ye Ci’s face at the thought of that person, and she did not finish the sentence. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But Green Hill’s Moon knew what she was about to ask, “Fleeting Time’s information was bought 3 days ago. If my estimations are correct, they might be fighting even as we speak. I do not know how it will end, but I will contact you once I have information. You’re both Hunters, so the outcome of his battle might be of use to you.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Alright.” Ye Ci nodded.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You’ll be in danger if you stay in the Mist Forest. Be careful.” Green Hill’s Moon spoke to Ye Ci as if she was an old friend, and disconnected the call.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She was sitting on the branch of a very tall tree, and Ol’ Six was slowly munching on a piece of roasted beef beside her. The Dragon was now the size of a horse and was at lvl35. It was starting to look more and more like a proper Dragon. But because he has not evolved into the next tier, Ol’ Six still looked silly to Ye Ci.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Meat was plentiful in the Mist Forest due to its high population of beast-type monsters. Despite Ol’ Six’s current size, he was still a cub, and was still not able to be used in combat. It could only be sent into battle at Tier 7, but Ye Ci had not found a way to ascend her pet yet.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As Ye Ci rested against the trunk, Green Hill’s Moon’s words were replaying in her mind. Is&nbsp;<em>Fleeting Time under attack now, or will he soon be attacked?</em> She took in a deep breath and let out a long sigh. Even she herself had not realised that she was worrying for Fleeting Time.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But she was quick to redirect her attention somewhere else. They were players from different continents, and there was nothing she could do to help him. Even if she wanted to warn him, she did not have the means to contact him. All she could do was to wish him the best of luck. And she was confident that Fleeting Time would fare better if not as well as Lethal Poison. There was really nothing to worry about.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Ci descended from the tree once Ol’ Six was done with his meal, and fired off an arrow at the nearest monster. Ol’ Six flapped its wings clumsily and followed after Ye Ci, casting its only skill, Intimidation at the monster.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The two had been leveling up following such a training regime for some time. Ol’ Six was not interested in fighting, but with its loyalty already at 100% and the enticement from Ye Ci’s roasted meat, he was more than happy to throw itself into battle.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Tan Polang had almost fallen asleep on the bus on his way home. He was satisfied with his performance in the exam, and he was one step closer to securing his scholarship. The hot afternoon sun shone down on the ground on his face.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The urge to sleep washed over him once again. It was a 1-hour trip from school back home. With nothing else to do, the trip was a long and arduous one.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>His phone beeped just when he let out yet another yawn. One glance at the sender of the message was able to wash away his fatigue.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It was a message from Fleeting Time.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The man had made a long call to Tan Polang after getting his phone number. The 2-hours long conversation was mostly Tan Polang catching up with Fleeting Time, but he had also made his intentions clear.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Firstly, he liked Gongzi You.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Secondly, he needed to know the relationship between Tan Polang and Gongzi You.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>And thirdly, he wanted Tan Polang to play matchmaker between him and Gongzi You.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;His requests were all accepted by Tan Polang who saw gossipping as his life. He completely sold Ye Ci out to Fleeting Time.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Fleeting Time did betray any reaction after receiving the information from Tan Polang, but their conversation had also opened up a window for him to communicate more often with the boy. Tan Polang would always receive a message from Fleeting Time without fail on his way home from school. Today was no exception.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But what he received today was very peculiar. “Has Gongzi You been assassinated recently?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Assassination? That’s scary!&nbsp;</em>Tan Polang was shocked.&nbsp;<em>Did something happen to Sister Ye when I was away?</em> “Are you talking about the bounty? Who else other than you can take her on?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I wouldn’t have asked if it’s just that. Try finding out when you get home and tell me.” Fleeting Time did not divulge more information.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Oh, alright then.” Tan Polang would never refuse a request from Fleeting Time especially when it also benefits Ye Ci. He did not know what was going on, and interpersonal communication was not Fleeting Time’s strong suit. Tan Polang’s only source of clue was Bai Mo.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Zuo Xiaolan and Ye Nantian were preparing dinner when Tan Polang arrived home. He was told to take a shower and to call Ye Ci and Bai Mo down for dinner. Bai Mo was climbing out of his gaming cabin when Tan Polang returned to his room after taking a shower. And the boy began asking Bai Mo about events that happened in game. He was quickly able to piece together the intention behind Fleeting Time’s question.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It came as a huge shock to him, “No way, Golden Era is acting that boldly?! Won’t that make them targets for retaliation?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“It’s still not widely known yet. It’s still all rumors and speculations at the moment. Nobody could prove that Golden Era was behind it. But I think the major guilds will be acting soon.” Bai Mo put on a change of clothes and continued, “Be careful whenever you’re online. Don’t go anywhere alone especially when you’re not in a city.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Tan Polang nodded, and he asked after a slight pause, “But isn’t Sister Ye alone? Do you think she’ll be safe?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Let’s just hope that she’ll be careful,” Bai Mo let out a long sigh.&nbsp;</p>
