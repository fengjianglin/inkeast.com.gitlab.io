 <p>Chapter 430 An Exchange</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>What Zero Arsenic said has nothing to do with me.</em> This was the conclusion that Ye Ci made after listening to his words.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Zero Arsenic studied Ye Ci’s expression intently. He was trying to tell what was going on in her mind. But what he found was disappointing, for she was still wearing a mask of indifference.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I know it doesn’t matter who your opponent is. But it matters to us a lot. If you defeat him, Unbridled Willow will not be able to face off against that man, and this…” he continued after a pause, “Is something that Battle Spear did not want.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In truth, Ye Ci could already guess who her opponent would be when Zero Arsenic approached her with the request.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He wanted her to forfeit her match. She stared at the Vice Leader of Battle Spear guild. The man was by Thousand Sunsets’s side when she first started the game, but he was now working against his former leader.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Ci stood up, took a few steps away from the leg, and once again returned to her original position, dipping her legs back into the water. She attempted to recall a memory from her distant past.&nbsp;<em>Was Zero Arsenic still with Thousand Sunsets back then?</em> But try as she might, her question was left unanswered.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Ah, the irony of life</em>.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Zero Arsenic made no moves to disrupt Ye Ci’s train of thoughts. He stood silently not far behind the Huntress and waited for her to make her decision.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She finally turned around to face him with a smile after a long moment of silence, “And what will I get in return?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Zero Arsenic let out a sigh of relief. Gongzi You was asking for compensation meant that the matter was as good as settled, “Very well. Allow me to tell you a secret about Golden Era.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Oh?” Ye Ci’s interest was piqued.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Zero Arsenic motioned for her to come closer, he began whispering into her ears, “Golden Era will be attacking Sodom, and they’ll do it on…”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Ci was shocked when Zero Arsenic proceeded to reveal the date and time of Golden Era’s planned attack on the abandoned fort, “How did you get that information?” she stared mouth agape at the Vice Leader of Battle Spear.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“There is no information we can’t acquire.” Zero Arsenic smiled at Ye Ci, “Even Green Hill’s Moon knows nothing about this. What do you think of it?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“How can I be sure that you’re not lying to me?” Ye Ci was quick to calm herself down. She was not doubting Zero Arsenic’s capabilities, as he was backed by a large financial group. But she had to be very careful as Sodom was involved. Bai Mo had placed the guild’s entire wealth in preparation to attack the abandoned fort.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Gongzi You, we were never enemies.” Zero Arsenic patted Ye Ci on the shoulder.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You’ll regret lying to me.” replied Ye Ci after a short moment of silence.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“And that, you don’t have to worry.” Zero Arsenic chuckled, “Battle Spear had no intention of becoming enemies with Gongzi You. We don’t want to deal with two top players.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Hmm… There’s something I have to tend to in real life. Guess I’ll have to forfeit my next match.” said Ye Ci as she gazed out towards the lake.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Aiya, that’s a shame.” Zero Arsenic’s smile grew wider, “I was actually looking forward to it.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Ci laid down once again when Zero Arsenic was gone. She then contacted Bai Mo and relayed the information to him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Your info came just in time. We’ll be in trouble if they catch us off guard on that day.” said Bai Mo after he recovered from his initial shock.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Ci shared the same thought as well.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Why would Zero Arsenic tell you something like this?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“My next opponent is Thousand Sunsets, and he wanted me to forfeit. I agreed.” Ye Ci did not hide the truth from Bai Mo.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I see.” Bai Mo sighed, “So that’s why.” and he let out a laugh, “I guess one person’s trash is another person’s treasure. Information about Golden Era is so important to us, but it did not matter to Zero Arsenic.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Yup.” Ye Ci nodded, “My fight against Thousand Sunsets might be insignificant, but it can decide the future of those two.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Ci pulled out her bow and fired off an arrow after ending her call with Bai Mo. The arrow soared through the air in a beautiful arc before landing and disappearing into the lake.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Life was just like an arrow that was shot from a bow. There was no turning back.&nbsp;</p>
