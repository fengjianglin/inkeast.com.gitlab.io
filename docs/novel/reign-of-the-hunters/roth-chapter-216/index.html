 <p><strong>Chapter 202 Congratulations (Part 2)</strong></p>
 <p>After doing the last thing he could to help the party, Raging Tides charged into the circle without hesitation.</p>
 <p>Ye Ci’s sight never strayed away from Dani’s health. She paid close attention to the BOSS’s hitpoints while also silently counting the number of players alive and also keeping up her attacks on the BOSS. She was very busy.</p>
 <p>The members of the party knew that they were at a very crucial moment. They began chugging down all sorts of potion and casting different buffs on themselves in an attempt to deal more damage to the BOSS before time ran out.</p>
 <p>Only 9 players were alive when Dani had 2% of her hitpoints remaining. Ye Ci was pressured. 2% might not seem to be a lot, but it was a huge uncertainty if the 9 of them could defeat Dani.</p>
 <p>Ye Ci was not the only one who realised how dire the situation was. The members who were alive were going all out on the BOSS, while those who were dead cheered them on.</p>
 <p>Since the “dead” was unable to speak, chat bubbles began to rise from the corpses, cheering the living on. Ye Ci felt a sliver of warmth creeping into her heart as she read the words of encouragement.</p>
 <p>So this is what it means to be have team. So this is what it means to have a team that is willing to accept her!</p>
 <p>Just then, Timely Rain, who was one of the best mage class players in the guild, was called out by the BOSS. He immediately rushed into the circle. He was determined not to go down without a fight.</p>
 <p>Timely Rain was indeed worthy of being one of the best mages in the guild. He was able to deal a lot of damage to the BOSS within the 30 seconds window, bring the health of the BOSS down to 1.4%. Before he fell, Timely Rain shouted out to Ye Ci, “Gongzi, hang in there!”</p>
 <p>However, before he could finish his sentence, Ye Ci’s name was called out by the BOSS as well.</p>
 <p>The party members began laughing at Timely Rain. Because of this incident, he was forever known as the jinx in ‘Upwards Ho!’. Of course, it was something that happened in the future.</p>
 <p>When Ye Ci’s name was called out, she immediately dashed into the circle and summoned Ol’ Four. She began furiously attacking Dani.</p>
 <p>There was only 30 seconds for her left.</p>
 <p>Ye Ci used every ability she had as a Huntress on Dani, and a multiple of dazzling visual effects erupted around the BOSS. The entire party was stunned. Gongzi You was really showing off the true potential of a Huntress when she went all out.</p>
 <p>Her attacks were elegant, dazzling, and deadly. The Hunters in the party were excited to see Ye Ci’s performance. So this is the true potential of the Hunter class!</p>
 <p>Despite her ferocity, Ye Ci was unable to defeat Dani when the 30 seconds ended for her. She dropped dead on the ground with Ol’ Four when Dani had 0.2% of her health remaining.</p>
 <p>Despite the dissatisfaction in her heart, Ye Ci knew for a fact that she has failed to defeat Dani. It was all up to the rest of the members who remained alive. This was her second death in Fate, but her death was not meaningless. It was an honor to have fought and died with her party members.</p>
 <p>Fruit Jelly was the next player to be named by the BOSS.</p>
 <p>As a Cleric who was known for her high DPS, Fruit Jelly did not fail to deliver. With 9 seconds left on the timer and 6 surviving players, Dani was finally defeated.</p>
 <p>“I can’t believe it! I can’t believe it! I will never lose! I’m just… Too tired…” Dani clutched at her face and let out a wail. Her health bar was empty, but she did not fall.</p>
 <p>Fruit Jelly’s attack on Dani did not stop. She began grumbling out loud, “Why is she not dead yet? Why is she not dead yet ?! Will she become enraged or something?”</p>
 <p>Her words were met with anger.</p>
 <p>“Shut up, Fruit Jelly!”</p>
 <p>“If it happens, you’ll be the first to die!”</p>
 <p>“Fruit Jelly, if the BOSS becomes enraged, you’ll pay for all our equipment maintenance today!”</p>
 <p>“Oi oi oi… Cut me some slack! I’m just worried!” Fruit Jelly was dejected. She was merely voicing out her worry.</p>
 <p>Ye Ci unlocked the voice channel, allowing the members to speak freely without having to type. The voice channel immediately bustled with activity. Each and every one of the players were waiting for Dani to fall. If she did not fall, the system will not register her death, and it meant that Upwards Ho! have not cleared the dungeon. All eyes were on Dani, with their owners silently praying that she would simply drop dead.</p>
 <p>However, Dani’s death cinematic was too long, and the party members began losing their patience.</p>
 <p>Ye Ci was not worried. This was a BOSS she had defeated countless times in her past life. She was not at all worried that Dani will go berserk. She knew that the BOSS will fall very soon.</p>
 <p>“F*ck! Is she going to die or not?” White Snow, who was one of the surviving players began stabbing Dani on the buttocks with his dagger, “If you don’t die now I’ll take claim the first blood on your chrysanthemum!”</p>
 <p>“You perv!” Fruit Jelly voice out her disdain at White Snow.</p>
 <p>The remaining party members followed their lead and began attacking Dani with their weapons.</p>
 <p>Ye Ci was dumbfounded by their actions. She decided against stopping her members. Even if every BOSS had their own dignity, it was not her rights to stop the players from venting their frustration. She averted her gaze, and pretended that the scene unfolding in front of her did not happen.</p>
 <p>“I think… I need… Some rest… I really, really…” Dani finally walked towards her throne, and slumped onto the throne.</p>
 <p>“Is she dead?”</p>
 <p>“I don’t know!”</p>
 <p>As the players continued their assault on Dani’s corpse, the system notification rang up.</p>
 <p>“Congratulations Upwards Ho! for achieving First Clear of the 100-player dungeon, Castle Ruins at Normal difficulty. Rewards: Guild Prestige x2000, Global Prestige x2000, Gold coins x15000. Let us remember the names of the heroes!”</p>
 <p>“Congratulations Remote Depths for achieving First Blood in the 100-player dungeon, Castle Ruins at Normal difficulty. Rewards: Black Stone City Prestige x500, Talent Points x8. Achievement: “Normal Difficulty Castle Ruins First Five”. His name shall forever be remembered in the history of Fate!”</p>
 <p>“Congratulations Gongzi You for achieving First Blood in the 100-player dungeon, Castle Ruins at Normal difficulty. Rewards: Black Stone City Prestige x500, Talent Points x8. Achievement: “Normal Difficulty Castle Ruins First Five”. Her name shall forever be remembered in the history of Fate!”</p>
 <p>“Congratulations Little Icy Cold Hands for achieving First Blood in the 100-player dungeon, Castle Ruins at Normal difficulty. Rewards: Black Stone City Prestige x500, Talent Points x8. Achievement: “Normal Difficulty Castle Ruins First Five”. His name shall forever be remembered in the history of Fate!”</p>
 <p>“Congratulations Let Go Of That Girl for achieving First Blood in the 100-player dungeon, Castle Ruins at Normal difficulty. Rewards: Black Stone City Prestige x500, Talent Points x8. Achievement: “Normal Difficulty Castle Ruins First Five”. His name shall forever be remembered in the history of Fate!”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>As Ye Ci was not the party leader, she did not receive a confirmation from the system. Bai Mo who was the leader would of course chose to announce their names. There was no way Bai Mo would let go of a chance to advertise their guild to the world.</p>
 <p>Ye Ci who was very anxious to achieve First Clear would of course not stop Bai Mo from doing so. After all, it was beneficial to the guild. She turned off the recording function of her game. There was no need for Unbridled Willow to see the loot dropped by the BOSS.</p>
 <p>“Aiya, we’ve got First Blood!” the members of the party screamed out their joy. The cheers was so loud that Ye Ci could feel her eardrums rupturing. She immediately turned off her voice chat.</p>
 <p>Since they’ve managed to clear the dungeon, none of the players waited for Fruit Jelly to cast Resurrection. They immediately respawned as the spawn point was not far away.</p>
 <p>As usual, Ye Ci was not involved in the looting. She backed away from Dani’s corpse and healed herself up before resurrecting Ol’ Four.</p>
 <p>At that moment, her private message channel was flooded with messages. She did not have to take a look to know who were the senders of the messages. They were probably the leaders of all the major guilds trying to buy the dungeon clearing guide from her.</p>
 <p>She ignored each and every one of them and shouted at Bai Mo, “Remote Depths!”</p>
 <p>“What is it?” Bai Mo, who was ready to loot the BOSS’s corpse turned around when he heard Ye Ci’s call. “What is it?” he sent a private message to Ye Ci.</p>
 <p>“The major guilds are trying to buy dungeon-clearing videos and guides from me. You know what to do.”</p>
 <p>“Don’t tell me you’ve sold the guide to someone?” Bai Mo knew Ye Ci very well. He was immediately able to guess Ye Ci’s intention.</p>
 <p>“Yup.”</p>
 <p>“Who did you sell it to?” curiosity washed over Bai Mo before he was hit by suddenly realization, “Could it be… Unbridled Willow?”</p>
 <p>“Why are you so smart?” Ye Ci laughed.</p>
 <p>“Of course! Do you know who I am? I am your genius cousin!” Bai Mo answered arrogantly, “How much did you sell it for?”</p>
 <p>“22 million.”</p>
 <p>“That’s rather low!” Bai Mo pursed his lips, “That’s like 4 million in real world currency. We have to split it among so many members, and then there’s the guild’s expenditure…”</p>
 <p>“In real world currency.”</p>
 <p>Ye Ci received no reply from Bai Mo. When she stole a glance at his direction, he has already fainted.</p>
 <p>Both Ye Ci and Bai Mo were not from wealthy families. For them, 22 million was a huge sum of money that they would never even dare to dream of. To have such a large sum of money falling onto his lap, it was no wonder that Bai Mo fainted.</p>
 <p>Ye Ci pursed her lips. Ignoring Bai Mo, she began muting all her private message channels. When she saw a voice call from Unbridled Willow, she picked up the call without hesitation.</p>
 <p>“Congratulations, Gongzi You! Really, congratulations!”,Unbridled Willow’s excited voice immediately entered her ears. It was as if he was the one who have achieved the First Blood instead of Ye Ci.</p>
 <p>Ye Ci pursed her lips and replied softly, “Congratulations to you as well. I wonder if you’re congratulating me, or are you congratulating yourself?”</p>
 <p>Unbridled Willow paid no mind to Ye Ci’s sarcasm. After his earlier dealings with the girl, he knew that it was best to ignore her taunts, or he will be angered to death some day.</p>
 <p>“I’ve sent you the money. 55 million gold coins. You’ll receive them once you leave the dungeon.”</p>
 <p>“Alright, I’ll get in contact once I’ve made sure that the amount is correct.” Ye Ci nodded, as if she was not excited to receive the payment.</p>
 <p>However, Unbridled Willow could barely contain his excitement, “When can you give me the video?”</p>
 <p>“I’ll get in touch once I’ve confirmed the payment. Of course, I’ll need to talk to my guild members about this first. After all, this is the result of their hard work.” Ye Ci was as excited as Unbridled Willow, who was biggest benefactor of this deal.</p>
 <p>Despite his anxiety, Unbridled Willow knew that haste will ruin everything. He was able to keep his composure, “Alright. I await your good news.” said Unbridled Willow. Despite that, Unbridled Willow was still slightly worried, “Of course, I hope that you won’t make me wait too long for that video.”</p>
 <p>Unbridled Willow’s words fell on deaf ears. Ye Ci let out a laugh and disconnected from the call. She cast a glance at Bai Mo, who was slowly recovering from his shock. He gave Ye Ci a thumbs up the moment he opened his eyes.</p>
